## If you want to:

- Integrate deep learning-powered features into a Unity project.
- Understand the possible applications and use cases that deep learning enables in Unity.
- Understand the real-world considerations and constraints of adding deep learning-powered features to your Unity project.
- Understand and leverage the existing tools that can increase efficiency or reduce time-to-shipping features.



## Then I can help:

- Provide a cross-disciplinary perspective that considers the needs of the deep learning project, the larger Unity project, and the desired business outcomes.
- Assess the viability of a deep learning feature and develop a proof-of-concept before committing to expensive coding.
- Make risk-management decisions about using immature tooling when it offers an innovation, speed, or capabilities advantage.



## I’m a good choice to help you because:

- I have experience doing this (see my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/cj-mills))
- I have experience providing decision-makers with actionable advice in this area.
- I have been asked by Intel to write tutorials about this stuff, and you can see the results of this work here:
  - How to perform object detection in the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine with the [OpenVINO™ Toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/openvino-toolkit/overview.html) ([link](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/developing-openvino-object-detection-unity-setup.html))
  - How to create an in-game style transfer plugin that leverages the [OpenVINO™ Toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/openvino-toolkit/overview.html) for the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine ([link](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/training/developing-openvino-inferencing-plugin-for-unity.html))
  - How to perform targeted in-game style transfer in Unity ([link](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/training/targeted-in-game-style-transfer-tutorial.html))
  - How to perform human [pose estimation](https://www.fritz.ai/pose-estimation/) in [Unity](https://unity.com/) with the [Barracuda](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.barracuda@3.0/manual/index.html) inference library ([link](https://christianjmills.com/Barracuda-PoseNet-Tutorial-1/))
