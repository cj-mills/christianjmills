My name is Christian Mills, but I go by C.J. when formality is not required. I started this blog in 2020 so that I would have a place to write about projects I work on as well as anything interesting I learn along the way. I have never enjoyed writing, but I canâ€™t deny the value I have received through creating content for this site. Writing has helped me improve my own understanding of the topics I learn about and the site provides a convenient reference when I forget something.

My work for this site has also provided opportunities to meet and collaborate with people in different countries. Global communication is nothing new, but I still find being able to talk with people on the other side of the planet to be pretty awesome.

I have been pleasantly surprised to learn some people have actually found the content here to be useful. The seemingly endless amount of high-quality content that people make freely available online has changed my life so dramatically that it is a bit scary to consider where I would be without it. I am glad that I have been able to pay that forward in some small way.

## Interests

A lot of my interests that I explore in this blog can be attributed to a passion for exploring how technology can be used to unlock human potential.

At the moment, I am following this passion by working on projects that help democratize the power of deep learning. Some of these projects involve lowering the barrier for leveraging deep learning capabilities in real-time content creation tools like Unity and Unreal Engine.

I believe that combining deep learning with powerful creation tools has massive potential for multiple fields from education to game development. Additionally, these powerful creation tools can help democratize deep learning by providing a way to easily generate high-quality synthetic training data.

I also have a strong passion for exploring alternative methods of education and making complex topics more approachable. I am especially excited about the potential of virtual environments as a teaching medium. Virtual environments make it possible to have classrooms where reality is fully customizable and can be tailored to specific lessons and even individual students.
