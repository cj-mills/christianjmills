The code in this tutorial targets Linux platforms, but most of it should also work on macOS and Windows. 

However, Python multiprocessing works differently on those platforms, requiring some changes to leverage multi-processing for the `DataLoader` objects.

I've made a dedicated version of the tutorial code to run on Windows. The included changes should also work on macOS, but I don't have a Mac to verify.
