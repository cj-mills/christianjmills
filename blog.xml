<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-fine-tuning-when-to-use-it">What is fine-tuning? When to use it?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is fine-tuning?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Training a model to follow a set of input-output examples.</li>
<li>Teaching the model to output specific responses for given inputs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>When to use fine-tuning?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Following a specific format or tone:</strong> e.g., writing in a consistent style.</li>
<li><strong>Processing input in a particular way:</strong> e.g., extracting specific information from text.</li>
<li><strong>Following complex instructions:</strong> When the base model struggles with specific instructions.</li>
<li><strong>Improving latency (speed) and reducing token usage (cost):</strong> Compared to multi-shot prompting, fine-tuning can be faster and cheaper.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>When NOT to use fine-tuning?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teaching the model new knowledge:</strong> Fine-tuning is not effective for adding new information to the model’s knowledge base. Use RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) or custom models for this purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Performing multiple, unrelated tasks:</strong> A single fine-tuned model is best suited for one task. Create separate models for different tasks or use prompt engineering.</li>
<li><strong>Including up-to-date information:</strong> Fine-tuning is not suitable for incorporating real-time or constantly changing data.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="custom-models-and-real-world-fine-tuning-examples" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="custom-models-and-real-world-fine-tuning-examples">Custom Models and Real-World Fine-tuning Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> What are “custom models”?
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custom models</strong> involve a deeper level of collaboration with OpenAI.</li>
<li>OpenAI works with select partners to train and refine models using large datasets over several months.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> OpenAI collaborated with Harvey, a legal tech company, to create a model trained on case law. This model excels in legal tasks and significantly reduces hallucinations compared to the base GPT model.
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog Post:</strong> <a href="https://openai.com/index/harvey/">Harvey</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Are there detailed examples of fine-tuning for real-world use cases, including training data and prompts?
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>OpenAI’s cookbook (<a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/">cookbook.openai.com</a>) offers a Q&amp;A model example.
<ul>
<li>The model is trained to respond with “I don’t know” when it lacks relevant knowledge.</li>
<li>This example demonstrates how fine-tuning can improve a model’s ability to recognize its limitations.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Repository:</strong> <a href="examples/fine-tuned_qa">examples/fine-tuned_qa</a></li>
<li><strong>Notebook 1:</strong> <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/fine-tuned_qa/olympics-1-collect-data">Fine-Tuned Q&amp;A - collect data</a></li>
<li><strong>Notebook 2:</strong> <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/fine-tuned_qa/olympics-2-create-qa">Fine-Tuned Q&amp;A - create Q&amp;A</a></li>
<li><strong>Notebook 3:</strong> <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/fine-tuned_qa/olympics-3-train-qa">Fine-Tuned Q&amp;A - train</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The “<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/optimizing-llm-accuracy">Optimizing LLMs for Accuracy</a>” guide on the OpenAI developer site provides a helpful framework for deciding when to use fine-tuning, RAG, or both.
<ul>
<li>The guide includes a chart illustrating different approaches based on the need for adding context versus optimizing responses.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="a-combined-approach" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-combined-approach">A Combined Approach</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> What does it mean to combine fine-tuning and RAG, as shown in the upper-right quadrant of the “Optimizing LLMs” chart?
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The chart depicts a general progression, but specific applications may not require all steps.</li>
<li>Combining fine-tuning and RAG involves:
<ul>
<li>Using RAG to introduce new knowledge or context.</li>
<li>Using fine-tuning to modify the model’s response style or instruction-following capabilities.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="importance-of-evals-evaluation-metrics" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="importance-of-evals-evaluation-metrics">Importance of Evals (Evaluation Metrics)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Define your own set of <strong>evals</strong> (evaluation metrics) tailored to your application’s specific needs.</li>
<li><strong>Why not use standard benchmarks?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Standard benchmarks might not accurately reflect your application’s requirements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Create evals based on real prompts and desired responses from your application.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="a-cautionary-tale-when-fine-tuning-goes-wrong" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-cautionary-tale-when-fine-tuning-goes-wrong">A Cautionary Tale: When Fine-tuning Goes Wrong</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> A company tried to create a Slack bot using fine-tuning on their entire Slack corpus.
<ul>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> The bot was intended to answer onboarding questions from new employees.</li>
<li><strong>Problem:</strong> The model learned the format of Slack responses but not the underlying information.
<ul>
<li>It often responded with deferrals like “I’ll do that tomorrow” or “Okay.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reason for Failure:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The model focused on replicating common responses instead of understanding the content.</li>
<li>This approach violated the principle of not using fine-tuning to add new knowledge.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Better Approach:</strong> Using RAG on the Slack data to provide the model with relevant information.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="preparing-data-for-fine-tuning" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="preparing-data-for-fine-tuning">Preparing Data for Fine-tuning</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Format:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Similar to the chat completions API, using system, user, and assistant messages.</li>
<li>Include the desired assistant response for each user message.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation:</strong> <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/chat-input">Training format for chat models</a></li>
<li><strong>Documentation:</strong> <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/completions-input">Training format for completion models</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Recommendations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number of Examples:</strong> 50-100 examples per task.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on a Single Task:</strong> Use a single fine-tuned model for one specific task.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency in Prompt Structure:</strong> Maintain consistency between the prompt structure used in fine-tuning and in actual application calls.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="handling-multi-turn-conversations-and-internal-thoughts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="handling-multi-turn-conversations-and-internal-thoughts">Handling Multi-Turn Conversations and Internal Thoughts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How to handle multi-turn conversations with RAG, function calling, and internal thoughts (generated by tools like Langchain) during fine-tuning data preparation? Should all internal thoughts be included, even if they are not always present in production?
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Experiment with the <strong>weight parameter</strong> to control which parts of the conversation the model should focus on learning.</li>
<li>The weight parameter allows you to assign different levels of importance to different messages in the training data.</li>
<li><strong>General Advice:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Avoid excessive complexity in fine-tuning. If multi-turn conversations prove too complex, consider simplifying or using alternative approaches.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Follow-up Question:</strong> Is a weight parameter of 0 equivalent to setting the label of those tokens to -100 (effectively ignoring them)?
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A weight of 0 means the model won’t learn how to generate those specific messages (e.g., user and system messages).</li>
<li>However, it will still use them as context when learning how to generate other messages.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section id="evolution-of-the-weight-parameter-and-openais-development-process" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evolution-of-the-weight-parameter-and-openais-development-process">Evolution of the Weight Parameter and OpenAI’s Development Process</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observation:</strong> The introduction of the weight parameter was a significant development. However, its rollout wasn’t widely publicized.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How does OpenAI decide on new features and gather feedback? Could this process be more transparent?
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>OpenAI gathers feedback from various sources:
<ul>
<li>OpenAI Developer Forum</li>
<li>Direct customer interactions</li>
<li>Account managers</li>
<li>Events, conferences, and talks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The weight parameter was a direct result of this feedback process.</li>
<li>OpenAI acknowledges the importance of a more prominent announcement for such features.</li>
<li><strong>Future Direction:</strong> OpenAI plans to continue adding models, methods, and customization options to its fine-tuning platform.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="establish-a-baseline" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="establish-a-baseline">Establish a baseline</h4>
<ul>
<li>Often users start with a zero-shot or few-shot prompt to build a baseline evaluation before graduating to fine-tuning.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="optimize-for-latency-and-token-efficiency" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="optimize-for-latency-and-token-efficiency">Optimize for latency and token efficiency</h4>
<ul>
<li>When using GPT-4, once you have a baseline evaluation and training examples, consider fine-tuning 3.5 to get similar performance for less cost and latency.
<ul>
<li>Experiment with reducing or removing system instructions with subsequent fine-tuned model versions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="hyperparameters" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hyperparameters">Hyperparameters</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Epochs:</strong> The number of times the training data is iterated over.
<ul>
<li>Impacts training the most.</li>
<li>Higher epochs risk overfitting, lower epochs might lead to underfitting.</li>
<li>OpenAI automatically chooses a default based on dataset size.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Batch Size and Learning Rate Multiplier:</strong> Have less impact but can be adjusted for optimization.
<ul>
<li>Larger batch sizes tend to work better for larger datasets.</li>
<li>Experiment with learning rates between <code>0.02-0.2</code>.</li>

</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="reducing-hallucinations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reducing-hallucinations">Reducing Hallucinations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> The Q&amp;A model in OpenAI’s cookbook demonstrates how to reduce hallucinations.
<ul>
<li><strong>Approach:</strong> The model is trained on Olympic-related questions. If the question falls outside this domain, it’s designed to respond with “I don’t know.”</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Fine-tuning effectively minimizes false positives (incorrect answers) in this scenario.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="adoption-rate-of-fine-tuning-and-open-source-alternatives" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adoption-rate-of-fine-tuning-and-open-source-alternatives">Adoption Rate of Fine-tuning and Open Source Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observation:</strong> Less than 1% of OpenAI API users utilize fine-tuning.
<ul>
<li><strong>Reason:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fine-tuning is a more advanced technique used for optimization or when other methods are insufficient.</li>
<li>Many users find success with base models and simpler approaches.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="language-model-agents-and-function-calling-internals" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="language-model-agents-and-function-calling-internals">Language Model Agents and Function Calling Internals</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Are there any impressive examples of OpenAI being used to create successful language model agents?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Steven defers to another team specializing in agents and tool calling.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Interest:</strong> Steven finds the GitHub AI workspaces and their agent-like capabilities for coding tasks promising.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Is there tension between the abstraction provided by higher-level services (like the assistance API) and fine-tuning, especially regarding data access and transparency?
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fine-tuned models can be used within the assistance API.</li>
<li>The assistance API primarily aids in context management and tool access, not necessarily replacing fine-tuning.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Follow-up Question:</strong> If the assistance API modifies or truncates context, wouldn’t that impact fine-tuning?
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Steven acknowledges the potential issue but lacks specific details about the assistance API’s internal context handling.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Regarding function calling, is it true that JSON schema definitions are translated into a Hyperscript-like format before processing? Can users leverage this for simpler function definitions?
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Steven confirms that all inputs, including JSON schemas, are converted into OpenAI’s internal token format.</li>
<li>He can’t share specifics about the internal representation or translation process.</li>
<li><strong>General Direction:</strong> OpenAI aims to make the default function calling experience (using JSON schemas) the most effective, without requiring users to rely on workarounds or internal knowledge.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="log-likelihoods-assessing-the-probability-of-expected-outputs">1. Log Likelihoods: Assessing the Probability of Expected Outputs</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LLMs output a probability distribution over vocabulary for each possible next token.</li>
<li>This distribution represents the model’s confidence in different words following the given input.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Input:</strong> A prompt (X) and a potential output (Y).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Process:</strong> Calculate the probability of the model generating Y given X. This involves summing the log probabilities of each token in Y, conditioned on the preceding tokens in X and Y.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Clog%20P(y%7Cx)%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bi=0%7D%5E%7Bm-1%7D%20%5Clog%20p(y_i%20%7C%20x,%20y_0,%20%5Cldots,%20y_%7Bi-1%7D)%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bi=0%7D%5E%7Bm-1%7D%20l(n+i,%20y_%7Bi%7D)%0A"></p></li>
<li><p>where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clog%20p(y_i%20%7C%20x,%20y_0,%20%5Cldots,%20y_%7Bi-1%7D)"> is the log probability of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">-th target token conditioned on the full input <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> and the preceding target tokens. (and where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x,%20y_0,%20%5Cldots,%20y_%7Bi-1%7D"> denotes conditioning on only <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x">.).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Example:</strong> For the prompt “The cow jumped over the,” calculate the probability of the model generating “moon” versus other words.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Use Case: Multiple Choice Question Answering</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantages:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Computationally cheaper than generation-based evaluation.</li>
<li>Avoids issues with parsing errors in generated text.</li>
<li>Suitable for evaluating smaller LLMs or those in early training stages.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Limited real-world applicability compared to open-ended generation.</li>
<li>Doesn’t assess a model’s ability to formulate its own answers.</li>
<li>Cannot evaluate chain-of-thought reasoning.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Challenges with Log Likelihoods and Perplexity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tokenizer Sensitivity:</strong> Metrics are affected by the specific tokenizer used, making comparisons between models with different tokenizers difficult.
<ul>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> Implement normalization techniques to account for tokenizer variations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Limited Information:</strong> Log likelihoods only consider the probability of a given output, not its overall quality, coherence, or factual accuracy.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="perplexity-measuring-how-well-a-model-fits-a-data-distribution">2. Perplexity: Measuring How Well a Model Fits a Data Distribution</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Concept:</strong> Quantifies how well a language model predicts a given text, indicating its familiarity with the data distribution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Calculation:</strong> Based on the average per-token log probability of the text, with lower perplexity indicating a better fit to the data.</p>

</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Evaluating a model’s understanding of a specific text corpus (e.g., Wikipedia).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain Specificity:</strong> Perplexity on one dataset (e.g., Wikipedia) may not generalize to other domains or tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Insight into Downstream Performance:</strong> A low perplexity doesn’t guarantee good performance in real-world applications like chatbots or question answering.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="text-generation-evaluating-real-world-output-but-facing-scoring-challenges">3. Text Generation: Evaluating Real-World Output but Facing Scoring Challenges</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Importance:</strong> Crucial for assessing LLMs in tasks involving text generation (e.g., chatbots, story writing).</li>
<li><strong>Challenges:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scoring Free-Form Text:</strong> Determining the correctness and quality of generated text is difficult.
<ul>
<li>Simple heuristics (e.g., keyword matching) are unreliable and prone to gaming.</li>
<li>Human evaluation is expensive and time-consuming.</li>
<li>LLM-based judges introduce their own biases and limitations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sensitivity to Prompt Details:</strong> Minor variations in prompts (e.g., trailing whitespace) can drastically impact results, hindering reproducibility.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> In code generation, a trailing tab in the prompt can create syntax errors for models that generate code with specific formatting, leading to artificially lower performance scores.</li>

<section id="qa-highlights" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="qa-highlights">Q&amp;A Highlights:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dataset Quality:</strong> Errors or biases in benchmark datasets can significantly affect evaluation results and limit the usefulness of benchmarks.</li>
<li><strong>Overfitting to Evaluations:</strong> Repeatedly optimizing for a specific benchmark can lead to overfitting, where models excel on the benchmark but fail to generalize to other tasks or data.</li>
<li><strong>Measurement Validity:</strong> It’s essential to ensure that evaluation metrics accurately measure the desired aspects of LLM performance (e.g., factual accuracy, reasoning, coherence).</li>
<li><strong>LLMs as Judges:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits:</strong> LLMs can potentially automate the evaluation of tasks requiring nuanced understanding and reasoning, which are difficult to assess with simple heuristics.</li>
<li><strong>Considerations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Judge Model Selection:</strong> Carefully choose an LLM judge that possesses the necessary capabilities for the task being evaluated.</li>
<li><strong>Judge Model Limitations:</strong> Be aware of the judge model’s own biases and limitations, as these can influence the evaluation outcomes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reliable Multiple-Choice Answers Without Additional Text:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structured Generation:</strong> Use techniques that constrain the model’s output to specific formats.</li>
<li><strong>System Prompts:</strong> Provide clear instructions to the model to only output the answer.</li>
<li><strong>Log Likelihoods:</strong> Rely on log likelihood-based multiple-choice evaluations if structured generation isn’t possible.</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-critical-strait-an-obscure-regulation">A Critical Strait &amp; An Obscure Regulation</h3>
<ul>
<li>On August 18, 2020, the USS Mustin sailed through the Taiwan Strait, a waterway increasingly fraught with geopolitical tension.</li>
<li>This show of force underscored a new reality: <strong>the battle for technological dominance, particularly in semiconductors, has become central to the rivalry between the United States and China.</strong></li>
<li>While the U.S. Navy patrolled the strait, Chinese leaders were more concerned about a U.S. Commerce Department regulation called the <strong>Entity List,</strong> which restricts technology exports.</li>
<li>This regulation targeted <strong>Huawei</strong>, a Chinese tech giant, barring it from buying advanced computer chips made with U.S. technology.
<ul>
<li>This action revealed China’s dependence on foreign-made chips, the essential building blocks of all modern electronics.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-significance-of-semiconductors">The Significance of Semiconductors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Semiconductors, also known as integrated circuits or chips, are the foundation of modern technology.</strong>
<ul>
<li>They power everything from smartphones and refrigerators to military systems and artificial intelligence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Moore’s Law:</strong> In 1965, Gordon Moore observed that the number of transistors on a chip doubles approximately every two years, leading to exponential growth in computing power.
<ul>
<li>This prediction has held true for over half a century, driving the digital revolution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Chips have become ubiquitous and essential:</strong>
<ul>
<li>They are found in nearly every device that requires computing power.</li>
<li>The global economy and our daily lives are deeply reliant on a steady supply of increasingly powerful chips.</li>

<li>This was surprising given US fears of the USSR catching up in science and technology.</li>
<li>Trutko studied advanced technology, even attending lectures by <strong>William Shockley</strong>.
<ul>
<li>After one class, Trutko asked Shockley to sign his book, <em>Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors</em>.</li>
<li>Shockley complained to Trutko that the USSR refused to pay royalties for the book’s Russian translation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The USSR understood the value of semiconductors.
<ul>
<li>They translated Shockley’s textbook into Russian just two years after it was published.</li>
<li>US spies were ordered to acquire Soviet semiconductor devices as early as 1956 to assess their quality.

<ul>
<li>In 1953, <strong>Akio Morita</strong>, co-founder of Sony, traveled to New York and secured a license from AT&amp;T to produce transistors.
<ul>
<li>AT&amp;T believed the transistor’s use was limited to hearing aids.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Morita, however, recognized the transistor’s potential to transform consumer electronics.
<ul>
<li>He aimed to sell these devices not just in Japan, but also in the US, the world’s biggest consumer market.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Japan’s government, through MITI (Ministry of International Trade and Industry), supported the growth of its electronics firms.
<ul>
<li>However, their bureaucracy sometimes clashed with the private sector.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Jack Simplot</strong>, an Idaho billionaire known for his potato empire, invested in <strong>Micron Technology</strong>, a struggling DRAM chip manufacturer.
<ul>
<li>Simplot’s expertise was in potatoes, evident from his “Mr.&nbsp;Spud” license plate, but he understood business in a way that Silicon Valley often didn’t.</li>
<li>Simplot made his fortune by pioneering potato processing techniques that led to a massive contract with McDonald’s.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Micron</strong>, founded in 1978 by brothers <strong>Joe and Ward Parkinson</strong>, entered the DRAM market during a time of intense Japanese dominance.
<ul>
<li>Existing American DRAM producers, including <strong>AMD, National Semiconductor</strong>, and <strong>Intel</strong>, were abandoning the market due to billion-dollar losses from Japanese competition.</li>
<li>Micron, initially focused on chip design, was forced to pivot to manufacturing their own chips after losing their only client, <strong>Mostek</strong>, to Japanese competitor <strong>Fujitsu</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Silicon Valley lobbied the government for protection against Japanese competition, claiming that computer chips were strategic assets unlike commodities like potatoes.</li>
<li>Micron, however, initially opposed government intervention, believing they could compete with the Japanese through aggressive cost-cutting.</li>
<li>Micron secured funding from <strong>Alan Noble</strong> and other Boise investors. Facing continued struggles, they approached <strong>Simplot</strong>, who saw an opportunity in the depressed DRAM market and invested $1 million, later increasing his stake to over a billion dollars.
<ul>
<li>Simplot believed that Japanese competition had turned DRAM into a commodity, and the best time to buy a commodity business was during a downturn.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Micron’s competitive edge stemmed from their relentless focus on cost reduction and innovative manufacturing processes.
<ul>
<li><strong>Ward Parkinson</strong>, Micron’s engineering lead, focused on shrinking the chip size to fit more chips onto each silicon wafer, increasing manufacturing efficiency.</li>
<li>Micron simplified manufacturing processes, using fewer steps and less equipment than competitors.</li>
<li>They modified existing lithography machines to exceed manufacturer specifications and adapted furnaces to process more wafers simultaneously.</li>
<li>Micron’s location in Boise offered lower land and electricity costs compared to California or Japan.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Joe Parkinson instilled a culture of cost-consciousness, dimming lights and emphasizing efficiency to employees. This “sweatshop mentality” was driven by the understanding that Micron’s survival was paramount in a place with limited alternative job opportunities.</li>
<li>Micron’s strategy ultimately succeeded.
<ul>
<li>They survived the Japanese onslaught, while most American DRAM producers were driven out of the market.</li>
<li>Micron acquired <strong>Texas Instruments’</strong> DRAM business and became a major player in the memory chip market.</li>
<li>Their success was attributed to their engineering ingenuity, relentless cost-cutting, and Simplot’s unwavering support.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Andy Grove</strong>, Intel’s President, recognized that the company’s DRAM business was being disrupted by Japanese competition and needed a drastic change.
<ul>
<li>Grove was known for his “paranoid” management style, driven by a fear of competition and failure, which he outlined in his book, <strong>Only the Paranoid Survive</strong>.</li>
<li>Grove’s experiences as a Hungarian refugee escaping Soviet oppression shaped his leadership, emphasizing constant vigilance and a drive to overcome challenges.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite Intel’s history and identity being rooted in memory chips, Grove acknowledged that the DRAM market was no longer viable and a shift was necessary for survival.
<ul>
<li>The decision to abandon DRAM was difficult and emotionally charged for Intel, but Grove recognized the need to disrupt themselves before being overtaken by competitors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Grove initiated a painful restructuring process.
<ul>
<li><strong>Step One</strong>: Laying off over 25% of Intel’s workforce and closing facilities in Silicon Valley, Oregon, Puerto Rico, and Barbados.</li>
<li><strong>Step Two</strong>: Implementing a ruthless approach to improve manufacturing, inspired by Japanese methods.
<ul>
<li><strong>Craig Barrett</strong>, Grove’s deputy, led this effort, pushing for the adoption of rigorous processes.</li>
<li>Intel adopted a “<strong>copy exactly</strong>” manufacturing methodology, replicating the most efficient processes across all facilities to ensure consistency and high yields.</li>
<li>This shift from Silicon Valley’s freewheeling engineering culture to a more disciplined and standardized approach was met with internal resistance but ultimately proved successful in increasing efficiency and reducing costs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Several external factors contributed to Intel’s resurgence:
<ul>
<li>The rising value of the Japanese yen against the dollar made American exports cheaper.</li>
<li>Falling interest rates in the US lowered Intel’s capital costs.</li>
<li>The emergence of <strong>Compaq</strong> and other <strong>IBM PC clones</strong> created a new market for Intel’s microprocessors.</li>
<li>These “clone” manufacturers utilized Intel’s chips and Microsoft’s software, driving down PC prices and fueling mass adoption.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By transitioning from DRAM to microprocessors, Intel secured a near-monopoly in the burgeoning PC market, solidifying their position as a leading chip manufacturer.</li>

<li><strong>Lee Byung-chul</strong>, founder of <strong>Samsung</strong>, saw an opportunity in the semiconductor industry amidst the US-Japan DRAM wars.
<ul>
<li>Lee, a shrewd businessman who started by trading dried fish and vegetables, believed in building businesses that were “big, strong, and eternal”.</li>
<li>He recognized the potential of semiconductors after witnessing the success of Japanese companies like <strong>Toshiba</strong> and <strong>Fujitsu</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lee was inspired by <strong>Hewlett-Packard’s</strong> journey from a garage startup to a tech giant during a visit to California in 1982.
<ul>
<li>He was determined to replicate their success with Samsung.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite the high capital expenditure and risk involved, Lee decided to invest at least $100 million in semiconductor manufacturing, a move that could have jeopardized his entire business empire.</li>
<li><strong>Support from the South Korean government was crucial</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The government pledged $400 million to develop the country’s semiconductor industry and pressured banks to provide additional loans to companies like Samsung.</li>
<li>This mirrored the Japanese model of government-backed industrial policy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Silicon Valley, eager to undercut Japanese dominance, saw Korean companies as potential allies.
<ul>
<li><strong>Bob Noyce</strong> believed that Korean competition would prevent Japan from monopolizing DRAM production.</li>
<li>Intel and other Silicon Valley companies formed joint ventures with Samsung, providing them with manufacturing contracts and technology.</li>
<li>The logic was “my enemy’s enemy is my friend,” as <strong>Jerry Sanders</strong> stated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Factors that aided Samsung’s rise:
<ul>
<li>US-imposed tariffs on Japanese DRAM chips created an opening for Korean companies.</li>
<li>Lower wages and production costs in South Korea compared to Japan.</li>
<li>Access to US technology through licensing agreements, such as the deal for a 64K DRAM design from <strong>Micron</strong>.</li>

<ul>
<li>By the 1980s, the limitations of manual chip design were becoming apparent as transistor counts increased.
<ul>
<li>Early microprocessors, like Intel’s 4004, were designed by hand, a time-consuming and error-prone process.</li>
<li><strong>Federico Fagan’s</strong> experience designing Intel’s first microprocessor in 1971 highlighted the challenges: he spent six months meticulously drawing the design, which was then transferred to rubylith film and used to create masks for photolithography.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Carver Mead</strong> and <strong>Lynn Conway</strong> revolutionized chip design by introducing a standardized, algorithmic approach.
<ul>
<li><strong>Carver Mead</strong>, a physicist, and <strong>Lynn Conway</strong>, a computer architect at <strong>Xerox PARC</strong>, collaborated to create a set of mathematical design rules that enabled software to automate the chip design process.</li>
<li>Their methodology allowed designers to use a library of pre-designed components instead of drawing every transistor individually. This “<strong>Mead-Conway revolution</strong>” mirrored <strong>Gutenberg’s</strong> invention of the printing press, simplifying chip design and making it more accessible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)</strong> recognized the strategic importance of the Mead-Conway approach and funded initiatives to promote its adoption.
<ul>
<li>They financed programs for university researchers to design and fabricate chips at advanced facilities, fostering a new generation of chip designers.</li>
<li>DARPA’s focus was on building educational infrastructure and supporting research that would maintain America’s lead in microelectronics, recognizing the crucial role of innovation in national security.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <strong>Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC)</strong>, funded by the chip industry, also played a critical role by distributing research grants to universities.
<ul>
<li>Universities like <strong>Carnegie Mellon</strong> and the <strong>University of California, Berkeley</strong> became hubs for semiconductor research, producing graduates who went on to found companies that developed essential software tools for chip design.</li>
<li>These DARPA and SRC-funded programs nurtured an ecosystem of innovation that led to the creation of companies like <strong>Synopsys, Cadence</strong>, and <strong>Mentor Graphics</strong>, which continue to dominate the chip design software industry today.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Erwin Jacobs</strong>, a pioneer in wireless communication, envisioned using increasingly powerful chips to revolutionize data transmission.
<ul>
<li>Jacobs, who co-founded <strong>Qualcomm</strong>, realized that as transistor density increased, chips would be able to encode and decode significantly more data within the limited bandwidth of radio waves.</li>
<li>He predicted that this would lead to a future where large amounts of data could be transmitted wirelessly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DARPA funding was instrumental in Qualcomm’s early success, supporting the development of space communication systems before the company shifted focus to the civilian market.</li>
<li>Jacobs’ story highlights the importance of government funding in supporting early-stage research and development, particularly in capital-intensive fields like semiconductors.</li>
<li>By the end of the 1980s, thanks to these advancements in chip design, manufacturing, and applications, the unthinkable had become reality: Intel released its 486 microprocessor, containing 1.2 million transistors, a testament to the relentless pace of innovation driven by Silicon Valley and its government and academic partners.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Soviet Union, lagging behind the West in semiconductor technology, relied heavily on espionage to acquire Western chips and manufacturing equipment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Directorate T</strong>, a specialized KGB division established in 1963, was tasked with stealing foreign technology to bolster the Soviet semiconductor industry.</li>
<li>The KGB employed various tactics, including:
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct theft:</strong> Stealing physical chips from companies.</li>
<li><strong>Black market purchases:</strong> Acquiring chips through intermediaries and smugglers.</li>
<li><strong>Blackmail:</strong> Targeting Westerners with access to sensitive technology.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Soviet espionage efforts were extensive:
<ul>
<li>The KGB reportedly had a team of 60 agents in San Francisco focused on infiltrating Silicon Valley companies.</li>
<li>The discovery of a sophisticated Soviet listening device using <strong>Texas Instruments</strong> chips disguised as a buoy in 1982 highlighted the reach and sophistication of their operations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The limitations of the “<strong>copy-it</strong>” strategy:
<ul>
<li>While stealing samples or even shipments of chips was relatively straightforward, replicating the complex manufacturing processes was a significant challenge.</li>
<li>As chip complexity increased, the Soviets struggled to produce high-quality copies, rendering their stolen technology less valuable.</li>
<li>This over-reliance on theft hindered the development of indigenous Soviet semiconductor expertise.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Vladimir Vetrov (codename: Farewell):</strong> A disillusioned KGB agent who became a double agent for France.
<ul>
<li>Vetrov, dissatisfied with his career and personal life, leaked thousands of pages of classified documents about Directorate T’s operations to French intelligence, revealing the vast scale of Soviet technology theft.</li>
<li>He was motivated by a desire for a more exciting life and hoped to rekindle a romantic relationship.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Operation Exodus</strong>: A US-led initiative to counter Soviet technology theft, launched in response to Vetrov’s revelations.
<ul>
<li>The program implemented stricter export controls, increased customs inspections, and targeted Soviet acquisition networks.</li>
<li>By 1985, Operation Exodus had seized $600 million worth of goods and led to numerous arrests.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite the KGB’s efforts, the Soviet Union remained technologically inferior to the West in microelectronics.
<ul>
<li>By the mid-1980s, Soviet microprocessors were estimated to be half a decade behind their American counterparts.</li>
<li>The reliance on the copy-it strategy ultimately proved detrimental, hindering innovation and perpetuating dependence on foreign technology.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov</strong>, chief of the Soviet military, recognized the transformative impact of microelectronics on warfare, predicting that precision-guided weapons would turn conventional explosives into “<strong>weapons of mass destruction</strong>.”</li>
<li>Ogarkov argued that the Soviet Union’s numerical superiority in tanks and troops was becoming increasingly irrelevant in the face of America’s superior precision-guided weapons and surveillance technology.
<ul>
<li>He recognized that <strong>Bill Perry’s offset strategy</strong> of leveraging technology to counter Soviet numerical superiority was succeeding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact of the semiconductor gap on Soviet military capabilities</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Missile technology</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Soviet ballistic missiles were less accurate than their American counterparts due to the limitations of their onboard computers and guidance systems.</li>
<li>The US <strong>MX missile</strong> was estimated to be significantly more accurate than the Soviet <strong>SS-25</strong>, giving the US a strategic advantage in a potential nuclear conflict.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Anti-submarine warfare</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The US Navy’s use of advanced computers, like the <strong>ILLIAC-4</strong>, for analyzing sonar data significantly enhanced their ability to detect and track Soviet submarines.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conventional warfare</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The effectiveness of US precision-guided munitions, such as the <strong>Paveway</strong> laser-guided bombs and <strong>Tomahawk</strong> cruise missiles, significantly increased the vulnerability of Soviet forces in a conventional conflict.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenges faced by the Soviet semiconductor industry</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Political interference</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The KGB’s influence within the industry hindered efficiency and innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Yuri OShokhin’s</strong> removal from the <strong>Riga semiconductor plant</strong> for refusing to dismiss employees targeted by the KGB exemplified this problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lack of a robust consumer market</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The absence of a large civilian market for electronics limited the growth and innovation of the Soviet semiconductor industry.</li>
<li>This contrasted with the US, Europe, and Japan, where booming consumer markets drove demand for advanced chips.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Limited international collaboration</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The Soviet Union’s isolation during the Cold War prevented it from accessing the global semiconductor supply chain and benefiting from specialization and economies of scale.</li>
<li>In contrast, the US and its allies had established an efficient international division of labor in chip production and innovation.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>This overcapacity led to a DRAM glut and falling profits.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Missed opportunities in new markets</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Japanese companies, with the notable exception of <strong>Sony</strong>, failed to capitalize on the rising PC market and largely ignored the growing demand for microprocessors.</li>
<li>This contrasted with Intel’s successful pivot from DRAM to microprocessors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Slow to adapt to changing market dynamics</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The Japanese model of consensus-driven decision-making, which had been an advantage in the past, hindered their ability to adapt quickly to the rapidly changing semiconductor landscape.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sony</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Sony’s success in developing specialized chips for image sensors highlighted the potential for innovation within the Japanese semiconductor industry.</li>
<li>However, even Sony struggled to maintain profitability in the face of increasing competition and the company’s failure to cut investments in loss-making sectors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The decline of Japan’s semiconductor industry undermined its geopolitical ambitions</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Akio Morita’s</strong>, co-author of “The Japan That Can Say No,” witnessed firsthand the decline of Japan’s economic and technological prowess.</li>
<li>The country’s inability to translate its semiconductor dominance into geopolitical power during the Persian Gulf War further highlighted its limitations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Soviet Union’s collapse</strong>:
<ul>
<li>By 1990, <strong>Mikhail Gorbachev</strong>, recognizing the Soviet Union’s dire economic and technological situation, sought closer ties with the West.</li>
<li>During a visit to Silicon Valley, Gorbachev acknowledged the region’s technological leadership and encouraged US investment in the USSR.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ogarkov’s prediction</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Marshal Ogarkov’s</strong> earlier prediction that the US had effectively won the Cold War due to its superior technology proved accurate.</li>
<li>The Soviet Union’s inability to compete in microelectronics and other advanced technologies significantly contributed to its collapse.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The end of the Cold War</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The US emerged victorious, with Silicon Valley’s technological prowess playing a decisive role in securing this victory.</li>
<li>The semiconductor industry had become a critical driver of both economic and military power.</li>

<ul>
<li>By the 1980s, Taiwan aimed to transition from semiconductor assembly to chip fabrication to capture a larger share of the industry’s profits.
<ul>
<li><strong>Semiconductor assembly</strong>, primarily involving testing and packaging chips made elsewhere, offered lower profits than chip design and production.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<section id="early-efforts-and-challenges" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="early-efforts-and-challenges">Early Efforts and Challenges</h4>
<ul>
<li>Taiwan had been strategically integrating itself into semiconductor supply chains since the 1960s.
<ul>
<li><strong>Goals:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Job creation</li>
<li>Acquisition of advanced technology</li>
<li>Strengthened security ties with the United States</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Early successes included attracting Texas Instruments to build the island’s first semiconductor facility in the 1960s.
<ul>
<li>K.T. Lee, a powerful Taiwanese minister, was instrumental in securing TI’s investment and fostering relationships with its leaders, including Pat Haggerty and Morris Chang.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Taiwan further encouraged electronics firms to establish factories on the island.</li>
<li>Despite these efforts, Taiwan faced challenges in advancing its chipmaking capabilities:
<ul>
<li><strong>UMC</strong>, a Taiwanese chipmaker founded in 1980 using licensed technology from America’s RCA, lagged behind the industry’s cutting edge.</li>
<li><strong>Competition:</strong> Taiwan faced fierce competition from other Asian economies:
<ul>
<li><strong>South Korea:</strong> Samsung and other conglomerates were heavily investing in advanced memory chips.</li>
<li><strong>Singapore and Malaysia:</strong> These countries were attempting to replicate South Korea’s transition from assembly to fabrication, but with limited success.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>China’s Emergence:</strong> The People’s Republic of China’s integration into the global economy posed a significant threat.
<ul>
<li>China’s low wages and vast workforce attracted basic manufacturing and assembly jobs, directly challenging Taiwan’s economic model.</li>
<li>Taiwanese officials perceived this as “economic warfare,” as competing with China on price was deemed impossible.</li>

<ul>
<li>In 1985, Minister K.T. Lee recruited Morris Chang, a seasoned semiconductor industry veteran, to lead Taiwan’s push into chip fabrication.
<ul>
<li>Chang had extensive experience at Texas Instruments, playing a key role in establishing TI’s efficient manufacturing processes and the company’s presence in Taiwan.</li>
<li>He had left TI in the early 1980s after being passed over for the CEO position.</li>
<li>Chang’s deep understanding of the industry and proven track record made him an ideal candidate for the challenging task.</li>

<section id="the-foundry-model-a-radical-idea" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-foundry-model-a-radical-idea">The Foundry Model: A Radical Idea</h4>
<ul>
<li>Chang proposed a radical business model—a <strong>“foundry”—</strong>to propel Taiwan’s semiconductor industry forward.
<ul>
<li>This model involved manufacturing chips designed by other companies rather than designing and producing chips in-house, which was the prevailing industry model at the time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chang had first pitched this idea while at TI in 1976, predicting the rise of <strong>“fabless”</strong> companies that focused solely on chip design.
<ul>
<li>However, TI executives rejected the proposal, deeming it too risky to invest in markets that didn’t yet exist.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The concept gained traction due to several factors:
<ul>
<li><strong>Lynn Conway and Carver Mead’s work:</strong> Their revolution in chip design, which simplified the separation of design and manufacturing, made Chang’s foundry model more feasible.</li>
<li><strong>Growing demand:</strong> Chang anticipated that the decreasing cost of computing power would drive demand for semiconductors in a wide range of new applications, creating opportunities for specialized manufacturers.</li>
<li><strong>Rising manufacturing costs:</strong> As transistors shrank and technology advanced, the cost of manufacturing equipment and R&amp;D became increasingly prohibitive for companies producing smaller volumes of chips.</li>

<section id="tsmcs-founding-and-government-support" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tsmcs-founding-and-government-support">TSMC’s Founding and Government Support</h4>
<ul>
<li>Minister Lee secured government funding for Chang’s ambitious plan, with the Taiwanese government providing 48% of TSMC’s startup capital.
<ul>
<li>The government also granted generous tax benefits to support the company’s growth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chang’s former colleagues at TI and Intel declined to provide the necessary advanced production technology.
<ul>
<li>Gordon Moore, of Intel, famously told Chang, “Morris, you’ve had a lot of good ideas in your time. This isn’t one of them.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Eventually, Chang secured a deal with Philips, the Dutch semiconductor company:
<ul>
<li>Philips invested $58 million, transferred its production technology, and licensed intellectual property to TSMC in exchange for a 27.5% stake.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The remaining capital was raised from wealthy Taiwanese families, often through government pressure and appeals to their past successes with government support.</li>
<li>From its inception, TSMC operated as a project of the Taiwanese state, heavily reliant on government support and funding.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-foundry-models-impact-democratization-and-monopolization">The Foundry Model’s Impact: Democratization and Monopolization</h4>
<ul>
<li>TSMC’s foundry model addressed the challenges faced by early fabless chip design firms, providing them with a reliable manufacturing partner and fostering innovation in the industry.
<ul>
<li>Previously, these smaller firms had to rely on larger chipmakers with spare capacity, often facing second-class status, potential intellectual property theft, and inconsistencies in manufacturing processes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>TSMC’s commitment to manufacturing chips designed by its customers, without competing in the design space, built trust and attracted a wide range of clients.</li>
<li>This model, mirroring Carver Mead’s “Gutenberg moment” prediction, significantly lowered the barriers to entry in the chip design industry, leading to a surge in new fabless chip design firms.
<ul>
<li>The availability of affordable, high-quality chip manufacturing enabled these companies to focus on innovation and develop specialized chips for a wide range of applications.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, unlike Gutenberg’s printing press, which spread rapidly across Europe, TSMC’s foundry model, while democratizing chip design, ultimately led to the monopolization of chip manufacturing.
<ul>
<li>The economics of chip fabrication favored large-scale production, with companies like TSMC gaining a significant advantage through higher yields and lower costs per chip.</li>
<li>This dynamic drove relentless consolidation in the industry, with TSMC emerging as the dominant player in the production of the world’s most advanced chips.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lithography</strong> - A process using light to carve circuits onto silicon wafers.</li>
<li>As transistors shrunk due to <strong>Moore’s Law</strong>, traditional lithography methods faced limitations.
<ul>
<li><strong>Moore’s Law:</strong> The observation that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every two years, leading to exponential increases in computing power.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Existing ultraviolet (UV) light techniques with wavelengths of 248 or 193 nanometers would soon be insufficient.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light</strong>, with a wavelength of 13.5 nanometers, was proposed as the solution for producing smaller circuits.
<ul>
<li>Smaller wavelengths enable carving smaller features onto chips.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenge</strong>: Most experts believed mass-producing EUV light was impossible.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>1992</strong>: John Carruthers, Intel’s R&amp;D leader, requested $200 million from CEO Andy Grove to develop EUV lithography.
<ul>
<li>Grove was skeptical, as EUV’s viability was uncertain.</li>
<li>Carruthers argued it was a necessary “research” investment.</li>
<li>Gordon Moore (former CEO and advisor) agreed, highlighting the lack of alternatives if Moore’s Law were to continue.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Outcome</strong>: Grove approved the funding, ultimately leading to billions invested in EUV R&amp;D and implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Intel’s Strategy</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Focused on ensuring at least one lithography company successfully brought EUV machines to market.</li>
<li>Intel needed these tools to continue shrinking circuits on their chips.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-geopolitical-battle-control-and-access">3. The Geopolitical Battle: Control and Access</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Context:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The US emerged from the Cold War as a global superpower.</li>
<li>Globalization and interconnectedness were seen as inevitable and positive.</li>
<li>Intel dominated the microprocessor market.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Intel’s Consortium:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>1996</strong>: Intel partnered with US Department of Energy labs (e.g., Lawrence Livermore, Sandia) to advance EUV.</li>
<li>Goal: Transition EUV from scientific research to mass production.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Choosing ASML:</strong>
<ul>
<li>US firms (GCA defunct, SVG lagging) couldn’t commercialize EUV.</li>
<li>Government opposed Japanese involvement (Nikon, Canon) due to past trade tensions.</li>
<li>ASML, despite being foreign, became the only viable option.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Concerns and Justifications:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Government Concerns:</strong> Giving a foreign company access to sensitive national lab research raised concerns about future access to critical technology.</li>
<li><strong>Counterarguments:</strong>
<ul>
<li>No immediate military application for EUV.</li>
<li>EUV’s success was not guaranteed.</li>
<li>ASML (and the Netherlands) were seen as reliable partners.</li>
<li>Job creation through an ASML facility in the US was prioritized.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Industry Perspective:</strong> Focused on efficient semiconductor production; ASML was the only company capable of delivering EUV.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>ASML’s Monopoly:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nikon and Canon, excluded from US research, abandoned EUV development.</li>
<li><strong>2001</strong>: ASML acquired SVG (US’s last major lithography firm).
<ul>
<li><strong>Concerns:</strong> Further consolidated EUV technology under ASML.</li>
<li><strong>Justifications:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Necessary for EUV progress and the future of computing (argued by Intel CEO Craig Barrett).</li>
<li>Aligned with the Bush administration’s policy of promoting globalization and loosening export controls.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Outcome:</strong>
<ul>
<li>EUV development continued with ASML as the sole supplier.</li>
<li>Concerns about US reliance on a foreign company for this critical technology were dismissed.</li>
<li>The narrative of globalization masked the reality of a single company monopolizing EUV lithography.</li>

<ul>
<li>By 2006, <strong>Intel</strong> supplied the processors for most PCs.
<ul>
<li>They achieved this by fending off <strong>AMD</strong>, the only other major company producing chips using the <strong>x86 instruction set architecture</strong>.
<ul>
<li><strong>x86 instruction set architecture</strong>: A foundational set of rules governing how chips compute; the industry standard for PCs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Apple</strong> was the only major computer maker not using x86-based chips until 2006 when they announced a switch to Intel chips.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Intel’s dominance in the PC market stemmed from <strong>IBM</strong>’s decision to use x86 processors in their first personal computers.
<ul>
<li>This positioned Intel as a controller of a crucial building block in the PC ecosystem, much like <strong>Microsoft</strong> with their operating system, Windows.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While considered complex and bulky compared to the <strong>RISC</strong> architecture, x86 became entrenched due to the cost of change and the threat to Intel’s dominance.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Challenge of Perception:</strong> Many struggled to understand China’s anxieties, given its seemingly powerful tech sector.</li>
<li><strong>Headline Hype vs.&nbsp;Reality:</strong> Media often portrayed China as a leading tech power, particularly in artificial intelligence.</li>
<li><strong>“AI Superpower” Status:</strong> A book by Kai-Fu Lee, former head of Google China, labeled China as one of the world’s two AI superpowers due to its use of AI for surveillance.</li>
<li><strong>Hidden Dependence:</strong> Even China’s advanced surveillance systems, used to monitor dissidents and minorities, relied on chips from American companies like <strong>Intel</strong> and <strong>NVIDIA.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Fragile Foundation:</strong> All of China’s crucial technology rested on a foundation of imported silicon, a vulnerability acknowledged by Chinese leaders.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-imperative-for-domestic-chip-production">The Imperative for Domestic Chip Production</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beyond Supply Chain Security:</strong> Domestic chip production was not just about mitigating supply chain risks; it was also about capturing a larger share of the profits in the global technology market.</li>
<li><strong>“Core Technologies”:</strong> China aspired to produce what its leaders termed “core technologies,” products essential to the global economy, enabling it to move beyond low-profit manufacturing.</li>
<li><strong>The iPhone Example:</strong> China’s role in the iPhone production chain illustrated this challenge; millions of Chinese workers assembled the phones, but most profits went to Apple and chipmakers, not Chinese companies.</li>

<ul>
<li>China sought to emulate the strategies of Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, which had successfully entered the high-value segment of the chip industry. Their strategies included:</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Government Investment and Bank Lending:</strong> Pouring capital into domestic semiconductor companies with government backing and pressure on private banks to provide loans.</li>
<li><strong>Talent Acquisition:</strong> Attracting scientists and engineers trained in U.S. universities and Silicon Valley back to their home countries.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Partnerships:</strong> Forming partnerships with foreign firms, but with stipulations requiring technology transfer or training for local workers.</li>
<li><strong>Exploiting Competition:</strong> Leveraging competition between Silicon Valley companies, and later between American and Japanese firms, to secure the most favorable deals.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taiwan’s Success Story:</strong> KT Lee, a powerful Taiwanese minister, played a key role in establishing <strong>TSMC</strong> (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), a global leader in semiconductor fabrication. His statement to Morris Chang, TSMC’s founder, <strong>“We want to promote a semiconductor industry in Taiwan,”</strong> resonated with Xi Jinping’s ambitions for China.</li>

<li>Despite growing up raising livestock, Zhao aspired for more than a rural life.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Education and Early Career:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Zhao gained admission to Tsinghua University, one of China’s top institutions, where he studied electrical engineering.
<ul>
<li>Note: Tsinghua University has been at the forefront of China’s semiconductor efforts since the industry’s beginnings in the country.</li>
<li>It’s unclear how much semiconductor-specific knowledge Zhao acquired during his studies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>After graduating, he worked at a tech company before transitioning into investing as a vice president at Tsinghua Uni Group.
<ul>
<li><strong>Tsinghua Uni Group:</strong> Established by Tsinghua University to commercialize its research, the company seemingly focused heavily on real estate investments.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Investment Success:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Zhao earned a reputation for skillful corporate deal-making, setting him on a path to substantial wealth.</li>
<li><strong>2004:</strong> Zhao founded his own investment firm, Beijing Jiankun Group.
<ul>
<li><strong>Investment Focus:</strong> Real estate, mining, and other sectors where political connections are often critical for success.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>2009:</strong> Zhao acquired a 49% stake in his former employer, Tsinghua Uni Group, with the university retaining the remaining 51%.
<ul>
<li><strong>Unusual Transaction:</strong> This raised eyebrows as it meant a private real estate investment firm now held significant control over a company meant to commercialize technology from a leading research university.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tsinghua Unigroup’s Political Connections:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The company wasn’t a typical business entity. It had strong ties to the Chinese Communist Party:
<ul>
<li>The son of former Chinese President Hu Jintao, reportedly a personal friend of Zhao’s, held the position of Communist Party Secretary for the holding company that owned Unigroup.</li>
<li>The president of Tsinghua University during the 2000s was a former college roommate of Xi Jinping.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>2013:</strong> Zhao shifted focus to the chip industry, a move that coincided with the Chinese Communist Party’s announcement of major subsidies for domestic semiconductor companies.
<ul>
<li><strong>Zhao’s Claim:</strong> He denies that Tsinghua Unigroup’s semiconductor strategy was a reaction to the government’s plans, stating, “Everyone thinks that the government is pushing the development of the chip sector, but it’s not like that” (Forbes, 2015).</li>
<li><strong>Zhao’s Narrative:</strong> He presents himself as the driving force behind attracting Beijing’s attention to the sector: “Companies did some stuff first, and then the government started to notice, all our deals are market-oriented.”</li>

<li><strong>Micron’s Rejection:</strong> The company declined the offer, citing concerns about US government security reviews and deeming the deal unrealistic.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>September 2015: Another Failed Attempt:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tsinghua Unigroup offered $3.7 billion for a 15% stake in another US NAND memory chip company (name not specified in the text).</li>
<li><strong>CFIUS Rejection:</strong> The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews foreign investments for national security risks, blocked the deal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Spring 2016: Lattice Semiconductor Investment:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tsinghua Unigroup quietly acquired a 6% stake in Lattice Semiconductor, another US chip company.</li>
<li><strong>Zhao’s Claim:</strong> He insisted to the Wall Street Journal that this was “purely a financial investment,” adding, “We don’t have any intention at all to try to acquire Lattice.”</li>
<li><strong>Quick Sale:</strong> Within weeks, Tsinghua Unigroup began selling its Lattice shares.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Canyon Bridge and Imagination Technologies:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lattice Semiconductor Buyout Attempt:</strong> A California-based investment firm called Canyon Bridge, later revealed to be secretly funded by the Chinese government, made a bid to buy Lattice Semiconductor. This deal was also rejected by the US government.</li>
<li><strong>Imagination Technologies Acquisition:</strong> Canyon Bridge simultaneously purchased Imagination Technologies, a struggling UK-based chip designer. The deal was structured to exclude Imagination’s US assets to avoid US regulatory scrutiny.

<ul>
<li><strong>Ben Buchanan’s Triad of AI:</strong> Georgetown University’s Ben Buchanan identifies three key elements for AI development: data, algorithms, and computing power. While the U.S. currently leads in computing power, China is rapidly catching up in the other two areas.</li>
<li><strong>Data Access:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>China’s Argument:</strong> Proponents of China’s AI development point to the country’s vast surveillance state and massive population as advantages for data collection.</li>
<li><strong>Counterargument:</strong> The type of data collected through mass surveillance might not be as relevant for military AI applications.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Neither China nor the U.S. has a clear advantage in gathering militarily relevant data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Algorithm Development:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>China’s Strengths:</strong> China possesses a substantial pool of AI talent, with <strong>29%</strong> of the world’s leading AI researchers being from China, compared to <strong>20%</strong> from the U.S. and <strong>18%</strong> from Europe (Marco Polo think tank).</li>
<li><strong>US Strengths:</strong> The U.S. attracts and retains a significant portion of global AI talent, employing <strong>59%</strong> of the world’s top AI researchers.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Shift:</strong> Changes in U.S. visa policies, increased efforts by China to retain its researchers, and growing opportunities within China’s tech sector could erode America’s advantage in attracting top talent.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Computing Power:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Situation:</strong> While the U.S. maintains a lead in computing power, China’s dependence on foreign semiconductors, particularly U.S.-designed, Taiwan-manufactured processors, is a major vulnerability.
<ul>
<li>This dependence extends to data centers crucial for AI workloads.</li>
<li>A Chinese study estimates that <strong>95% of GPUs</strong> in Chinese servers running AI applications are NVIDIA-designed, highlighting reliance on U.S. technology.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>China’s Domestic Chip Production Efforts:</strong> While China is investing heavily in domestic chip production, experts predict it will be at least five years before they can design and several more before they can manufacture chips that rival the West.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>China’s Acquisition of U.S. Chips:</strong> Despite export controls, the PLA has managed to acquire U.S.-designed chips for military use.
<ul>
<li>A Georgetown University study analyzing 343 PLA procurement contracts for AI-related systems found that less than <strong>20%</strong> involved companies subject to U.S. export controls.</li>
<li>This indicates the effectiveness of China’s <strong>civil-military fusion</strong> policy, enabling the transfer of advanced civilian technology to military applications.</li>

<section id="challenges-to-chinas-technological-independence" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenges-to-chinas-technological-independence">Challenges to China’s Technological Independence</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multinational Supply Chains</strong>: Achieving complete technological independence in an industry with such complex and interconnected supply chains is incredibly difficult, even for the US.
<ul>
<li>China lacks competitive firms in key parts of the supply chain, including machinery and software, making independence even more challenging.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Replicating ASML’s EUV Machines</strong>:
<ul>
<li>EUV machines, crucial for producing advanced chips, took ASML almost three decades to develop and commercialize.</li>
<li>Replicating just the laser component requires assembling <strong>457,329 parts</strong> flawlessly.</li>
<li>Even with stolen design specs, the complexity of these machines cannot be easily replicated without decades of engineering experience and expertise.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>High Cost of Domestication</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Domesticating every aspect of the chip supply chain would be astronomically expensive.</li>
<li>The global chip industry spends over <strong>$100 billion</strong> annually on capital expenditures.</li>

<li><strong>Embracing RISC-V Architecture</strong>:
<ul>
<li>RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture, offering a free alternative to the dominant x86 (Intel, AMD) and ARM architectures.</li>
<li>Its open nature potentially reduces security risks, fosters faster innovation, and appeals to Chinese companies seeking geopolitical neutrality.</li>
<li>Alibaba is among the Chinese firms designing processors based on RISC-V.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Leveraging Older Process Technology</strong>:
<ul>
<li>While smartphones and data centers demand cutting-edge chips, other devices like cars can function on older, cheaper technology.</li>
<li>China is investing heavily in lagging-edge logic chip production, a segment less vulnerable to US export restrictions on older equipment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Investing in Emerging Materials</strong>:
<ul>
<li>China is focusing on silicon carbide and gallium nitride, materials with potential in electric vehicle power management systems.</li>
<li>Government subsidies in this area could give Chinese companies a competitive price advantage.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Growing Market Share</strong>:
<ul>
<li>China’s share of global chip fabrication is projected to rise from <strong>15%</strong> to <strong>24%</strong> by 2030, surpassing Taiwan and South Korea in volume, although potentially lagging behind technologically.</li>
<li>This increased market share could give China more leverage in demanding technology transfer and make it costlier for the US to impose export restrictions.</li>

<ul>
<li>Following the poorly attended Senate briefing, Brose and Senator McCain engaged in a sobering thought experiment: imagining a potential war with China.
<ul>
<li>They agreed that the U.S. would not instigate a conflict, but acknowledged potential triggers such as:
<ul>
<li>A maritime incident escalating into conflict.</li>
<li>A Chinese attack on a U.S. ally prompting American intervention.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>They envisioned a scenario where the U.S. would face significant challenges in mobilizing and deploying forces.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-potential-war-with-china-key-vulnerabilities-and-challenges">A Potential War With China: Key Vulnerabilities and Challenges</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geographical Disadvantages and Logistical Nightmares:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Much of the U.S. military’s necessary equipment and personnel would be positioned thousands of miles away from the conflict zone.</li>
<li>Mobilization efforts would be hampered by cyberattacks and attacks on vulnerable supply lines, including cargo ships and aircraft.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Space and Cyber Warfare Dominance by China:</strong>
<ul>
<li>China would leverage its capabilities to target U.S. satellites, disrupting critical intelligence, communication, and GPS systems.</li>
<li>Command and control networks would be crippled by electronic, cyber, and missile attacks, leaving U.S. forces in disarray.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability of Forward Bases and Critical Infrastructure:</strong>
<ul>
<li>U.S. bases in Japan and Guam would be overwhelmed by barrages of Chinese ballistic and cruise missiles.</li>
<li>China’s hypersonic weapons, capable of maneuvering at high speeds, would render existing U.S. defenses useless.</li>
<li>Runways, operation centers, and fuel depots would be targeted, crippling U.S. operations and forcing evacuations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Air and Sea Power:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Older, non-stealthy fighter jets (F-15s, F-16s, F-18s) would be ineffective against China’s advanced air defenses.</li>
<li>Limited numbers of stealthy fighter jets (F-22s, F-35s) would be hampered by their short range and dependence on vulnerable aerial refueling tankers.</li>
<li>U.S. aircraft carriers would be forced to operate far from Chinese shores to avoid anti-ship missiles, limiting their effectiveness and making them vulnerable to attack.</li>
<li>China’s “carrier killer” missiles (DF-21 and DF-26) would pose a significant threat, potentially sinking carriers and causing massive casualties.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenges for the Marine Corps and Amphibious Operations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Marine Corps’ amphibious assault capabilities, designed for beach landings, would be largely ineffective against heavily defended Chinese territory.</li>
<li>The need to operate within range of Chinese missiles would severely restrict their ability to conduct traditional amphibious operations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Logistical Constraints and Depletion of Critical Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Key U.S. assets (submarines, long-range bombers, ground-launched missiles) would need to be relocated to the Pacific, taking crucial time.</li>
<li>Years of underinvestment and acquisition delays would result in a shortage of these assets and a rapid depletion of essential weapons.</li>

<ul>
<li>McCain expressed frustration and disappointment that despite past warnings and efforts to address military weaknesses, the U.S. found itself in a precarious position.
<ul>
<li>The 1980s revelation of a “hollow force” sparked outrage and action, yet the current crisis, despite being more dire, had not elicited a similar response.</li>

<ul>
<li>Despite spending more on defense than any other country, the U.S. military faces an existential crisis, challenging the prevailing notion of its invincibility.
<ul>
<li>This discrepancy between spending and effectiveness highlights a fundamental flaw in how the U.S. approaches national defense.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Problem with Platforms:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. military’s traditional focus on platforms (e.g., ships, planes, tanks) as the primary measure of strength is misguided.</li>
<li>Platforms are seen as tangible symbols of military might, influencing budgets, capabilities, and even institutional identity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Importance of the Kill Chain:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defining the Kill Chain:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The kill chain is the essential process by which militaries achieve their objectives, involving three key steps:
<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding:</strong> Gathering information about the battlespace and the enemy.</li>
<li><strong>Deciding:</strong> Analyzing information and making strategic and tactical decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Acting:</strong> Executing decisions to achieve desired effects, which may or may not involve lethal force.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Closing and Breaking the Kill Chain:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Closing the Kill Chain:</strong> Successfully completing the understand-decide-act cycle to achieve a military objective.</li>
<li><strong>Breaking the Kill Chain:</strong> Disrupting an adversary’s ability to complete the kill chain, neutralizing their effectiveness.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>A Universal Concept:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The kill chain is not unique to the military; it mirrors processes used in business, sports, and everyday life.</li>
<li>This framework highlights that while the military operates in a unique and high-stakes environment, its core functions are relatable and understandable.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Information Revolution and Its Unfulfilled Promise:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The information revolution of the 1980s promised to revolutionize warfare by enabling networked warfare and the disaggregation of the kill chain across multiple platforms.</li>
<li>However, the U.S. defense establishment failed to fully embrace this transformation, clinging to its platform-centric approach.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Failure to Adapt:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Despite advancements in information technology, the U.S. military’s kill chain remains slow, inflexible, and reliant on outdated systems.</li>
<li>Military platforms often lack interoperability, hindering their ability to share information and function as a cohesive network.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Legacy of Failed Modernization:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Previous attempts to modernize the military often focused on developing better versions of existing platforms using unproven technologies, resulting in costly procurement failures.</li>
<li>The U.S. military’s current predicament is partly a result of learning the wrong lessons from these failures, leading to risk aversion and a reluctance to embrace truly transformative change.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Rapidly Evolving Threat:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The information revolution is accelerating, driven by commercial technology companies, and these advancements have significant military applications.</li>
<li>China, capitalizing on these emerging technologies, poses a rapidly growing and evolving threat to U.S. military dominance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>China’s Strategic Approach:</strong>
<ul>
<li>China has meticulously studied the U.S. military, identifying its weaknesses and developing strategies to exploit them.</li>
<li>Instead of directly confronting U.S. strengths, China aims to deny the U.S. military the ability to project power and fight in its preferred manner.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Asymmetric Warfare and Technological Leapfrogging:</strong>
<ul>
<li>China has invested heavily in advanced weapons designed to disrupt U.S. battle networks, destroy expensive platforms, and break the kill chain.</li>
<li>This approach prioritizes achieving a decisive advantage through technological superiority and asymmetric capabilities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Rise of China: Economic and Military Power:</strong>
<ul>
<li>China’s economic growth fuels its military ambitions, potentially enabling it to match or surpass U.S. military spending within a decade.</li>
<li>This shift in the balance of power poses an unprecedented challenge, demanding a fundamental reassessment of U.S. defense strategy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>China’s Grand Strategy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>China’s ambitions extend beyond regional dominance to becoming the world’s leading power, supplanting the United States.</li>
<li>This strategy entails undermining U.S. influence globally, eroding its alliances, and promoting China’s model of authoritarianism.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exploiting Emerging Technologies:</strong>
<ul>
<li>China recognizes the transformative potential of emerging technologies and is investing heavily in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, robotics, and other fields.</li>
<li>These technologies are not only being used to enhance its military but also to strengthen its authoritarian control domestically.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>A Looming Crisis for the U.S. Military:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. military’s current trajectory puts it at a severe disadvantage against China’s asymmetric capabilities.</li>
<li>Continuing to invest in the same platforms and approaches will only exacerbate this vulnerability, playing into China’s hands.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Recognizing the Urgency:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. defense establishment must acknowledge the severity of the situation and the need for radical change.</li>
<li>Complacency and clinging to outdated paradigms will result in catastrophic consequences for U.S. security and global standing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shifting from Inputs to Outcomes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The focus should shift from simply acquiring platforms to building a more effective kill chain.</li>
<li>This requires prioritizing technologies and capabilities that enhance the U.S. military’s ability to understand, decide, and act faster and more effectively than its competitors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>From Platforms to Networks:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Instead of relying on small numbers of expensive and vulnerable platforms, the U.S. military must adopt a more networked and distributed approach.</li>
<li>This entails investing in:
<ul>
<li><strong>Interoperable Systems:</strong> Enabling seamless communication and data sharing between platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Resilient Networks:</strong> Developing robust networks that can withstand attacks and disruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> Leveraging AI for faster and more effective decision-making.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>From Offensive to Defensive:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. military must prioritize defensive capabilities that deter Chinese aggression and protect critical assets.</li>
<li>This includes:
<ul>
<li>Strengthening base defenses against missile attacks.</li>
<li>Developing more effective counter-space and cyber capabilities.</li>
<li>Investing in technologies that make U.S. platforms less vulnerable to detection and attack.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Embracing Autonomy and Unmanned Systems:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. military should accelerate the development and deployment of autonomous and unmanned systems.</li>
<li>This shift would:
<ul>
<li>Reduce reliance on vulnerable manned platforms.</li>
<li>Increase the speed and tempo of operations.</li>
<li>Enable the U.S. military to operate more effectively in contested environments.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rethinking Force Structure:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. military must move away from its traditional force structure of large, heavily manned platforms.</li>
<li>Instead, it should prioritize:
<ul>
<li>Smaller, more agile, and expendable platforms.</li>
<li>A greater emphasis on unmanned and autonomous systems.</li>
<li>A force that is designed for distributed and networked warfare.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Overcoming Institutional Inertia:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The biggest obstacle to transformation is not a lack of resources or technology but a lack of imagination and institutional inertia.</li>
<li>Overcoming this will require:
<ul>
<li>Strong leadership willing to challenge the status quo.</li>
<li>A cultural shift that embraces innovation and change.</li>
<li>A willingness to take risks and accept that failure is part of the innovation process.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-visionarys-warning-andrew-marshall-and-the-future-of-war">A Visionary’s Warning: Andrew Marshall and the Future of War</h4>
<ul>
<li>In 1991, amidst the backdrop of the Cold War’s end, Andrew Marshall, director of the Office of Net Assessment (ONA), initiated a project to assess the future of warfare.
<ul>
<li><strong>Andrew Marshall</strong>, often referred to as “Yoda,” held this influential position for 42 years, reporting directly to the Secretary of Defense.</li>
<li>The ONA’s primary mission was to evaluate the United States’ strategic standing against its competitors, mainly the Soviet Union.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Marshall, aided by Army Colonel Andrew Krepenevich, aimed to analyze the impact of emerging technologies and the Soviet Union’s collapse on international security and the U.S.’s role.</li>
<li>This project became particularly relevant after the U.S. waged war against Iraq in response to the invasion of Kuwait, a conflict heavily shaped by Cold War strategies and military structures.</li>
</ul>

<section id="the-gulf-war-illusion-a-misleading-victory" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-gulf-war-illusion-a-misleading-victory">The Gulf War Illusion: A Misleading Victory</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Gulf War (1991) unfolded as a demonstration of American military might, leaving a lasting impression on a young generation.
<ul>
<li>The conflict showcased technological advancements like stealth bombers, smart bombs, and superior air and ground power.</li>
<li>The U.S. achieved a swift victory with minimal casualties (129 combat deaths).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite the perceived success, Marshall’s 1992 report to the Secretary of Defense offered a different perspective.
<ul>
<li>He highlighted the influence of classified Soviet military writings that predicted a “<strong>military technical revolution</strong>.”
<ul>
<li>This revolution, termed the “<strong>reconnaissance strike complex,</strong>” proposed that advanced sensors and surveillance technologies, coupled with precision weaponry, would create the fastest, most effective kill chain in history.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While the Soviets saw the Gulf War as a testament to this concept, Marshall argued that the U.S. hadn’t even come close to achieving its full potential in this area.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A 1993 Pentagon study supported Marshall’s assessment.
<ul>
<li>The study revealed that the U.S. battle network remained largely unchanged since the Vietnam era.</li>
<li>It struggled to engage moving targets and relied heavily on “dumb bombs” instead of “smart” ones.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Admiral William Owens, future Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, later stated that the Gulf War was primarily won through “massed brute force,” akin to historical campaigns.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-revolution-in-military-affairs-the-need-for-transformation">A Revolution in Military Affairs: The Need for Transformation</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Marshall envisioned a <strong>revolution in military affairs (RMA),</strong> driven by information technologies.</p>
<ul>
<li>He cited historical examples of RMAs, such as the introduction of machine guns, steam-powered ships, and airplanes, emphasizing that technological advancements alone were insufficient.</li>
<li>Successful RMAs required developing new operational strategies and reforming existing military institutions for new strategic goals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Marshall warned that the U.S. was in the early stages of such a revolution, one that could last for decades.</p>
<ul>
<li>This RMA would center around information technologies that enhance understanding, decision-making, and action in war.</li>
<li>It would necessitate a shift in the concept of military power, potentially rendering traditional platforms like tanks, manned aircraft, and large ships less effective.</li>
<li>Marshall cautioned that failure to adapt to this RMA would leave the U.S. vulnerable to adversaries who successfully harnessed its potential.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Marshall’s analysts coined the term “<strong>anti-access and area denial capabilities</strong>” to describe how powerful adversaries could leverage this RMA to counter the U.S.’s platform-centric approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Despite its prescience, Marshall’s report failed to instigate significant change.</p>
<ul>
<li>The U.S., after the Soviet Union’s collapse, found itself in a unipolar world, with no immediate peer competitors.</li>
<li>This led to a sense of complacency, with leaders prioritizing a “peace dividend” by downsizing the military and focusing on peacekeeping and humanitarian missions.</li>
<li>The prevailing assumption was that future conflicts would resemble the Gulf War, fought against technologically inferior adversaries, allowing the U.S. to dictate the terms of engagement.</li>

<ul>
<li>Despite the lack of substantial change, the concept of RMA gained traction in Washington during the 1990s, driven by the fascination with the burgeoning information age.
<ul>
<li>“Revolution” and “transformation” became buzzwords, leading to numerous initiatives aimed at reimagining the U.S. military.
<ul>
<li>These initiatives included projects like “Army After Next,” “Network-Centric Warfare,” “Joint Vision 2010,” and “Lifting the Fog of War.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review, the Pentagon’s key strategy document, explicitly prioritized exploiting the RMA.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, despite the rhetoric and investments in defense technology, the U.S.’s way of fighting remained largely unchanged.
<ul>
<li>The interventions in Bosnia (1995) and Kosovo (1999) further reinforced this complacency.
<ul>
<li>These conflicts, won with minimal U.S. casualties (four non-combat deaths), were attributed more to adversary weakness than any significant U.S. transformation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Admiral Owens, after retiring, criticized the military’s “residual overconfidence” and its tendency to draw the wrong lessons from the Gulf War.

<li><p>As the 21st century began, Marshall, recognizing the lack of progress, initiated the “<strong>Future Warfare 20XX war game series</strong>.”</p>
<ul>
<li>These war games aimed to simulate future conflicts in a world where the RMA had reached maturity, pitting the U.S. against a hypothetical “large peer competitor” – implicitly China.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The war games were led by Robert Martinage and Michael Vickers, both future senior Pentagon officials.</p></li>
<li><p>Their 2001 report presented a stark assessment:</p>
<ul>
<li>China, by 2025-2030, would possess advanced technologies comparable to the U.S., enabling it to target U.S. assets globally, including the homeland.</li>
<li>The U.S.’s reliance on traditional platforms and its vulnerability to attacks on its communication and logistics networks would render its traditional way of fighting ineffective.</li>
<li>The report stressed the need to fully embrace the RMA, building technologically advanced, networked forces, especially unmanned systems, to counter these threats.</li>
<li>The report warned of an “unforgiving future battlefield” where “if you can be seen, you can be killed.”</li>

<ul>
<li>The arrival of Donald Rumsfeld as Secretary of Defense in 2001 initially signaled potential progress.
<ul>
<li>Rumsfeld openly advocated for the RMA and created the Office of Force Transformation to oversee the development of new military technologies and doctrines.</li>
<li>He also signed a new defense strategy that prioritized addressing the operational challenges highlighted in Marshall’s 20XX war games, shifting focus toward emerging great powers like China.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, the 9/11 terrorist attacks drastically altered the strategic landscape, leading to a significant shift in priorities.
<ul>
<li>While Rumsfeld still emphasized transformation, the focus shifted towards waging a global war on terror.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The War on Terror did yield some genuine military innovations, primarily within the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC).
<ul>
<li>JSOC developed new technologies and tactics for counterterrorism missions, achieving remarkable speed and effectiveness in dismantling terrorist networks.</li>
<li>This innovation, along with the adoption of a counterinsurgency strategy in 2007, played a crucial role in weakening al-Qaeda in Iraq.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, the War on Terror ultimately sidetracked the U.S. from addressing the long-term challenge posed by China.
<ul>
<li>While the Bush administration claimed that both priorities could be managed simultaneously, the focus on counterterrorism, particularly the protracted conflict in Iraq, consumed the majority of resources and attention.</li>

<ul>
<li>Despite claims of transformation, the initial victories in Afghanistan and Iraq were, in essence, repetitions of past successes, achieved against significantly weaker opponents.
<ul>
<li>The U.S. retained its ability to dictate the terms of engagement, operate from secure sanctuaries, and leverage its technological superiority.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The core issue remained unchanged: the lack of urgency to embrace genuine transformation.
<ul>
<li>The perceived ease of these victories reinforced the belief in the U.S.’s military dominance and the validity of its traditional approaches to warfare.</li>
<li>Even as the Iraq War deteriorated into a strategic quagmire, the defense establishment largely dismissed it as an anomaly, clinging to outdated assumptions.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-real-cost-of-war-neglecting-the-future">The Real Cost of War: Neglecting the Future</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>A prevailing narrative within the defense establishment argues that the U.S. military’s lack of preparedness for future challenges stems from the overwhelming demands of the War on Terror, which consumed its budget and bandwidth.</p>
<ul>
<li>While the constant operational tempo undoubtedly took a toll, this narrative only tells part of the story.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The root cause lies in a failure of imagination and a misallocation of resources.</p>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. clung to the idea that a persistent global military presence, rather than investing in and showcasing innovative capabilities, would deter adversaries.</li>
<li>This strategy, however, led to the overextension and exhaustion of the military, with limited strategic gains.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Instead of prioritizing the development of faster, more adaptable kill chains through real-world experimentation, the U.S. poured vast sums into attempting to transform existing platforms, often with little success.</p></li>
<li><p>Billions were wasted on numerous modernization programs that were ultimately canceled without yielding any usable capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Examples include the Army’s Future Combat System ($18.1 billion), the Marine Corps’ Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle ($3.3 billion), and a host of other projects across all services.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Even those programs that weren’t canceled often faced significant delays, cost overruns, and ultimately failed to deliver the promised “transformational” capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>This includes high-profile programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Ford-class aircraft carrier, the KC-46 refueling tanker, and the Littoral Combat Ship, as well as numerous lesser-known systems.</li>
<li>Many of these systems were rushed into development before the underlying technologies were mature, leading to persistent problems and escalating costs.</li>

<ul>
<li>One of the most glaring failures was the lack of interoperability between different military systems, despite the emphasis on information sharing and joint operations.
<ul>
<li>Systems were often designed with incompatible communication and data-sharing protocols, hindering their ability to function as a cohesive network.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A prime example is the inability of the F-22 and F-35A fighter jets, both Air Force programs built by the same company, to directly share basic targeting data.
<ul>
<li>This lack of seamless integration forced reliance on outdated communication methods, such as voice transmissions.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>While some genuinely revolutionary technologies were explored, they often faced resistance and were ultimately sidelined or abandoned.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) made progress in areas like artificial intelligence, but these projects rarely transitioned into operational capabilities.</li>
<li>Other initiatives, such as the development of semi-autonomous long-range anti-ship missiles and unmanned combat air vehicles, struggled for funding and were eventually discontinued.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Navy’s X-47, the first unmanned aerial vehicle capable of launching from and landing on an aircraft carrier, demonstrated remarkable technological prowess but was canceled despite its success.</p></li>
<li><p>This resistance to innovation stemmed from the prioritization of traditional platforms, particularly manned aircraft, which were seen as central to the identity and budget justifications of the military services.</p>

<ul>
<li>This approach ignored Marshall’s warnings that these legacy systems would become increasingly vulnerable in a future characterized by advanced reconnaissance strike complexes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The result was a collection of disparate sensors and weapons systems, lacking seamless interoperability and requiring significant time and effort to function cohesively.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>As the conflict dragged on, revealing critical equipment shortages (body armor, blast-resistant vehicles, and unmanned surveillance aircraft) and mounting casualties, the idea of technological transformation became associated with a failure to adequately equip and support troops in the present.</li>

<ul>
<li>By 2008, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates criticized what he termed “next-war-itis,” arguing against prioritizing future needs over current demands.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In reality, the more pervasive affliction was “last-war-itis” – an overreliance on past successes and a reluctance to adapt to a changing strategic environment.</p></li>

<li>While President Obama campaigned on ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, his tenure saw a continuation of these conflicts and the expansion of military operations into Libya, Yemen, Syria, and elsewhere.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Although Obama called for a “pivot to Asia” to counter China’s rise, and his administration initiated the “Air-Sea Battle” concept to address China’s growing military capabilities in the western Pacific, these efforts were undermined by budgetary constraints.</p></li>
<li><p>The 2011 Budget Control Act, enacted to reduce federal spending, mandated $1 trillion in defense cuts over a decade, triggering a scramble for resources within the defense establishment.</p>
<ul>
<li>This resulted in a prioritization of short-term needs and legacy programs over long-term modernization and innovation.</li>
<li>The military continued to receive more missions but not the resources to effectively execute them or prepare for future challenges.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>On February 27, 2014, <strong>“little green men,”</strong> masked soldiers in unmarked green uniforms, began seizing control of strategic locations in Crimea, Ukraine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Speculation immediately arose that these were Russian special forces, a notion initially downplayed by U.S. officials.</li>
<li>This event caught the U.S. government off guard, despite indications of Russian military movements into Crimea.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The “little green men” swiftly took control of Crimea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seizing control of key infrastructure.</li>
<li>Blockading Ukrainian military forces.</li>
<li>Sealing off the peninsula from the rest of Ukraine.</li>
<li>Forcing the evacuation of 25,000 Ukrainian troops.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On March 21, 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, marking the first violent change of an international border in Europe since World War II.</p></li>
<li><p>The “little green men” employed advanced military tactics and technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incited and supported Russian-speaking separatist groups.</li>
<li>Utilized sophisticated Russian military systems, including electronic warfare, communications jammers, air defenses, and long-range precision rocket artillery.
<ul>
<li>Much of this technology surpassed the capabilities of the U.S. military.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Examples of Russian military superiority as recounted by Ukrainian commanders:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jamming Ukrainian drones, causing them to crash.</li>
<li>Jamming the fuses on Ukrainian warheads, rendering them inert.</li>
<li>Detecting Ukrainian communications signals and using them to target attacks.</li>
<li>Deploying unmanned spotter drones to identify and target armored vehicles.</li>
<li>Using thermobaric warheads to eliminate Ukrainian troops in bunkers and trenches.</li>
<li>Annihilating Ukrainian troop columns with cluster munitions.</li>
<li><strong>Targeted assassination:</strong> Using intercepted cell phone data to geolocate and eliminate a Ukrainian commander.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Russia’s Actions in Ukraine Demonstrated:</strong></p>

<li>Violation of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty with the deployment of ground-launched cruise missiles capable of reaching Europe.</li>
<li>Snap military movements near NATO borders, raising concerns about potential aggression.</li>
<li>Threats of nuclear escalation to deter U.S. intervention.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Analysis of Russia’s Military Capabilities:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In 2016, RAND Corporation analysts David Shlapek and Michael Johnson predicted that Russian forces could reach the capitals of all three Baltic states within 60 hours, overwhelming NATO defenses.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="eisenhowers-approach-picking-winners">Eisenhower’s Approach: Picking Winners</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>President Eisenhower’s Philosophy:</strong> Concentrate resources and empower exceptional individuals (“<strong>founders</strong>”) to develop critical military technologies.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> General Bernard Schriever and the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).
<ul>
<li>Schriever was given broad authority, ample funding, and protection from bureaucratic interference.</li>
<li>His team successfully developed ICBMs, laying the groundwork for space exploration, in just five years.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Other “Founders” and their Achievements:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edward Teller:</strong> Developed the hydrogen bomb.</li>
<li><strong>Admiral Hyman Rickover:</strong> Developed miniaturized nuclear reactors for submarines.</li>
<li><strong>Kelly Johnson:</strong> Developed advanced aircraft, including the SR-71 Blackbird.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Prioritizing Speed and Results:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Efficiency and cost-effectiveness were secondary to rapid development and fielding of advanced weapons.</li>
<li>This approach was accepted as the price of staying ahead in the Cold War.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Silicon Valley’s Origins:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Defense contracts during and after World War II transformed Silicon Valley from an agricultural region into a hub of electronics and technology innovation.</li>
<li>This military funding fueled the development of technologies like mainframes, microprocessors, and the internet.</li>
<li>Early Silicon Valley embraced working on military technologies, driven by the challenges and the belief in contributing to national security.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nvidia-and-the-power-of-edge-computing">NVIDIA and the Power of Edge Computing</h4>
<ul>
<li>In 2018, executives from NVIDIA, a computing company, visited the Senate to discuss their partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory.</li>
<li>They had built the world’s fastest supercomputer, capable of performing 200 quadrillion operations per second using NVIDIA’s <strong>graphics processing units (GPUs)</strong>.
<ul>
<li><strong>GPUs</strong> were originally designed for video games, which demanded increasingly powerful computing capabilities.</li>
<li>NVIDIA realized that the same technology powering artificial worlds in games could also power intelligent machines in the real world, particularly in <strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NVIDIA’s GPUs are now crucial for self-driving vehicles.
<ul>
<li>Their Drive AGX Pegasus chip, the size of a textbook, can conduct 320 trillion operations per second, enabling real-time data processing and interpretation on board the vehicle – a concept known as <strong>edge computing</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite the military applications of their technology, NVIDIA had no GPUs operating on fielded U.S. military systems at the time.
<ul>
<li>This highlights a significant technological gap between the U.S. military and commercial technology companies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The most capable computer in a U.S. military system at the time was in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, nicknamed the “Flying Supercomputer.”
<ul>
<li>It could perform 400 billion operations per second, significantly less than NVIDIA’s Drive AGX Pegasus.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-new-global-arms-race-beyond-conventional-weapons">A New Global Arms Race: Beyond Conventional Weapons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Representatives from over 80 countries have been discussing a ban on <strong>lethal autonomous weapons</strong> since 2014.
<ul>
<li><strong>Lethal autonomous weapons:</strong> Defined by the Department of Defense as machines activated to select and engage targets without human intervention.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These weapons, often called “<strong>killer robots</strong>” by opponents, raise ethical concerns about removing humans from the kill chain.
<ul>
<li><strong>Kill chain:</strong> The process of identifying, targeting, and engaging an enemy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While China supports banning the <em>use</em> of these weapons, it has not committed to halting their <em>development</em>.
<ul>
<li>China’s definition of lethal autonomous weapons is narrow and does not encompass the full range of systems it’s developing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This discrepancy highlights a broader trend of rapidly developing military technologies, sparking fears of a global arms race encompassing:
<ul>
<li>Cyber weapons</li>
<li>AI</li>
<li>Hypersonic technology</li>
<li>5G networks</li>
<li>Quantum computing</li>
<li>Gene editing</li>
<li>Space capabilities</li>
</ul></li>
<li>China’s role in this arms race is particularly concerning due to:
<ul>
<li>Significant economic and military power</li>
<li>Less transparent intentions compared to other nations</li>
<li>A potential ambition to reshape the world order in favor of its illiberal values, including authoritarianism, crony capitalism, and surveillance states.</li>
<li>The perception of the United States as an obstacle to its ambitions.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-ethical-dilemma-of-intelligent-machines-in-war">The Ethical Dilemma of Intelligent Machines in War</h3>
<ul>
<li>The author recounts a poignant encounter with a Syrian mother who lost all five of her children in a barrel bomb attack, an experience that deeply affected both him and the late Senator John McCain.
<ul>
<li>This encounter underscores the profound human cost of war and serves as a stark reminder of the ethical considerations surrounding the use of force.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author grapples with the question of whether, as a potential civilian caught in a conflict, the knowledge of whether the weapon systems targeting him were operated by humans or machines would matter.
<ul>
<li>This question highlights a fundamental debate about the ethics of war in the age of intelligent machines:
<ul>
<li><strong>Is the morality of an action determined by the nature of the actor, or by the consequences of the action itself?</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author argues that the current debate about intelligent machines in war often misses the mark by focusing on the wrong questions.
<ul>
<li>He suggests that instead of fixating on the means of warfare (e.g., “killer robots”), we should prioritize the ends (i.e., the ethical use of force) and the principles of human accountability that should govern them.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-importance-of-command-and-control">The Importance of Command and Control</h3>
<ul>
<li>The author criticizes the term “human-machine teaming” often used to describe the relationship between humans and intelligent machines in a military context.
<ul>
<li>He argues that this term implies a false equivalence between human operators and machines.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Instead, the author advocates for the concept of <strong>“human command and machine control,”</strong> emphasizing the hierarchical nature of the relationship where humans retain ultimate authority and responsibility.
<ul>
<li>This concept aligns with the long-standing military principles of command and control, ensuring that human judgment and ethics remain central to the use of force.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author acknowledges the concerns surrounding the potential for machines to act unethically.
<ul>
<li>However, he argues that humans have always exhibited a capacity for cruelty and that focusing solely on the perceived inhumanity of machines ignores the historical reality of human fallibility in war.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author emphasizes that the current debate should center around <strong>narrow artificial intelligence</strong> (AI), which is limited to performing specific tasks, rather than <strong>artificial general intelligence (AGI)</strong> or <strong>superintelligence</strong>, which remain speculative concepts.
<ul>
<li>He underscores that narrow AI, despite its capabilities, operates within the boundaries defined by its human creators.</li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Autonomy</strong> in the context of machines, the author clarifies, does not imply independent decision-making but rather the delegation of tasks within predefined parameters set by humans.</p>
<ul>
<li>This concept mirrors the existing military practice of granting autonomy to human subordinates, albeit with clear rules of engagement and accountability mechanisms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The author proposes a framework for building trust in intelligent machines, drawing parallels to the trust established between human commanders and their subordinates. This framework rests on three pillars:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Training:</strong> Rigorous training of machines to perform designated tasks effectively and ethically.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Testing:</strong> Repeated testing to ensure the machine’s reliability, predictability, and adherence to established parameters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trust:</strong> Trust is earned through consistent demonstration of competence and reliability in training and testing, leading to greater confidence in the machine’s ability to perform as intended.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The author underscores that accountability remains paramount. Just as commanders are responsible for the actions of their human subordinates, they would bear the responsibility for the actions of the machines under their command.</p>
<ul>
<li>This accountability extends to the entire chain of command, including those involved in training, testing, and deploying the intelligent machines.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="differentiating-roles-leveraging-human-judgment">Differentiating Roles: Leveraging Human Judgment</h3>
<ul>
<li>The author argues that one of the potential benefits of increased reliance on intelligent machines is the opportunity to free human operators from mundane and repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on more complex and ethically demanding aspects of warfare.
<ul>
<li>This shift could lead to a more ethical use of force by allowing humans to leverage their unique capacity for judgment, empathy, and moral reasoning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author acknowledges that current intelligent machines might outperform humans in certain tasks, particularly those requiring speed, accuracy, and consistency in data analysis and pattern recognition.
<ul>
<li>However, he stresses that machines should not be seen as replacements for human judgment in all instances.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author contends that while machines can enhance human decision-making by providing valuable insights and recommendations, the ultimate responsibility for decisions, especially those involving the use of lethal force, must remain with human commanders.
<ul>
<li>This approach ensures that human values and ethical considerations remain at the forefront of warfare.</li>

<section id="legal-and-ethical-considerations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="legal-and-ethical-considerations">Legal and Ethical Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The author argues that contrary to popular narratives, lethal autonomous weapons systems are not inherently illegal. He outlines the established legal criteria for determining the legality of a weapon:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Discrimination:</strong> The weapon should be capable of distinguishing between combatants and civilians.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proportionality:</strong> The use of the weapon should be proportionate to the military objective, minimizing unnecessary civilian harm.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Controllability:</strong> The effects of the weapon should be controllable, preventing unintended and widespread harm.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The author emphasizes that the legality of a weapon hinges on its inherent design and intended effects, not on the autonomy of the actor deploying it.</p>
<ul>
<li>He suggests that focusing solely on the “autonomy” of a weapon system misses the critical point that even autonomous weapons operate within the parameters defined by their human creators.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The author acknowledges the potential for errors and unintended consequences, even with highly intelligent machines.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="jan-blochs-predictions-and-their-implications-today">Jan Bloch’s Predictions and Their Implications Today</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jan Bloch</strong>, a Polish banker and military scholar, published a book in 1898 predicting how technology would transform warfare.
<ul>
<li>He accurately foresaw the lethality of modern battlefields due to technological advancements like:
<ul>
<li><strong>Machine guns</strong></li>
<li><strong>Smokeless gunpowder:</strong> This innovation would “lift the fog of war,” leaving armies exposed after initial volleys.</li>
<li><strong>Long-range artillery:</strong> Bloch calculated these were 116 times deadlier than those used a few decades prior.</li>
<li><strong>Improved rifles:</strong> Offering greater speed, accuracy, and range.</li>
<li>Other innovations: Including <strong>railroads, telegraphs, and steamships</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bloch believed this increase in lethality would make large-scale wars “impossible.”</li>
<li>However, World War I proved him wrong, though the conflict unfolded largely as he predicted, with trench warfare and high casualties (40 million deaths in four years).</li>

<li>For the first time since the 19th century, the U.S. faces a credible threat of conventional military attack on its homeland.
<ul>
<li>China’s development of long-range precision strike capabilities has made U.S. territory vulnerable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This new reality necessitates a significant shift in U.S. defense posture, requiring investments in homeland defense and a reevaluation of the military’s role in protecting the U.S. from conventional attack.</li>

<ul>
<li>The author calls for a shift from an offensive to a defensive mindset, adapting to the challenges posed by China’s military capabilities.</li>
<li>This new approach emphasizes:
<ul>
<li><strong>Denial:</strong> Preventing adversaries from achieving their objectives by making it too costly or difficult.</li>
<li><strong>Deterrence:</strong> Dissuading adversaries from taking aggressive actions by demonstrating the ability and willingness to inflict unacceptable costs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This shift requires a move away from the traditional U.S. military model of power projection and dominance towards a more agile and resilient force structure.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-need-for-change-in-u.s.-defense">The Need for Change in U.S. Defense</h3>
<p>This chapter argues that the U.S. defense establishment needs significant change to adapt to future challenges. The author uses the case study of the JSTARS program and draws parallels to historical examples like the adoption of aircraft carriers and ICBMs to illustrate the need for a new approach. The chapter focuses on two key elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incentives:</strong> Rewarding innovation, agility, and the development of technologies that address future threats.</li>
<li><strong>Imagination:</strong> Moving beyond traditional platforms and doctrines to embrace new ways of warfare and leverage emerging technologies.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="case-study-the-jstars-program" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="case-study-the-jstars-program">Case Study: The JSTARS Program</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Problem:</strong> The Air Force’s plan to replace the aging JSTARS aircraft, a vital intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platform, with a new version of the same aircraft.
<ul>
<li>This plan was flawed because the new JSTARS would be vulnerable to attacks from advanced adversaries like China and Russia.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Solution:</strong> The Air Force proposed disaggregating JSTARS’s capabilities, distributing them across a network of unmanned aircraft and satellites. This approach offered greater resilience and survivability.</li>
<li><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Powerful members of Congress and defense contractors who stood to benefit from the continued production of the traditional JSTARS aircraft opposed the Air Force’s plan.</li>
<li><strong>The Success:</strong> The Air Force’s success in shifting to the new program stemmed from several factors:
<ul>
<li><strong>Political Strategy:</strong> Early and candid engagement with key stakeholders in Congress.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Providing detailed information about the threat to JSTARS and the advantages of the new program.</li>
<li><strong>Industry Engagement:</strong> Informing defense companies about the new plan, enabling them to lobby Congress.</li>
<li><strong>Compromise:</strong> Basing elements of the future program in the same state that would have hosted JSTARS, securing support from potential opponents.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Even good ideas require political maneuvering and strategic compromise to succeed within the existing defense system.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="obstacles-to-change-and-reasons-for-hope">Obstacles to Change and Reasons for Hope</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Obstacles:</strong> The U.S. defense establishment faces significant obstacles to change, including:
<ul>
<li><strong>Parochial Military Services:</strong> Prioritizing their own interests over joint solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Interested Companies:</strong> Focusing on profits and protecting existing programs.</li>
<li><strong>Distracted Political Leaders:</strong> Lacking focus on long-term defense planning and more concerned with short-term political gains.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reasons for Hope:</strong> Despite these obstacles, the United States possesses key elements for successful adaptation:
<ul>
<li><strong>Financial Resources:</strong> Ample funding for defense.</li>
<li><strong>Technological Leadership:</strong> Access to cutting-edge technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Skilled Workforce:</strong> A talented pool of engineers and innovators.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Core Issue:</strong> The main obstacle lies in Washington, D.C., and stems from:
<ul>
<li><strong>Dysfunctional Political System:</strong> Hampering the ability to make tough but necessary decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Vision:</strong> A failure to envision and implement necessary defense reforms.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="restructuring-incentives-for-a-future-ready-military">Restructuring Incentives for a Future-Ready Military</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Imperative:</strong> To prepare for future threats, the U.S. must restructure its defense incentives to favor:
<ul>
<li><strong>Networked Kill Chains:</strong> Over legacy platforms.</li>
<li><strong>New Ways of War:</strong> Over familiar doctrines.</li>
<li><strong>Defense:</strong> Over offense.</li>
<li><strong>Future Needs:</strong> Over present requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Software:</strong> Over hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid Capability Development:</strong> Over acquisition compliance and cost accounting.</li>
<li><strong>Technological Diversity:</strong> Over reliance on traditional defense contractors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Mechanism:</strong> Achieving this shift necessitates:
<ul>
<li><strong>Leadership Ownership:</strong> Senior leaders in the Department of Defense and Congress must champion and drive change.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> A partnership between the Pentagon and Congress to establish shared expectations and present a unified front to stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Vision:</strong> Recognizing that transforming the military is a multi-year process requiring sustained commitment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Defining the Problems:</strong> Translating vague concepts into actionable operational problems, such as:
<ul>
<li><strong>Denying China Military Dominance:</strong> Specifically, developing the capability to neutralize 350 Chinese ships within the first three days of a conflict, a challenge requiring advanced ISR, real-time information sharing, and rapid decision-making.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shifting the Paradigm:</strong> Moving away from traditional requirements and budget processes towards:
<ul>
<li><strong>Mission-Focused Competitions:</strong> Allocating significant funding to real-world competitions that identify the best solutions to specific operational challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Rewarding Winners:</strong> Providing substantial funding and fielding opportunities to the winners of these competitions, regardless of their affiliation (military service, established company, or startup).</li>
<li><strong>Embracing Rivalry:</strong> Leveraging the inherent rivalries between military branches and companies to drive innovation and accelerate the development of effective solutions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Transitioning Incrementally:</strong> Acknowledging that the shift from legacy platforms to future technologies will be gradual:
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Enhancement:</strong> New technologies will initially enhance existing platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Gradual Replacement:</strong> Over time, new technologies may replace legacy systems entirely.</li>
<li><strong>Mission Adaptation:</strong> Traditional platforms may find new roles, such as homeland defense, as their relevance in high-intensity conflicts diminishes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Power of Demonstration:</strong> Showing, not just telling, to build support for change:
<ul>
<li><strong>Deterrence through Demonstration:</strong> Convincing adversaries of U.S. military capabilities by showcasing new technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Domestic Persuasion:</strong> Demonstrating the effectiveness of new solutions to skeptical military leaders and policymakers to build domestic political support.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fostering-a-vibrant-defense-technology-ecosystem">Fostering a Vibrant Defense Technology Ecosystem</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Problem:</strong> A lack of private investment in defense technology due to:
<ul>
<li><strong>Perceived Risk:</strong> The defense sector is viewed as a risky investment with a high failure rate for new technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Government Commitment:</strong> The government often fails to purchase promising technologies at scale, discouraging private investment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Solution:</strong> Creating incentives for private investment by:
<ul>
<li><strong>Picking Winners:</strong> Identifying and investing heavily in companies developing essential technologies like AI and autonomous systems.</li>
<li><strong>Clear Signals:</strong> Sending strong signals to the market about the government’s commitment to purchasing these technologies in large quantities.</li>
<li><strong>Multiplier Effect:</strong> Large government contracts will attract significantly more private investment, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation and growth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rethinking Earmarks:</strong> Reconsidering the ban on congressional earmarks, with safeguards for transparency and accountability, to enable Congress to directly fund promising defense technologies.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Lobbying:</strong> Encouraging companies developing future-oriented military capabilities to actively lobby for their programs and secure political support.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Addressing the “Culture Problem”:</strong> The U.S. defense establishment needs to overcome its risk-averse, bureaucratic culture and embrace agility, competition, and a willingness to fail.</li>

</section>
<section id="what-is-replicates-approach-to-logging-evals-and-secrets" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-replicates-approach-to-logging-evals-and-secrets">What is Replicate’s approach to logging, evals, and secrets?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logging Predictions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Replicate logs inputs, outputs, and content printed to logs within the <code>predict</code> function.</li>
<li>Each prediction has a permanent link for accessing these logs, aiding debugging and collaboration.</li>
<li>Example: The formatted prompt and random seed were deemed important and thus included in the logs of a specific model.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Secrets Management:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Replicate now allows secret input types for sensitive information like API tokens.</li>
<li>When defining a <code>predict</code> method with <code>type=secret</code>, an API signature is generated with a <code>secret</code> type argument, ensuring secure handling and redaction in logs and shared predictions.</li>
<li>Current Limitation: Secrets are not accessible during model setup, requiring workarounds for tasks like downloading weights.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Evals (Model Evaluation):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Replicate has not yet focused extensively on providing tools for evaluating model performance over time or analyzing user interaction patterns.</li>
<li>Future Considerations: There’s interest in incorporating such features, potentially starting with exploratory data analysis (EDA) on prediction logs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="data-retention" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-retention">Data Retention</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Retention Policies:</strong>
<ul>

<li>The data is encrypted and not shared with external parties.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Flexible Retention and User Concerns:</strong>
<ul>
<li>They offer flexible retention options for users with specific data sensitivity needs, particularly regarding privacy and legal compliance.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="user-feedback-mechanism" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="user-feedback-mechanism">User Feedback Mechanism</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Feedback Options:</strong>
<ul>
<li>While some Replicate web apps, such as the Llama 2 chat application, have built-in feedback mechanisms, there is no platform-wide solution for capturing user feedback on model predictions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Future Considerations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Replicate is exploring the implementation of a thumbs-up/thumbs-down feedback mechanism or annotation system for logging user evaluations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Alternative Solutions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Users can create their own feedback logging systems by associating prediction IDs with feedback data stored in a separate database.</li>
<li>This allows users to track model performance based on their specific criteria and use cases.</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="boredom-in-the-classroom">Boredom in the Classroom</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Experience:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Taught for 30 years, observing pervasive boredom in schools.</li>
<li>Students found work stupid, meaningless, and unengaging.</li>
<li>Teachers were equally bored, blaming students’ lack of interest and focus on grades.</li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Grandfather’s Lesson:</strong> Boredom is the individual’s responsibility, not an external condition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Root of the Problem:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Schools perpetuate childishness by treating boredom and obedience as the norm.</li>
<li>Gatto observed that breaking free from these structures could foster curiosity, adventure, and resilience in students.</li>

<section id="questioning-the-system" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="questioning-the-system">Questioning the System</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>A System Functioning as Designed:</strong>
<ul>
<li>What if schools are intentionally designed to produce the observed outcomes?</li>
<li>Could the goal be to prevent genuine growth and maintain a controllable populace?</li>
<li>Is forced schooling truly necessary, especially considering successful individuals who thrived without it?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Historical Perspective:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Many accomplished figures throughout American history lacked formal schooling.</li>
<li>Formal schooling does not guarantee success.</li>
<li>Compulsory schooling became widespread in the US between 1905 and 1915.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>H. L. Mencken (The American Mercury, April 1924):</strong>
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The aim of public education is not to fill the young of the species with knowledge and awaken their intelligence… The aim is simply to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level, to breed and train a standardized citizenry, to put down dissent and originality.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Prussian Model:</strong>
<ul>
<li>American education is rooted in the Prussian system.</li>
<li>Designed to create a manageable populace through:
<ul>
<li>Mediocre intellect.</li>
<li>Suppression of individuality.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-factory-inspectors-survey-1909">The Factory Inspector’s Survey (1909)</h4>
<ul>
<li>A survey of 500 working children in 20 factories revealed that 412 of them preferred the harsh conditions of factory work to returning to school. (Source: Helen Todd, <em>Why Children Work</em>, McClure’s Magazine, April 1913)
<ul>

<li>Helen Todd received various reasons from children for favoring factory work, including:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Monetary Factors:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Being paid for the factory work they do.</li>
<li>The ability to support their families financially, afford more food, shoes for babies, and other basic needs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Difficulty and Relevance of Schoolwork:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Perceived difficulty in understanding schoolwork compared to factory work.</li>
<li>Learning being perceived as hard.</li>
<li>Some children feeling unable to learn.</li>
<li>Perception that school education is not relevant to their ability to earn.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Environment at School and Factory:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Preference for the factory environment as there is less judgment compared to school.</li>
<li>The factory environment doesn’t involve name-calling or bullying as in school.</li>
<li>They can avoid the corporal punishment experienced at school for:
<ul>
<li>Failure to learn</li>
<li>Whispering</li>
<li>Having string in their pocket</li>
<li>Squeaky seats</li>
<li>Late arrival</li>
<li>Forgetting pages of the book</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Implication:</strong> This finding challenges the conventional narrative that school is a universally desired and beneficial experience, suggesting that early schools were deeply flawed and potentially more unbearable than child labor.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-rise-of-the-experts-1919-1933">The Rise of the “Experts” (1919-1933)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Professor Arthur Calhoun</strong> (Social History of the Family, 1919) observed a shift from family-centered child rearing to a system where <strong>community experts</strong> increasingly controlled education. (page 175)
<ul>
<li>Calhoun believed this change aligned with the eugenics movement, promoting the idea of selective breeding and social control through education. (page 331)</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mayor John Hyland</strong> of New York City (1922) claimed that an “<strong>invisible government</strong>” had seized control of the city’s schools, likening the situation to an octopus capturing its prey.
<ul>
<li>Hyland pointed to the <strong>Rockefeller Foundation</strong> as a driving force behind this shift in power.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By 1928, <em>A Sociological Philosophy of Education</em> asserted that teachers were responsible for “running not merely schools, but the world.”

<li><strong>Edward Thorndyke</strong> (Columbia Teachers College, 1929), a prominent figure in <strong>Educational Psychology</strong>, declared that traditional <strong>academic subjects are of little value</strong>.
<ul>
<li>This statement reflects a move away from traditional academic goals towards a focus on social engineering and behavioral conditioning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>William Kilpatrick</strong> (Columbia Teachers College, <em>Education and the Social Crisis</em>, 1929) advocated for expert control over child rearing, arguing that families were ill-equipped compared to trained professionals.
<ul>
<li>This perspective underscores the growing influence of a technocratic elite seeking to manage society through scientific methods.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Max Mason</strong>, President of the Rockefeller Foundation (April 11, 1933), announced a national program aimed at controlling human behavior, with schools playing a central role.
<ul>
<li>This announcement signaled an open embrace of social engineering as a primary goal of education.</li>
<li>The program drew inspiration from <strong>Max Muller</strong>, a geneticist who believed in the possibility of controlling human evolution through genetic manipulation.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-eugenics-connection">The Eugenics Connection</h4>
<ul>
<li>The influence of eugenics, a movement advocating for selective breeding to improve the human race, played a significant role in shaping early 20th-century education reform.
<ul>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> To separate “worthwhile breeding stock” from the “evolutionary dead-end material” (Source: Muller’s geneticist’s manifesto, signed by 22 prominent biologists).</li>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> This ideology promoted segregation and discrimination within the education system, reinforcing social hierarchies based on perceived intellectual ability and social worth.</li>

<ul>
<li>World War II temporarily drove eugenics underground, but its core principles continued to influence education policy.
<ul>
<li>The focus shifted towards using schools as tools for social control and economic manipulation, aligning with the needs of a burgeoning industrial capitalist system.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Two congressional investigations (1915 and 1959) revealed that school policy was being shaped by corporate interests operating outside of public scrutiny.
<ul>
<li><strong>Findings:</strong> Both investigations concluded that major foundations like Carnegie and Rockefeller exerted significant influence over education policy through funding, research, and advocacy.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> These investigations were largely ignored, and their findings suppressed, highlighting the lack of transparency and accountability within the education system.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher training underwent a radical transformation, driven by private foundations, universities, and government agencies, with the goal of aligning education with the needs of the emerging global economy.</li>
<li><strong>Three key milestones:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>1. Designing Education for the Future:</strong> A government initiative that redefined education as a means to achieve national economic and social goals.

</ul></li>
<li><strong>2. The Behavioral Science Teacher Education Project (BSTEP):</strong> A large-scale project (Contract No.&nbsp;OEC-09-320424-4042) outlining plans to transform schools into laboratories for behavioral conditioning.
<ul>
<li><strong>Goals:</strong> To create a system where individuals are tracked from birth, exposed to subliminal influence, and conditioned to conform to predetermined beliefs and behaviors.</li>
<li><strong>Methods:</strong> Advocated for the use of chemical experimentation on minors, foreshadowing the rise of drugs like Ritalin and Adderall in classrooms.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>3. Bloom’s Taxonomy of Educational Objectives:</strong> A comprehensive manual by <strong>Benjamin Bloom</strong> (University of Chicago) that aimed to classify and control all aspects of human learning.

<ul>
<li>Rising school violence in the 1960s, partly attributed to policies restricting disciplinary action, provided a pretext for further intervention.
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Ford Foundation’s</strong> policy mandating “<strong>due process</strong>” in schools hampered teachers’ ability to maintain order and address disruptive behavior effectively.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>BSTEP advocated for training teachers as “<strong>teacher therapists</strong>,” tasked with applying behavioral psychology techniques to manage students’ emotions and modify their behavior.</li>
<li>This shift marked a significant departure from traditional teaching roles, transforming educators into agents of social control.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="we-dont-need-brains">“We Don’t Need Brains”</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Historical Context:</strong> Between 1896 and 1920, industrialists and financiers like <strong>Andrew Carnegie</strong> and <strong>John D. Rockefeller</strong>, through their foundations, heavily influenced the development of compulsory schooling in the US.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>To create a workforce that was obedient, compliant, and trained for specific tasks rather than independent thinking and innovation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Evidence:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>The General Education Board</strong> (funded by Rockefeller), in its 1906 <strong>Occasional Letter No.&nbsp;1</strong>, stated its aim:
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“In our dreams, people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hands…We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning…The task…is very simple. We will organize children and teach them to do in a perfect way the things their fathers and mothers are doing in an imperfect way.”</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-literacy-decline-a-case-study-in-failure">The Literacy Decline: A Case Study in Failure</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>World War II Literacy Data:</strong> A high literacy rate (96%) was observed among men drafted during World War II (schooled in the 1930s), with only 4% deemed illiterate. (Source: Army enlistment tests)</li>
<li><strong>Korean War Literacy Decline:</strong> A significant drop in literacy (down to 81%) was observed among men drafted during the Korean War (schooled in the 1940s).</li>
<li><strong>Vietnam War Literacy Crisis:</strong> Illiteracy rates continued to rise, reaching 27% among men drafted during the Vietnam War (schooled in the 1950s and 1960s).</li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Despite increased years of schooling, more qualified teachers, and “improved” educational materials, literacy rates steadily declined.</li>
<li>This suggests that changes in teaching methods, particularly the shift from <strong>phonetic</strong> to <strong>non-phonetic</strong> reading instruction, played a significant role in the decline.</li>
<li>The lack of a phonetic foundation disproportionately impacted Black Americans, who historically had limited access to formal education and relied on schools to teach basic literacy skills.</li>
<li>The <strong>Adult Literacy Survey</strong> and the <strong>National Assessment of Educational Progress</strong> later reported a 40% illiteracy rate among Black Americans and 17% among White Americans.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="william-torrey-harris-the-architect-of-american-indoctrination">William Torrey Harris: The Architect of American Indoctrination</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background:</strong> <strong>William Torrey Harris</strong>, U.S. Commissioner of Education (1889-1906), was a leading proponent of Hegelian philosophy and a close friend of Andrew Carnegie.</li>
<li><strong>Influence:</strong> Harris played a pivotal role in shaping the American education system, promoting standardization and German-style compulsory schooling.</li>
<li><strong>Philosophy:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Harris believed that children were property of the state and that education’s purpose was to create citizens who were obedient, subservient to authority, and alienated from their individuality.</strong></li>
<li>He advocated for schools that were designed to “<strong>transcend the beauty of nature</strong>” and promote withdrawal from the external world.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Key Quotes:</strong>
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“<strong>Ninety-nine students out of a hundred are automata, careful to walk in prescribed paths, careful to follow the prescribed custom. This is not an accident but the result of substantial education which, scientifically defined, is the subsumption of the individual.</strong>” (Source: <em>The Philosophy of Education</em>, 1906)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“<strong>The great purpose of school [is] self-alienation…It is to master the physical self, to transcend the beauty of nature. School should develop the power to withdraw from the external world.</strong>” (Source: <em>The Philosophy of Education</em>, 1906)</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Harris’s ideas laid the groundwork for an education system designed to create a compliant workforce rather than critical thinkers. His influence can still be felt in the emphasis on standardized testing, conformity, and the suppression of creativity within many schools today.</li>

<section id="the-fourth-purpose-creating-human-resources" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-fourth-purpose-creating-human-resources">The Fourth Purpose: Creating Human Resources</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Original Purpose of Schooling:</strong> The traditional goals of education—moral development, civic responsibility, and personal growth—were gradually supplanted by a new objective: to produce human resources for the industrial economy.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate Influence:</strong> As schools became increasingly intertwined with the needs of business and industry, the curriculum shifted towards vocational training, obedience to authority, and the acceptance of a hierarchical social order.</li>
<li><strong>Woodrow Wilson’s Vision (1909):</strong> In a speech to businessmen, Wilson stated,
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“<strong>We want one class to have a liberal education. We want another class, a very much larger class of necessity, to forego the privilege of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific, difficult manual tasks.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Centralized Control:</strong> The rise of the “<strong>Education Trust</strong>” in 1917, comprised of representatives from powerful foundations, elite universities, and the National Education Association, further consolidated control over education policy in the hands of a select few.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences:</strong> This shift in purpose transformed schools from institutions of learning into factories for producing compliant workers, undermining the ideals of a free and democratic society.</li>

<section id="the-problem-of-overproduction" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem-of-overproduction">The Problem of Overproduction</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Overproduction</strong>, also known as <strong>overcapacity</strong>, occurs when businesses produce more goods and services than the market can consume, leading to falling prices, economic instability, and social unrest.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Context:</strong> In the 19th century, America’s independent and resourceful population, coupled with its high levels of innovation, frequently led to overproduction and economic downturns.</li>
<li><strong>The Role of Education:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Policymakers and business leaders began to view education as a tool to manage overproduction by shaping consumer demand and limiting independent economic activity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> By conditioning citizens from a young age to become reliable employees rather than self-sufficient producers, the threat of overproduction could be mitigated.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences:</strong> This approach transformed education from a means of fostering independence and innovation into a tool for controlling the workforce and maintaining economic stability for the benefit of those in power.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The American Experiment:</strong> For the first two centuries of its existence, the United States thrived on a system of open-source learning, where individuals were free to pursue knowledge and skills through apprenticeship, self-study, and community engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Figures like Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and David Farragut exemplified the success of this approach, demonstrating that traditional education was not a prerequisite for achieving greatness.</li>
<li><strong>The Value of Self-Reliance:</strong> This system fostered independence, ingenuity, and a spirit of innovation, propelling America to the forefront of global progress.</li>
<li><strong>The Need for a Paradigm Shift:</strong> Gatto argues for a return to the principles of open-source learning, recognizing that the current system of compulsory schooling stifles creativity, limits human potential, and perpetuates social inequalities.</li>

<li><strong>The Urgency of Reform:</strong> The consequences of this system—declining literacy rates, rising social inequality, and a culture of conformity—demand urgent attention and a radical rethinking of education’s purpose.</li>
<li><strong>A Call to Action:</strong> The book serves as a wake-up call to reclaim the transformative power of education, urging readers to question assumptions, challenge the status quo, and create alternative systems that empower individuals and foster a more just and equitable society.</li>

<li>Gatto argues that School District 3 fails to teach students the essential skills needed to thrive in the evolving global economy.
<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence:</strong> A brochure from Harvard University outlining nine essential skills for success in the new international economy is cited as a benchmark.
<ul>
<li><h4 id="nine-essential-skills" class="anchored">Nine Essential Skills:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ability to ask hard questions of data from various sources.</li>
<li>Ability to define problems independently.</li>
<li>Ability to extract useful information from irrelevant data.</li>
<li>Ability to conceptualize.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto presents David Sarnoff’s life as a counterpoint to the failures of the education system.
<ul>
<li><strong>David Sarnoff’s Accomplishments:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Learned English and became a successful newsboy within five months of arriving in New York City at age nine, after his father died.</li>
<li>Owned his own newsstand at fourteen, using newspapers as his primary learning source.</li>
<li>Became an office boy at Marconi Wireless at fourteen through sheer initiative.</li>
<li>Taught himself telegraphy, leading to a successful career in the burgeoning field of radio technology.</li>
<li>Became president of RCA at age 39.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>A pervasive culture of negativity and limitations (“you can’t do this, you can’t do that”).</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto argues that a culture of complacency, self-preservation, and corruption within the district perpetuates its failures.
<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence:</strong>
<ul>
<li>High teacher turnover rate (22% annually) is attributed to a “caste system” that rewards favored teachers with desirable assignments while burdening others with impossible workloads.</li>
<li>Inflated administrative bureaucracy and a “shadow economy” divert resources away from teaching and contribute to a deceptive student-teacher ratio.</li>
<li>Administrators prioritize their careers and maintaining the status quo over meaningful educational reform.</li>
<li>A principal’s statement that students’ futures are predetermined, highlighting a defeatist attitude toward disadvantaged students.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto identifies two specific district policies that have had a detrimental impact on students’ ability to learn and thrive.
<ul>
<li><strong>Policy 1: Tolerance of Disruptive Behavior:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The decision, influenced by the Ford Foundation, to not control disruptive classroom behavior out of concern for students’ self-esteem is criticized as misguided and harmful.</li>
<li>Gatto contends that this policy has created a chaotic learning environment that hinders all students, including those who are well-behaved.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Policy 2: Recruitment of Disruptive Students:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The district’s practice of recruiting disruptive students from other areas to mask declining enrollment is condemned as a cynical maneuver that exacerbates the existing problems.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto argues that the current education system functions as a “narcotic,” addicting children to passivity, entertainment, and a detachment from reality.
<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Students’ lack of interest in exploration, play, and personal growth.</li>
<li>Excessive consumption of television, music videos, and computer games.</li>
<li>The observation that children from stable, two-parent households where the mother does not work engage in far less passive entertainment.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The education system, instead of fostering critical thinking and engagement with the world, cultivates a dependence on superficial stimulation and an inability to cope with the demands of a meaningful life.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i-quit-i-think-a-scathing-critique-of-schooling">I Quit, I Think: A Scathing Critique of Schooling</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto’s essay, “I Quit, I Think,” published in the Wall Street Journal, outlines their reasons for leaving the profession:
<ul>
<li><strong>Government schooling is the most radical adventure in history</strong>, killing the family by:
<ul>
<li>Monopolizing childhood’s best times.</li>
<li>Teaching disrespect for home and parents.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The structure of schooling is rooted in an <strong>Egyptian, not Greek or Roman, blueprint</strong>, based on the belief that:
<ul>
<li><strong>Human value is scarce</strong>, symbolized by a pyramid’s narrow peak.</li>
<li>This idea, passed down through the Puritans, found scientific expression in the <strong>bell curve</strong>, which suggests talent is biologically determined.</li>
<li><strong>School serves as the church of this religious notion, with rituals to maintain orthodoxy.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Professional educators benefit from making the simple seem complex</strong>, subordinating the public to their expertise.</li>
<li><strong>School, as a jobs program, contract provider, and guardian of the social order, resists reform.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reform efforts fail to fundamentally change the system.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Standardized measures like age grading and testing are arbitrary and harmful</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Children develop at different paces, and judging them by uniform standards is illogical.</li>
<li>Gatto uses the example of David (reading at age 4) and Rachel (reading at age 9), who show no difference in reading ability at age 13.</li>
<li>School, however, would label Rachel as learning disabled and hold David back, creating artificial categories and dependencies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto argues that <strong>learning disabilities and giftedness are “sacred myths,”</strong> perpetuating the school system.</li>
<li><strong>True education is not standardized;</strong> there are countless ways to learn, like fingerprints.</li>
<li><strong>State-certified teachers are not essential for education and may hinder it.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Good schools need free-market choices and variety, not more money or time.</strong></li>
<li><strong>National curriculum and testing are based on ignorance of how people learn.</strong></li>
<li>Gatto concludes, unable to participate in a system that harms children, and seeks alternative work.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-religion-of-schooling-and-the-myth-of-dumbness">A Religion of Schooling and the Myth of Dumbness</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto reflects on their 30-year career, questioning how they participated in an <strong>indoctrinating and sorting machine</strong> that steals children’s potential.</li>
<li>School, they argue, is a <strong>religion</strong>; understanding its “holy mission” is crucial to understanding its workings.</li>
<li>While human failings exist within the system, they are not the root cause; <strong>schooling itself is designed to produce “dumbness.”</strong></li>
<li><strong>This new dumbness is not mere ignorance but a categorization of relative stupidity</strong>, creating artificial hierarchies like:
<ul>
<li>Gifted and talented</li>
<li>Mainstream</li>
<li>Special Ed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These categories ration learning, benefiting the system and social order.</li>
<li>The <strong>“new dumb” are perceived as dangerous and require conditioning with “commercially prepared disinformation.”</strong></li>
<li>This dumbness particularly harms middle and upper-middle-class children, already pressured to conform, leaving them vulnerable to existential crises later in life.</li>
<li>Gatto cites English historian Alan Bullock: <strong>“Evil is a state of incompetence.”</strong> Schooling, they argue, has filled the 20th century with evil by breaking children to a system that rewards compliance over critical thinking.</li>
<li>This system produces individuals dependent on group approval, exemplified by a National Merit Scholar in Gatto’s family who aspired to be “a small part in a great machine.”</li>
<li><strong>The “dumbed down” cannot think independently, constantly seeking external validation and vulnerable to manipulation.</strong></li>
<li>Gatto challenges prevalent explanations for “dumbness”:
<ul>
<li><strong>Biological determinism (the bell curve)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Capitalist oppression (neo-Marxism)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Moral failing (Calvinism)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Natural selection (Darwinism)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Social utility (pragmatic elitism)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Karmic retribution (Buddhism)</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>All these explanations, Gatto contends, justify the existence of a vast bureaucracy to manage the “problem” of the “dumb.”</li>
<li>Gatto’s proposition: <strong>mass dumbness is a fabrication, not a reality.</strong> It was invented to serve the system.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto introduces <strong>Hector Rodriguez, a 13-year-old student</strong>, observed one November day:
<ul>
<li>Small, olive-skinned, with large black eyes.</li>
<li>Trying to slip past the Central Park skating rink gate despite having a paid ticket.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hector’s actions, puzzling at first, demonstrate his experimental nature—testing the gate’s security with a safety net (the ticket).</li>
<li>School records reveal Hector’s history:
<ul>
<li>Labeled an “outlaw” for minor infractions that would not have been criminalized in the past.</li>
<li>Attending one of New York State’s lowest-rated schools, facing potential state takeover.</li>
<li>Placed in the “Mainstream D” category, the lowest of the low, above only Special Ed.</li>
<li>Standardized test scores placed him three years behind his peers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite this, Hector displays initiative and a desire to challenge norms, as seen in his gate-crashing experiment.</li>
<li>His “criminal” record includes:
<ul>
<li>Being caught with a fake gun in his former elementary school during Christmas break.</li>
<li>Intending to “free the slaves” (the younger children) like a modern-day Spartacus.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This incident highlights the school’s perception of Hector as a problem, as expressed by the principal: “Gatto, what have you done to me?”</li>
<li>A year later, Hector’s high school record shows:
<ul>
<li>Failing every subject.</li>
<li>Excessive absences and truancy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The system paints a picture of Hector as a lost cause:
<ul>
<li>Poor, small, minority, ignored, “dumb,” a trouble-maker, a failure.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto asks: <strong>What is society to do with its Hectors?</strong></li>
<li>Hector represents millions of children deemed problematic by the education system.</li>
<li>Gatto argues that <strong>schooling was reimagined to control children like Hector</strong>, turning it into:
<ul>
<li>A warehouse</li>
<li>A behavior modification clinic</li>
<li>A tool for attitude adjustment</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This system is justified as a defense against chaos, with Hector representing the chaos that needs taming.</li>
<li>The principal, in the documentary about Gatto’s class, acknowledges the system’s flaws but defends it as better than chaos.</li>
<li>Gatto challenges this notion: <strong>Is chaos the only alternative to a stifling system?</strong></li>
<li><strong>The real demon, Gatto argues, is the misperception that Hector is the problem.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Forced schooling, presented as a bulwark against chaos, is actually the source of the problem.</strong></li>
<li>The belief that <strong>human nature’s irrationality must be suppressed</strong> is presented as a dangerous dogma driving the education system.</li>

<li>Gatto sought a solution to counteract the negative effects of excessive media consumption, recognizing that traditional preaching was ineffective.</li>
<li>Gatto believed that relief could be found by encouraging physical activity and real-life experiences, as opposed to passively consuming media.</li>
<li>The core issue identified was the suppression of <strong>natural feedback circuits</strong>, which are essential for learning from mistakes.</li>
<li>Gatto uses the example of learning to sail:
<ul>
<li>A novice sailor will inevitably make mistakes, such as tacking too far left or right.</li>
<li>However, through practice and feedback, the sailor learns to adjust and improve.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Similarly, mastering speech requires significant practice and feedback.</li>
<li>Gatto argues that bureaucracies, including school systems, often fail because they cannot efficiently respond to feedback.
<ul>
<li>They are bound by rigid rules and resistant to input from parents, teachers, students, or outside sources.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Gatto’s solution was a <strong>guerrilla curriculum</strong> designed to restore natural feedback circuits in children.</li>
<li>This curriculum targeted inactivity and activities that did not significantly engage feedback mechanisms.</li>
<li>Gatto believed that sufficient activity, regardless of its specific nature, would motivate children to reduce their screen time.</li>
<li>The goal was to shift children from being passive spectators to active participants in their own lives.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration from the Camino de Santiago:</strong>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Gatto, a teacher of 30 years, realized early in his career that school diminishes intellectual power, creativity, and character.
<ul>
<li>He compares the school system to a penitentiary, with rules and procedures acting as guards.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Inspired by Lusserin, Gatto sought to peacefully sabotage the system.
<ul>
<li>He developed a formula for individualized learning:
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1: Comprehensive Student Biography</strong>
<ul>
<li>Assemble a detailed biography of each student, going beyond school records to include information from family, friends, and others who know the student well.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Step 2: Personal Wishes and Weaknesses</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ask each student to list:
<ul>
<li><strong>Three things they want to learn by the year’s end.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Three weaknesses they want to overcome.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>This approach motivated students, encouraging hard work and self-directed learning.</li>
<li>Gatto also embarked on extensive research into the history and purpose of schooling:
<ul>
<li>He read thousands of books, traveled extensively, and engaged in debates about education.</li>
<li>His research culminated in a book, <em>The Underground History of American Education</em>, which a major publisher refused to publish, deeming it too controversial.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto’s teaching practices were informed by his research and daring field experiments conducted with his students (referred to as “gatos-gorillas”):

<li><strong>Education:</strong> Aims to compensate for the negative psychological effects of capitalism, fostering critical thinking, creativity, and well-rounded individuals.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto recounts his experience with an elective program at Lincoln Academy, a public junior high school in a wealthy, intellectually vibrant area of Manhattan.</li>
<li>Despite its location and resources, the school was plagued by violence, apathy, and a disconnect between the administration’s rhetoric and the reality of student experiences.</li>
<li>Gatto’s attempt to engage students in an elective on epic poetry was met with resistance and revealed a system where students lacked agency and genuine choice.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="school-as-a-breeding-ground-for-contempt">School as a Breeding Ground for Contempt</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto cites a 2005 Indiana University study on anti-smoking programs in schools.
<ul>
<li>The study found that all school-based programs, despite significant funding, failed.</li>
<li>The lead researcher, Dr.&nbsp;Sarah Wee, suggested that school environments inherently breed contempt in students, undermining any initiative.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto connects this finding to the story of Roger Gaufrin, the sole survivor of the Oradour-sur-Glane massacre in World War II.
<ul>
<li>Gaufrin’s contempt for school, which led him to disobey his teachers’ instructions to gather in the town square, saved his life.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-pervasive-irrelevance-of-school-curricula">The Pervasive Irrelevance of School Curricula</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto argues that school curricula are often irrelevant to students’ lives and future needs.</li>
<li>He attributes this to the political nature of schooling, where powerful entities influence what is taught and omitted.</li>
<li>Examples of irrelevance:
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of environmental education in Australia:</strong> Despite the country’s fragile ecosystem and the impact of human activities (e.g., sheep farming), schools avoid addressing these critical issues due to political pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Limited coverage of sensitive historical topics:</strong> Schools often gloss over or omit controversial aspects of history (e.g., religious wars, social inequality), depriving students of a complete understanding of the past.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on reading over speaking:</strong> Despite the importance of spoken language in everyday life, schools prioritize reading and writing, neglecting this crucial skill.</li>
<li><strong>Neglect of statistics in mathematics:</strong> While statistical reasoning is essential for navigating the modern world, school math curricula often focus on abstract concepts with limited practical application.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto uses the example of evolution to illustrate how schools present biased perspectives as absolute truth.
<ul>
<li>He contrasts the theories of Charles Darwin (survival of the fittest) and Alfred Russel Wallace (adaptation and cooperation):
<ul>
<li><strong>Darwin’s theory:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Aligned with the prevailing social and political ideology of 19th-century Britain, justifying imperialism, social Darwinism, and eugenics.</li>
<li>Gained prominence due to Darwin’s social standing and connections.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Wallace’s theory:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Challenged the status quo by advocating for social justice and cooperation.</li>
<li>Largely ignored or dismissed due to Wallace’s lower social class and radical views.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto argues that schools omit Wallace’s perspective to maintain a specific narrative that supports existing power structures.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-control-of-information-from-explosives-to-education">The Control of Information: From Explosives to Education</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto highlights the historical shift in access to information, using explosives as an example:
<ul>
<li>In the early 20th century, instructions for making explosives were readily available, reflecting a time when self-reliance and the ability to defend oneself were valued.</li>
<li>Today, such information is heavily restricted, reflecting a shift towards greater government control and a distrust of citizens’ ability to handle powerful knowledge.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto argues that this control extends to education, where schools limit access to information that could challenge the status quo or empower individuals to think critically about the world around them.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto contends that school contributes to physical and psychological ugliness in students.
<ul>
<li>He argues that the enforced immobility, stress, and unhealthy diets prevalent in schools lead to obesity, low vitality, and a lack of grace.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He highlights the hypocrisy of a system that promotes physical education while simultaneously fostering environments detrimental to physical well-being.</li>
<li>Gatto connects this to the unspoken bias towards physical appearance in elite college admissions:
<ul>
<li>Universities prioritize attractive, athletic candidates, recognizing the advantages these qualities offer in life.</li>
<li>This preference is rarely acknowledged or discussed in high schools, perpetuating a system where students are judged not solely on their intellectual merits but also on superficial traits.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto cites Langdon Winner’s book, <em>Autonomous Technology</em>, which argues that modern society is characterized by a reliance on technology that most people do not understand.
<ul>
<li>Winner compares this to a “fundamental bewilderment” similar to that of a newborn child.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto suggests that school, instead of equipping students to navigate this complexity, perpetuates a state of dependence and intellectual immaturity.</li>
<li>He argues that true learning happens despite school, not because of it, as the emphasis on winning overshadows genuine intellectual curiosity.</li>
<li>He cites Seymour Papert’s belief that learning can be as natural and enjoyable as a child learning to talk, suggesting that traditional schooling is an outdated model.</li>
<li>Gatto points to the rise of homeschooling and the increasing dropout rate as evidence of a growing dissatisfaction with the current system.</li>

<li><strong>Excerpt from a 1940 speech by Walter Lippmann to the Association for the Advancement of Science:</strong>
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“During the past 40 or 50 years, those who are responsible for education have progressively removed from the curriculum the Western culture which produced the modern democratic state. The schools and colleges have therefore been sending out into the world men who no longer understand the creative principle of the society in which they must live. Deprived of their cultural tradition, the newly educated Western men no longer possess in the form and substance of their own minds and spirits and ideas the premises, the rationale, the logic, the methods, the values of the deposited wisdom which are the genius of the development of Western civilization. The prevailing education is destined, if it continues, to destroy Western civilization and is in fact destroying it.”</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Scientific management</strong>, as championed by Frederick Taylor (<strong>“Principles of Scientific Management,”</strong> 1911), prioritizes <strong>subordination</strong> above all else.
<ul>
<li>This principle permeates various sectors: business, government, schooling, religion, social work, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hierarchy and Predictability:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bureaucracies rely on hierarchy, where productivity is secondary to obedience.</li>
<li>Subordination ensures employees are confined to their roles, making them predictable and controllable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Eliminating Independent Thinkers:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Educated individuals and those with strong principles pose a threat to scientific management.</li>
<li>They are capable of critical thought, questioning authority, and acting on their own moral compass.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Ideal Hireling:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The ideal worker is unquestioningly obedient, enthusiastic, and eager to please.</li>
<li>This training begins in the first grade with the word “don’t.”</li>

<ul>
<li>Primary school, instead of nurturing self-development, focuses on limitations.</li>
<li><strong>Examples of “don’ts” in school:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Don’t run, talk, climb trees, play rough.</li>
<li>Don’t talk without raising your hand, fidget, get out of your seat, stare out the window, take your shoes off.</li>
<li>Don’t eat or drink in class, laugh, take too long.</li>
<li>Don’t read ahead, go off the path, say “I’m bored.”</li>
<li>Don’t mix with older kids, complain, bring toys.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Implied “don’ts”:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Don’t have your own ideas, show initiative, be independent, make your own choices, take responsibility for your own learning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consequences of Constant Negativity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The endless “don’ts” stifle creativity, curiosity, and a sense of agency.</li>
<li>They foster indifference, leading to escapism through negative outlets (violence, drugs, etc.).</li>

<ul>
<li>A 2005 permission form from Queen Elizabeth Junior and Senior High School (Calgary, Canada) exemplifies how schools discourage direct experience.</li>
<li><strong>Exaggerated List of Potential Hazards:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The form lists numerous mundane risks associated with a museum trip (bus travel, weather, tripping hazards, etc.).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Creating Fear and Aversion to Risk:</strong>
<ul>
<li>This approach fosters a culture of fear and discourages parents and children from engaging in real-world experiences.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Following the Prussian model (William Torrey Harris), schools prioritize collectivism over individuality.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Categorizing Children:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Children are treated as members of groups rather than unique individuals.</li>
<li>Examples: race, academic ability, socioeconomic status, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Lowest Common Denominator:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Collectivism leads to a focus on the average, neglecting the needs of individual students.</li>
<li>This results in a lowering of standards and a focus on the lowest common denominator.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example: New York City Schools (2002-2008):</strong>

<li>A truly educated mind is connected to ideas, experiences, people, and itself.</li>
<li>It embraces diverse perspectives, engages in real-world experiences, and values self-knowledge.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>School-Induced Disconnection:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Schools, however, prioritize disconnection:
<ul>
<li>Separation from families, traditions, communities, religions, peers, interests.</li>
<li>Disconnection from the Western intellectual tradition.</li>
<li>Limited opportunities for risk-taking and adventure.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Gatto’s experience critiquing a private school curriculum:</strong>
<ul>
<li>While impressed with the school’s environment, two concerns arose:
<ol type="1">
<li>Students were not encouraged to participate in discussions about their own education.</li>
<li>The use of a simplified version of Homer’s “Odyssey” raised concerns about diluting challenging material.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Talking Choo-Choo Analogy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A talking choo-choo in a workbook symbolizes the trend of simplifying and infantilizing education.</li>
<li>This “German disease” artificially extends childhood and undermines intellectual development.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Perpetuating Childishness:</strong>
<ul>
<li>This approach creates a dependence on simplified information and a fear of complex ideas.</li>
<li>It fosters a culture of instant gratification and a lack of critical thinking.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Examples of the Talking Choo-Choo Syndrome:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Slasher films, pornography, fast food, tabloid news.</li>
<li>The glorification of youth and the reluctance to engage with adult complexities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Historical Roots:</strong>
<ul>
<li>This strategy of control through infantilization can be traced back to:
<ul>
<li>John Calvin’s “Institutes” (1535)</li>
<li>Baruch Spinoza’s “Tractate” (1670)</li>
<li>Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s educational reforms in 19th-century Prussia.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Education was readily attainable in America.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Schooling was:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Voluntary</li>
<li>Short in duration</li>
<li>Did not monopolize a child’s time</li>
<li>Did not burden families</li>
<li>Did not instill servile habits in the young</li>
<li>Did not indoctrinate with pre-determined thoughts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fewer people claiming to provide education resulted in greater freedom to learn.</li>

<li>The possibility of obtaining a quality education is threatened by compulsory schooling.</li>
<li>Political roadblocks hinder change:
<ul>
<li>The current system financially benefits those in power.</li>
<li>Schools provide lucrative contracts and jobs, creating conflicts of interest for politicians.</li>
<li>Politicians are beholden to donors with vested interests in maintaining the status quo.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Assertion:</strong> Genuine change must come from individuals (parents, students, and teachers) who challenge the system.</li>
<li>Homeschooling is a prime example of this rebellion.</li>
<li>The system has had a century to prove itself and has failed.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1: Define an Educated Person:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A nationwide debate is needed to establish a clear definition of what constitutes an educated person.</li>
<li>Professional pedagogy has failed to provide a concrete definition beyond vague generalizations.</li>
<li>A shared understanding of educational goals is crucial for meaningful reform.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exposing the Fallacy of Standardized Testing:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current educational emphasis on standardized test scores is misguided.</strong></li>
<li><strong>High test scores do not necessarily translate to real-world competence or success.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong>** Many successful individuals (including U.S. presidents and corporate executives) have achieved success despite mediocre test scores.</li>
<li><strong>Inconsistency:</strong> While consumers demand performance data in other areas (e.g., horse racing), they are denied this information when it comes to educators.</li>
<li><strong>Distinction:</strong> High standards are not synonymous with standardized testing.</li>
<li><strong>Newspeak Manipulation:</strong> The public has been conditioned to equate the two.</li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Proposal:</strong> Schools should guarantee the development of valuable human competencies or lose their power to enforce attendance.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto’s granddaughter, Christina, is a rebellious and accomplished individual.
<ul>
<li>Rode her bike on Fifth Avenue in defiance of a city ban.</li>
<li>Captain of a national champion debating team.</li>
<li>Legally changed her name from Gudrun to Christina.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto comes from a long line of “boat rockers” and contrarians.
<ul>
<li>His wife Janet’s family was outlawed by the British Crown.</li>
<li>His great-great-grandmother from Glenorchy wore a top hat, a symbol of unconventionality.</li>
<li>The outlaw Rob Roy considered Gatto’s wife’s clan to be his own.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto and his wife Janet were married in a Buddhist temple near Columbia University in New York City.
<ul>
<li>They chose this location because they were both unemployed, broke, and underage for a civil marriage.</li>
<li>The Buddhist temple offered free marriage ceremonies, unlike other religious institutions they approached.</li>
<li>Janet was pregnant with Gatto’s daughter (Christina’s mother) at the time of their marriage.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto recounts the struggles and triumphs of his ancestors:
<ul>
<li><strong>His grandmother:</strong> Fired from a job for attempting to organize a union.</li>
<li><strong>Gatto:</strong> Fired from a job on Madison Avenue for incompetence.</li>
<li><strong>His great-great-grandfather Giovanni (Italian side):</strong>
<ul>
<li>A Presbyterian, journalist, and Freemason, he faced persecution in early 20th century Italy.</li>
<li>Forced to flee Italy with his wife, Lucrezia, who lost her inheritance and title for marrying him.</li>
<li>Found success in Pittsburgh working for Mellon Bank but died young from an extravagant lifestyle.</li>
<li>Buried in an unmarked grave by Lucrezia for having a mistress.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>His great-grandfather Harry Taylor Zimmer (German side):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Town printer and traveling circus owner in Monongahela, Pennsylvania.</li>
<li>A staunch Republican in a predominantly Democratic town.</li>
<li>Ran for mayor multiple times, using his printing press to launch scathing attacks on opponents.</li>
<li>Openly supported German victory during World War II, making Gatto’s childhood walks to school eventful.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto highlights the protective presence of his uncle, Bud Zimmer:
<ul>
<li>The toughest man in town, Bud’s reputation shielded Gatto from bullies.</li>
<li>Bud served as a field officer in World War II, his unit featured in newsreels.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto advises his granddaughter, Christina, to reconsider her pursuit of an Ivy League education at Dartmouth.
<ul>
<li>He believes that such institutions promote an illusion of social privilege and limit personal growth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He criticizes the modern education system:
<ul>
<li><strong>Promotes a hierarchical view of education:</strong> Elite colleges are falsely touted as the sole gateways to success.</li>
<li><strong>Instills a false sense of urgency:</strong> Students feel pressured to gain acceptance into prestigious colleges, leading to unhealthy competition and anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>Perpetuates social inequality:</strong> Gatto uses George Orwell’s <em>Animal Farm</em> analogy to criticize the elitist mindset prevalent in prestigious institutions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He challenges the notion that college guarantees success:
<ul>
<li>Financial success can be achieved through alternative paths.</li>
<li>True fulfillment comes from finding purpose and adding value to society.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He argues that true education is a personal journey of self-discovery:
<ul>
<li>It’s about developing critical thinking skills and navigating the complexities of the world.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He outlines eight essential elements of true learning:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Self-knowledge:</strong> Understanding one’s character, strengths, weaknesses, and tendencies.</li>
<li><strong>Observation:</strong> Cultivating sharp observational skills to gather accurate information.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Learning to receive and evaluate criticism effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Developing the ability to break down complex problems into manageable components.</li>
<li><strong>Mirroring:</strong> Cultivating empathy and the ability to understand diverse perspectives.</li>
<li><strong>Expression:</strong> Mastering clear and effective communication in both written and spoken forms.</li>
<li><strong>Judgment:</strong> Developing the ability to discern truth from falsehood and make sound decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Adding Value:</strong> Contributing meaningfully to society and every interaction.</li>

<section id="the-new-atlantis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-new-atlantis">The New Atlantis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto argues that the current education system, particularly in elite institutions like Dartmouth, is modeled after Francis Bacon’s <em>The New Atlantis</em>.</li>
<li>He outlines the core principles of Bacon’s vision:
<ul>
<li><strong>Utility over Reflection:</strong> Education should primarily focus on training a workforce for the needs of corporations and government institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Social Control:</strong> Universities should function as instruments to maintain social order and stability.</li>
<li><strong>Surveillance and Control:</strong> Implement systems to monitor and regulate the behavior and aspirations of the masses.</li>
<li><strong>Managed Morality:</strong> Promote a culture of permissiveness in personal morals while emphasizing conformity in professional life.</li>
<li><strong>Co-option of Potential Leaders:</strong> Identify and absorb talented individuals from lower classes into the ruling structure to prevent dissent.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto argues that this system has led to several negative consequences:
<ul>
<li><strong>Social Unrest:</strong> A growing sense of disillusionment and distrust in leadership due to increasing inequality and lack of opportunity.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Inequality:</strong> The widening gap between the rich and the poor, fueled by corporate greed and the exploitation of workers.</li>
<li><strong>Contingent Labor:</strong> The rise of temporary and insecure employment, creating a precarious workforce without benefits or long-term security.</li>
<li><strong>Lean Production:</strong> The relentless pursuit of efficiency and profit maximization at the expense of worker well-being and job satisfaction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto concludes by emphasizing that addressing these issues requires political action and a fundamental shift in societal values rather than relying solely on traditional education systems.
<ul>
<li>He urges his granddaughter to be an agent of change and fight for a more just and equitable society.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="schoolings-imperial-ambition">Schooling’s Imperial Ambition</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schooling’s Expansion:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Originating as a limited endeavor in colonial America (2 hours/day, a few months/year), schooling has steadily expanded its reach.</li>
<li>It now encroaches upon personal time and resists boundaries like summer vacation.</li>
<li>The concept of “<strong>lifelong learning</strong>” often translates to “lifelong schooling,” promoting the idea that more schooling is always the solution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Schooling as a False Solution:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto argues that societal issues (incoherence, aimlessness, incompetence, class hatred) often attributed to a lack of schooling are, in fact, exacerbated by it.</li>
<li>More schooling, he contends, cannot fix problems created by the institution itself.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Schooling’s Assault on Alternative Forms of Development:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Schooling undermines and seeks to supplant other vital sources of growth and learning:
<ul>
<li><strong>Family:</strong> Dismissed as a “retrograde institution” to be replaced by idealized, expert-designed models.</li>
<li><strong>Church:</strong> Seen as a threat to Gattoity of expert opinion and therefore targeted for removal.</li>
<li><strong>Tradition, Ethnic Loyalty, Loyalty to Place:</strong> Deemed obstacles to progress and slated for eradication.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This systematic dismantling of alternative influences, Gatto argues, cripples individual sovereignty, erodes ideals of liberty, and disrupts the natural transmission of knowledge and values across generations.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="schooling-vs.-education-key-distinctions">Schooling vs.&nbsp;Education: Key Distinctions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto presents several key distinctions between schooling and education:
<ul>
<li><strong>Source of Organization:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schooling:</strong> Controlled externally through command and control structures.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Self-directed and driven by internal motivation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Connection to Learning Sources:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schooling:</strong> Isolates students from diverse learning opportunities to maintain administrative efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Actively seeks out a rich network of connections – random, intentional, varied, and often unexpected – recognizing that resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and innovation thrive on diverse inputs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Role of Feedback:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schooling:</strong> Relies on external rules and evaluations, limiting opportunities for independent judgment and self-correction.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Emphasizes the crucial role of natural feedback loops. Students learn to attend to these loops, not to conform to external dictates, fostering self-reliance and personalized learning pathways.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Focus of Learning:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schooling:</strong> Prioritizes subject knowledge and specialization, aiming to produce efficient clerks for predefined roles within existing systems.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Values broad contexts and connections between disciplines, recognizing that true understanding and innovation often emerge from cross-fertilization of ideas.
<ul>
<li>Example: John Cancius, a non-specialist and college dropout, developed a breakthrough cancer treatment precisely because he wasn’t confined by specialized knowledge.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Approach to Knowledge:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schooling:</strong> Emphasizes memorization and acceptance of established truths, discouraging critical thinking.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Cultivates a state of internal debate and questioning, constantly seeking to challenge and refine existing knowledge.
<ul>
<li>This echoes Schumpeter’s concept of “<strong>creative destruction</strong>” – the driving force of capitalism – where questioning established norms and seeking better alternatives fuels progress.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact on Well-being:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto cites the <strong>International Happiness Survey</strong>, which consistently identifies three key factors for a happy life:
<ul>
<li>Good relationships.</li>
<li>Good health.</li>
<li>Satisfying work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Schooling, however, often undermines these factors:</strong>
<ul>
<li>It promotes unhealthy lifestyles and offers little support for developing strong relationships.</li>
<li>Tracking systems and segregation by background exacerbate class prejudice, hindering relationships across difference.</li>
<li>The work imposed rarely connects with the genuine interests and passions of young people.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> January 29, 2008</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Nuremberg, Germany</li>
<li><strong>Victim:</strong> Melissa Busekros, a 16-year-old girl</li>
<li><strong>Event:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Melissa is forcibly removed from her home by 15 police officers and city officials.</li>
<li>Her “crime” is homeschooling, a practice outlawed in Germany since 1937 under the Nazi regime.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Author’s Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li>He expresses his disgust by writing to the German ambassador in Washington, highlighting the disturbing parallels between contemporary Germany and its Nazi past.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Details of the Incident:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Despite no history of behavioral issues, Melissa is subjected to a 240-minute psychiatric interrogation focused solely on her reasons for homeschooling.</li>
<li>The interrogation concludes that Melissa suffers from “school phobia,” a dubious diagnosis used to justify the forceful intervention.</li>
<li>German authorities cite Melissa’s “delayed development” by one year as evidence of harm, despite lacking any internationally recognized standard for such assessment.</li>
<li>The court order authorizes the forceful removal of Melissa, deeming it necessary to protect her from her parents’ “illegal conduct” of homeschooling.</li>
<li>The German Education Authority vows to “bring convictions of the family into line,” employing language reminiscent of totalitarian regimes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Author’s Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>He questions the reasoning, philosophy, and values driving such extreme measures against a peaceful family exercising their right to choose an alternative educational path.</li>
<li>He draws parallels between this incident and Germany’s dark history of persecution, from witch hunts to the Holocaust, suggesting a dangerous pattern of suppressing individual liberty and enforcing conformity through state power.</li>
<li>He criticizes the German education system’s rigid adherence to rules and its stifling of individual initiative, citing the ThyssenKrupp steel plant debacle as evidence of its negative economic consequences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto’s letter to the German ambassador receives no reply.</li>

<li>Gatto is invited to speak at Highland High by school board member John Jankowicz, who is concerned about the negative effects of the school’s rigid, test-driven approach to education.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Observations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>He notes the affluence of the school and the students’ sense of entitlement, masking a deeper lack of intellectual curiosity and critical thinking skills.</li>
<li>He recognizes the pervasive climate of fear and dishonesty surrounding college admissions, used as a tool to control student behavior.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Talk:</strong>
<ul>
<li>He decides to address the students’ anxieties by deconstructing the myths surrounding college admissions, using real-world examples to challenge their assumptions.</li>
<li>He presents evidence that many successful individuals, including industry leaders, writers, and even politicians, did not conform to the traditional model of academic success.</li>
<li>He cites examples of college dropouts who have achieved extraordinary things, challenging the notion that elite college acceptance is the only path to a meaningful life.</li>
<li>He encourages students to question Gattoity of school officials and to demand transparency regarding their own educators’ academic records.</li>
<li>He shares information about the admission policies of prestigious universities, emphasizing that factors beyond grades and test scores, such as initiative, creativity, and real-world experience, are highly valued.</li>
<li>He presents Richard Branson’s entrepreneurial success as an example of a high school dropout who defied expectations and achieved extraordinary things.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Police Intervention:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In the midst of Gatto’s calm and factual presentation, a police detail suddenly enters the auditorium and orders everyone to leave.</li>
<li>The officer in charge uses a bullhorn to assert control, creating a deliberately intimidating atmosphere.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Aftermath:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto learns that the superintendent, McCarthy, deemed the talk “inflammatory” and called the police to shut it down.</li>
<li>This extreme reaction, despite Gatto’s calm demeanor and factual content, suggests a deep-seated resistance to any challenge of the established schooling narrative.</li>
<li>Gatto’s scheduled evening talk for parents is also canceled, further demonstrating the school’s determination to suppress dissenting views.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Media Coverage and Silence:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The local newspaper, the Mid-Hudson Highland Post, publishes a sanitized account of the incident, omitting any mention of the police intervention.</li>
<li>The superintendent falsely claims that Gatto showed a “violent film,” further highlighting the school’s dishonest attempts to control the narrative.</li>
<li>Gatto’s subsequent attempts to gather perspectives from the superintendent, principal, parents’ association, and student newspaper are met with complete silence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The incident at Highland High demonstrates the power of fear and control within the school system.</li>
<li>It shows how easily authorities can silence dissenting voices and suppress information that challenges the status quo.</li>
<li>The lack of transparency and accountability further reinforces the idea of a hidden agenda at work.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="incident-at-walden-crushing-local-control-and-common-sense">Incident at Walden: Crushing Local Control and Common Sense</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> 1991</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Walden, Vermont, a rural town with four historic one-room schoolhouses</li>
<li><strong>Event:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The state of Vermont threatens to close Walden’s beloved one-room schools, citing the cost of making them wheelchair accessible as prohibitive.</li>
<li>This is despite the schools’ strong academic performance, the community’s satisfaction, and the children’s evident well-being.</li>
<li>A plan is put forward to build a centralized concrete block school and bus students from up to 50 miles away.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Author’s Involvement:</strong>
<ul>
<li>He is invited to Walden to advocate for the preservation of the one-room schools.</li>
<li>He reviews the state’s proposal and finds the estimated costs for renovations to be grossly inflated.</li>
<li>He seeks expert testimony from a renowned architect familiar with construction costs in Vermont.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Expert Opinion and Fear:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The architect confirms that the state’s estimates are ten times higher than the actual cost, suggesting a deliberate attempt to mislead the community.</li>
<li>He reveals that the contract for the new school has likely already been promised to a specific firm, further highlighting the corruption at play.</li>
<li>However, the architect refuses to testify publicly, fearing professional repercussions from the state government.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Despite Gatto’s best efforts and the community’s desire to preserve their schools, the state’s repeated threats and the climate of fear prove too powerful.</li>
<li>Walden reluctantly approves the bond issue, goes into debt, and builds the centralized school, sacrificing their unique educational environment and sense of community control.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Walden incident demonstrates how a powerful entity like the state government can exploit its authority and financial leverage to impose its will on a community.</li>
<li>It highlights the corrupt practices often used to justify decisions made behind closed doors, benefiting select interests at the expense of local needs and desires.</li>
<li>The architect’s fear of speaking out reveals the insidious reach of such systems and the potential for silencing dissent even within professional circles.</li>

<section id="conclusion-the-urgent-need-for-subversion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-the-urgent-need-for-subversion">Conclusion: The Urgent Need for Subversion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto uses these three incidents to illustrate the pervasive and often hidden forces at play within the institution of schooling.</li>
<li>He argues that these forces prioritize control, conformity, and the maintenance of power over the genuine needs and well-being of students.</li>
<li>He concludes that true education requires a conscious effort to subvert the harmful aspects of schooling, to question its assumptions, and to seek out alternative paths to knowledge and personal fulfillment.</li>
<li>Gatto issues a call to action:
<ul>
<li>Recognize the dark side of schooling and its impact on individuals and society.</li>
<li>Actively resist its attempts to limit thinking, creativity, and individual potential.</li>
<li>Seek out alternative educational experiences that nurture curiosity, critical thinking, and a love of learning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto believes that by understanding and challenging the hidden agendas of schooling, individuals can reclaim their right to a meaningful and empowering education. He leaves the reader with the responsibility to carry on this fight:
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“But you’ll have to convince yourself of the substance of my allegation, that some sort of dark matter, some powerful but invisible force is at work in schooling. If you are to become strong enough to defend yourself and your family, I can’t do the work for you. You can’t memorize my conclusions.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Because you choose not to see the dark world school represents, because you only pay attention to its stupidities, it gets worse all the time.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Do I mean to imply that Highland School is the worst school in America? Hardly. For all I know, it is one of the best. Certainly it’s one of the richest. What you need to ask yourself is how many school districts from coast to coast find truth unbearable because it gets in the way of their real mission.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Unless the ends of the operation are put on public trial, and its sexual relationship with economics and social management exposed to the light and ended, each reform effort will only be another illusion, another room added to the National House of Mirrors.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Our government thinks some companies are too big to be allowed to fail, and that schooling is too important to allow education to get in its way.”</p>
</blockquote></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Destroy the standardized testing industry.</li>
<li><strong>Method:</strong> Open conspiracy with individuals acting as independent unit commanders.</li>
<li><strong>Reasoning:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Standardized testing is more damaging than beneficial to individuals and society.</li>
<li>Test destruction, not reform, is the only solution.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problems-with-standardized-testing">The Problems With Standardized Testing</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ineffectiveness:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Information generated is unreliable and misleading.</li>
<li>Data is unused in adult life.</li>
<li>No correlation between test performance and future success.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Damaging Effects:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Significant personal and social harm to students.</li>
<li>Ranking system creates winners and losers, fostering a sense of inferiority.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tool of Social Control:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Weaponized by social engineers to control institutional schooling.</li>
<li>Used to classify individuals as human resources.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Waste of Resources:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hundreds of millions of school days lost to test preparation, administration, and recovery.</li>
<li>Tens of billions of dollars diverted to private companies.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-outlaw-ethic-of-institutional-schooling">The Outlaw Ethic of Institutional Schooling</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> New York City Public Schools’ failure to provide mandated physical education.
<ul>
<li>Only 1 in 25 students receive the legal minimum of 24 minutes of physical education per day (New York Sun, May 8, 2008).</li>
<li>Parents concerned about lack of physical education, but have no significant voice in school decisions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consequences:</strong>
<ul>
<li>National epidemic of childhood obesity and diabetes.</li>
<li>Physical and psychological harm to students.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Institutional Hypocrisy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>NYC Board of Education claims to be “beginning to realize” the importance of student health after a century of control (New York Sun, May 8, 2008).</li>
<li>Schools continue to prioritize confinement over physical activity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Institutional schooling operates with an outlaw ethic, disregarding student well-being.</li>
<li>Schools will act against student and faculty interests under pressure.</li>

</section>
<section id="the-decline-of-american-education" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-decline-of-american-education">The Decline of American Education</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Post-World War II:</strong> Schooling replaced education.
<ul>
<li>Standardization based on the German model.</li>
<li>Standardized testing implemented and gradually gained importance (fully implemented by 1963).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>1950s:</strong> Curriculum dumbed down, teachers became less connected to the community.</li>
<li><strong>1960s:</strong> Test scores become the primary measure of excellence.</li>
<li><strong>1970s:</strong> Schools become a lucrative business, further incentivizing the status quo.
<ul>
<li>Eccentricity in teaching is persecuted.</li>
<li>Tracking systems solidify the division of students based on perceived ability.</li>
<li>Curriculum for affluent students is equivalent to that of working-class students in the 1940s-50s.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-assumption-of-inherent-inferiority">The Assumption of Inherent Inferiority</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prevalent Belief:</strong> The majority of the population is inherently incapable of intellectual growth beyond a mental age of 12.</li>
<li><strong>Proponents:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Abraham Lincoln ridiculed this view in 1859 (Richard Hofstadter’s <em>Anti-Intellectualism in American Life</em>).</li>
<li>Edward Thorndike, inventor of educational psychology at Columbia Teachers College.</li>
<li>H.H. Goddard, Chairman of the Psychology Department at Princeton.</li>
<li>James Bryant Conant, President of Harvard.</li>
<li>Major private foundations (e.g., Rockefeller, Carnegie).</li>
<li>Historical figures like Plato, John Calvin, Benedict Spinoza, Johann Fichte, Charles Darwin, and Francis Galton.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consequences:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Justification for limited educational expectations.</li>
<li>Acceptance of rigid social class systems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>American Exceptionalism (Pre-Civil War):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ordinary citizens controlled education.</li>
<li>Egalitarian ethic prevailed.</li>
<li>Self-education thrived, enabling social mobility.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Post-WWII Shift:</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Foundational Rights:</strong> American founding documents guarantee inalienable rights, including liberty, that are undermined by compulsory schooling.</li>
<li><strong>Need for Drastic Action:</strong> Revitalizing education requires a complete rejection of government control (Alexander Sholzhenitsyn, “How to Revitalize Russia,” <em>Pravda</em>, September 18, 1988).</li>
<li><strong>The Bartleby Solution:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Inspired by Herman Melville’s short story “Bartleby, the Scrivener” (1853).
<ul>
<li>Bartleby, a copyist, exercises passive resistance by responding to requests with, “I would prefer not to.”</li>
<li>This simple act disrupts the workplace and exposes the limitations of control.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Students are called upon to peacefully refuse standardized tests.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> 60 million American students.</li>
<li><strong>Messaging:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tests are unnecessary and harmful to education.</li>
<li>Students have the right to refuse.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Anticipated Challenges:</strong>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This book critiques the modern education system, arguing that it stifles curiosity and creativity in children. It advocates for a shift from instruction-based learning to a more engaging, game-like approach that empowers children to think independently, embrace failure, and develop a lifelong love of learning.</p>
<p>The author draws upon personal experience as a teacher and insights from various fields, including psychology, game design, and philosophy, to offer practical strategies for parents and educators to design a “Learning Game” that fosters genuine learning.</p>
<p>The book challenges common misconceptions about learning styles, the role of memorization, and the fear of failure, proposing alternative methods like story-driven learning, mental models, and elastic thinking.</p>

</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>This chapter, drawing upon John Taylor Gatto’s book “Dumbing Us Down,” outlines seven detrimental lessons ingrained in the traditional education system:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Confusion:</strong> Subjects taught in isolation, lacking real-world context, leaving students confused about how knowledge connects.
<ul>
<li><strong>Alternative:</strong> Teach concepts in context, applying them to solve problems or build projects.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Class Position:</strong> Obsession with ranking and labeling students, fostering competition instead of collaboration.
<ul>
<li><strong>Alternative:</strong> Encourage collaboration, letting kids define success on their own terms, valuing individual strengths and contributions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Indifference:</strong> Discouraging deep engagement by forcing rapid subject switching, mirroring the fragmented attention of the digital age.
<ul>
<li><strong>Alternative:</strong> Let kids follow their interests, allowing them to dive deep into topics that excite them, fostering focus and depth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Emotional Dependency:</strong> Students conditioned to mirror teachers’ emotions, hindering their ability to develop emotional regulation and resilience.
<ul>
<li><strong>Alternative:</strong> Encourage kids to explore and manage their own feelings, fostering emotional intelligence and resilience.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Intellectual Dependency:</strong> Prioritizing conformity and obedience over independent thought and challenging the status quo.
<ul>
<li><strong>Alternative:</strong> Encourage divergent thinking, questioning, and the development of individual perspectives, valuing critical thinking over rote memorization.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Provisional Self-Esteem:</strong> Tying self-worth to external validation from teachers and grades, rather than internal standards and self-assessment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Alternative:</strong> Encourage kids to develop an internal measuring stick, fostering self-confidence and self-reliance based on personal growth and effort.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Students Can’t Hide:</strong> Constant surveillance and lack of privacy, hindering experimentation, risk-taking, and the development of self-directed learning.
<ul>
<li><strong>Alternative:</strong> Provide opportunities for privacy, creative exploration, and independent action, allowing kids to learn through trial and error.</li>

</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>This chapter traces the historical development of the education system, revealing the origins of its flaws:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prussia:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The modern school system originated in Prussia, designed to create loyal, literate soldiers after their defeat by Napoleon.</li>
<li>This model emphasized standardized curriculum, teacher certification, and mandated attendance, prioritizing obedience and indoctrination.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The USA:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In the 20th century, the focus shifted from training soldiers to producing factory managers, leading to the adoption of the “factory model” in American schools.</li>
<li>This model emphasized standardization, efficiency, age-based grouping, specialized teachers, and long school days, mirroring the assembly line approach.</li>
<li>This model has yielded disappointing results, with stagnant test scores, declining public confidence, and a disconnect from real-world success.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This historical context reveals how the education system prioritizes state and industrial needs over genuine learning, leading to the current instruction-based model.</p>

<section id="chapter-3-how-tests-and-rewards-go-wrong" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chapter-3-how-tests-and-rewards-go-wrong">Chapter 3: How Tests and Rewards Go Wrong</h3>
<p>This chapter examines the detrimental effects of standardized testing and extrinsic rewards:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standardized Tests:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Initially designed to measure student progress, standardized tests have become the primary focus of education, leading to several negative consequences.</li>
<li>They create stressful learning environments, compromise mental health, do not accurately reflect real-world success, and incentivize cheating.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Extrinsic Rewards:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Schools rely on extrinsic rewards like pizza parties or prizes, offering short-term motivation but undermining long-term engagement.</li>
<li>Extrinsic motivators create dependence on external validation, hindering the development of intrinsic motivation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The chapter suggests alternative assessment methods, including portfolios and projects, and emphasizes the importance of intrinsic motivation, encouraging:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing choices and fostering accountability.</li>
<li>Involving children in decision-making.</li>
<li>Offering specific feedback that focuses on effort and the learning process, not just outcomes.</li>
<li>Engaging in “why” conversations to connect learning to real-world relevance and purpose.</li>
<li>Prioritizing fun and intrinsic enjoyment in the learning process.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chapter-4-lessons-to-unlearn-from-school">Chapter 4: Lessons to Unlearn from School</h3>
<p>This chapter highlights five counterproductive lessons learned in traditional school that need to be unlearned:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Fearing Mistakes:</strong> Shift from penalizing errors to embracing them as valuable learning opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Fitting In:</strong> Encourage individuality, divergent thinking, and “coloring outside the lines” over conformity and seeking validation through sameness.</li>
<li><strong>Waiting for Instructions:</strong> Cultivate problem-solving skills, resourcefulness, and the ability to learn independently without relying on constant direction.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Just in Case:</strong> Embrace “learning on demand,” where knowledge and skills are acquired as needed, driven by curiosity and real-world application.</li>
<li><strong>Fear of Questioning Authority:</strong> Foster critical thinking, challenging assumptions, and seeking evidence-based answers over blind acceptance of authority.</li>
</ol>

<section id="chapter-5-the-game-of-school" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chapter-5-the-game-of-school">Chapter 5: The Game of School</h3>
<p>This chapter contrasts the “game of school,” characterized by compliance and seeking external validation, with the “learning game,” emphasizing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Game of School:</strong> Mastering the system through superficial engagement, prioritizing grades over true understanding, and focusing on short-term performance.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Game:</strong> Embracing curiosity-driven exploration, taking ownership of the learning process, valuing the journey of discovery over external rewards.</li>
</ul>
<p>The chapter advocates for guiding children towards the learning game, fostering intrinsic motivation, and equipping them with the skills and mindset to become lifelong learners.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chapter-6-learning-to-love-learning">Chapter 6: Learning to Love Learning</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Separating Work and Play:</strong> Traditional education often separates learning from joy by framing schoolwork as “real work” and personal projects as mere play. This undermines the potential for genuine learning that blossoms when children are intrinsically motivated.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Personal Projects:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Personal projects, like building a tree house, offer opportunities for children to engage deeply in learning experiences they direct themselves. This mirrors the work of innovators like Darwin and Newton, whose successes stemmed from pursuing their own curiosities.</li>
<li>Examples like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Jenny Britton Bauer illustrate that groundbreaking achievements often arise from intensely pursuing personal passions, even if they fall outside traditional academic paths.</li>
<li><strong>Vuja De:</strong> Seeing a familiar situation with a fresh perspective that leads to new insights.</li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Rethinking Memorization in the Digital Age:</strong> With information readily accessible, rote memorization of isolated facts holds less importance. Instead, prioritize understanding fundamental concepts, developing critical thinking skills, and building a foundation of applicable knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pair Memory with Meaning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage understanding the “why” behind the “what.” Simply memorizing facts without comprehending their meaning limits genuine learning and the ability to apply knowledge effectively.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Focus on Essential Knowledge:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritize memorizing information with practical, real-world application over trivial facts easily retrieved online. Focus on concepts crucial for decision-making and understanding how the world works.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Effective Memorization Techniques:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Memory Palace:</strong> This technique leverages our natural ability to remember places and vivid imagery.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Imagine a familiar location (e.g., your childhood home).</li>
<li>Associate items to be memorized with specific locations within this “palace” (e.g., placing grocery items in different rooms).</li>
<li>Create unusual, memorable scenes involving these items (e.g., apples singing in the mailbox).</li>
<li>To recall the items, mentally walk through the “palace” and retrieve the vivid associations.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chapter-9-the-learning-style-myth">Chapter 9: The Learning Style Myth</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Challenging the Myth:</strong> The notion that individuals have one dominant learning style (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) lacks scientific support. Sensory modalities are interconnected, and we learn best by engaging multiple senses simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>Problems with Learning Styles:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Single Style:</strong> We do not have a single, fixed learning style. Preferences can vary depending on the context and the type of information being processed.</li>
<li><strong>Ineffective Customization:</strong> Tailoring teaching to supposed learning styles does not improve learning outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed Mindset:</strong> Labeling children as specific learner types can foster limiting beliefs about their abilities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Recommendations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debunk the Myth:</strong> Help children understand they don’t have just one learning style.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace Flexibility:</strong> Emphasize that learning preferences are adaptable and can change based on the situation.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage a Diverse Toolkit:</strong> Help children develop a range of learning strategies and encourage them to identify the most effective tools for different tasks.</li>

<p>Raising successful children requires a shift from traditional models. We must empower children to face challenges, make decisions, and develop resilience through skin in the game. Parents should actively engage in their children’s education, guiding them to cultivate both range and specific knowledge. By embracing failure and quitting as valuable learning opportunities, we can help children discover their passions, hone their unique talents, and ultimately lead fulfilling and impactful lives.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chapter-18-mental-models-for-parents">Chapter 18: Mental Models for Parents</h3>
<p>This chapter emphasizes the power of <strong>mental models</strong> in parenting.</p>
<p><strong>What are mental models?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mental models are generalized rules of thumb about how the world works, helping us make sense of our experiences.</li>
<li>They act like maps, enabling us to connect information, recognize patterns, and gain a broader perspective for better decision-making.</li>
<li>Mental models are essential for clear, rational, and effective thinking, and they are relevant in various disciplines.</li>
<li>We need a diverse set of mental models from multiple disciplines to understand and navigate the complexities of life.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why are mental models important for parents?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parenting presents constantly evolving challenges with children’s ever-changing needs and an overwhelming amount of (often conflicting) advice.</li>
<li>Mental models provide a framework for processing information, evaluating options, and responding effectively to children’s behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Five Mental Models for Parents:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Maslow’s Hammer:</strong> Avoid relying on a single parenting tactic (like a hammer seeing every problem as a nail). Children need diverse approaches as they grow and face new challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Reactance:</strong> Recognize that pressure often breeds resistance. Giving children autonomy and choices, rather than imposing our will, can be more effective.</li>
<li><strong>Nudges:</strong> Instead of just lecturing, create environments that naturally nudge children toward positive choices. For example, make healthy snacks more accessible than unhealthy ones.</li>
<li><strong>Reframing:</strong> Help children reframe challenges by shifting their perspective. Encourage them to find positive aspects or opportunities within difficult situations.</li>
<li><strong>Inversion:</strong> Teach children to approach problems by considering the opposite perspective (what they <em>don’t</em> want), then work backward to identify desirable actions.</li>
</ol>

</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Practice:</strong> Observe your child’s behavior for patterns, connect the dots with past experiences, and identify recurring themes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Document:</strong> Keep notes on your child’s behavior and your responses to recognize long-term trends and develop child-specific mental models.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use Checklists:</strong> Create checklists of strategies for common challenges, experiment to find what works, and update them as your child grows.</p></li>

</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Developed by Edward de Bono, the Six Thinking Hats encourage a well-rounded thinking process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>White Hat (Facts):</strong> Focuses on objective information, gathering data, and identifying what’s known and unknown.</li>
<li><strong>Red Hat (Emotions):</strong> Explores feelings, intuitions, and emotional responses related to the situation.</li>
<li><strong>Black Hat (Caution):</strong> Engages in critical thinking, identifying risks, flaws, and potential downsides.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow Hat (Optimism):</strong> Explores the positive aspects, benefits, and potential advantages.</li>
<li><strong>Green Hat (Creativity):</strong> Encourages brainstorming, out-of-the-box thinking, and exploring new possibilities.</li>
<li><strong>Blue Hat (Metacognition):</strong> Oversees the thinking process itself, monitoring progress, managing the use of other hats, and reflecting on the overall approach.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Benefits of Using the Six Thinking Hats:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broadened Perspective:</strong> Helps children see situations from multiple angles instead of fixating on a single viewpoint.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Decision-Making:</strong> Encourages consideration of various factors before reaching a conclusion.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Creativity:</strong> Promotes the generation of novel ideas and solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Wisdom:</strong> Develops the habit of thoughtful observation, careful consideration, and balanced judgment.</li>

<p>This section highlights the importance of probabilistic thinking and making decisions with the understanding that the future is uncertain:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid Resulting:</strong> Don’t judge the quality of a decision solely on its outcome, as luck plays a role. Instead, focus on the decision-making process itself.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lessons for Children:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Think in Probabilities:</strong> Encourage children to express likelihood in terms of percentages rather than absolutes. Help them understand that multiple outcomes are possible.</li>
<li><strong>Keep an Open Mind:</strong> Promote flexibility and adaptability in thinking. Encourage children to consider various perspectives and be open to changing their minds.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborate:</strong> Facilitate group discussions where children can challenge each other’s thinking, identify biases, and learn from different viewpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace Updates:</strong> Create a safe space for children to reflect on their decisions, acknowledge mistakes, and adjust their beliefs based on new information.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>John Taylor Gatto, a former New York State Teacher of the Year, argues that the American compulsory schooling system is inherently flawed, serving as a tool for social control and economic manipulation rather than genuine education.</p>
<p>He outlines seven harmful lessons instilled in students: confusion, class position, indifference, emotional dependency, intellectual dependency, provisional self-esteem, and constant surveillance.</p>
<p>Gatto advocates for a decentralized, community-based approach to education that prioritizes individual growth, self-reliance, and engagement with the real world, drawing inspiration from the successes of homeschooling and the historical model of colonial New England’s congregational principle.</p>
<p>He calls for radical reform, including decertification of teaching, privatization, and a return to family-centric learning.</p>

<section id="personal-background-and-influences" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="personal-background-and-influences">Personal Background and Influences</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto draws from his 30-year experience teaching in diverse NYC schools, from affluent Upper West Side to underprivileged Harlem.</li>
<li>His upbringing in Monongahela, Pennsylvania, a tight-knit, working-class town, instilled in him a strong sense of community and self-reliance.</li>
<li>Contrasting the values of his hometown with the impersonal nature of Manhattan fueled his critical perspective on societal structures.</li>
<li>His grandfather, the town printer and former newspaper publisher, fostered Gatto’s independent thinking and provided valuable life lessons.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="classroom-as-a-laboratory" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="classroom-as-a-laboratory">Classroom as a Laboratory</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto views his classrooms as spaces to observe and study the full spectrum of human potential and the factors that influence its expression.</li>
<li>He challenges the notion of intelligence as a normally distributed trait, having witnessed remarkable abilities in the most unexpected students.</li>
<li>This led him to question if the very structure of schooling, with its rigid schedules, constant monitoring, and lack of autonomy, stifles natural learning.</li>
</ul>

<section id="guerilla-exercises-to-empower-students" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="guerilla-exercises-to-empower-students">Guerilla Exercises to Empower Students</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto implements unconventional teaching methods that prioritize student freedom and self-directed learning:
<ul>
<li>Provides privacy and reduces surveillance</li>
<li>Offers choices in learning activities</li>
<li>Creates diverse learning environments and social interactions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He aims to empower students to become their own teachers and shape their own education.</li>

<section id="teaching-as-sculpture-not-painting" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="teaching-as-sculpture-not-painting">Teaching as Sculpture, Not Painting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto uses the analogy of sculpture to describe his teaching philosophy:
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional teaching:</strong> Like painting, it focuses on adding information onto a blank canvas (the student’s mind).</li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s approach:</strong> Like sculpting, it involves removing barriers that prevent inherent potential from emerging.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He shifted away from seeing himself as the expert filling empty vessels to recognizing the innate abilities within each child.</li>
</ul>

<section id="threats-to-the-system" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="threats-to-the-system">Threats to the System</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto believes his teaching philosophy poses two major threats:
<ul>
<li><strong>To the school system:</strong> It challenges the fundamental assumptions that underpin the institution, such as the perceived difficulty of learning.</li>
<li><strong>To the economy:</strong> It could produce critically thinking individuals who disrupt the existing economic order that relies on conformity and a fixed social hierarchy.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="principles-of-successful-teaching" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="principles-of-successful-teaching">Principles of Successful Teaching</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unconditional Trust:</strong> Allowing students to make mistakes and learn from them is crucial for self-mastery.</li>
<li><strong>Challenging Assumptions:</strong> Questioning traditional notions of valuable knowledge and a fulfilling life.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Individual Paths:</strong> Encouraging students to pursue their own unique interests and truths.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-invisible-curriculum-and-its-consequences" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-invisible-curriculum-and-its-consequences">The Invisible Curriculum and its Consequences</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto argues that compulsory schooling, despite its stated goals, promotes an “invisible curriculum” that:
<ul>
<li>Reinforces the legitimacy of the institution itself.</li>
<li>Prepares students for a society stratified by social class (caste).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He acknowledges his own complicity in perpetuating this system, even unintentionally.</li>

<section id="focusing-on-the-wrongs" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="focusing-on-the-wrongs">Focusing on the Wrongs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto aims to illuminate the flaws of the education system:
<ul>
<li><strong>What he does right:</strong> Getting out of the way of students’ natural curiosity and providing space, time, and respect.</li>
<li><strong>What he does wrong:</strong> Unintentionally reinforcing the hidden curriculum and hindering true learning.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="chapter-1-the-seven-lesson-schoolteacher" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chapter-1-the-seven-lesson-schoolteacher">Chapter 1: The Seven-Lesson Schoolteacher</h2>
<section id="introduction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This chapter stems from Gatto’s 1991 New York State Teacher of the Year acceptance speech, where he ironically highlights the seven damaging lessons he teaches, revealing the hidden curriculum of compulsory schooling.</p>
</section>
<section id="lesson-1-confusion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lesson-1-confusion">Lesson 1: Confusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto argues that schools teach information out of context, creating a fragmented and disconnected learning experience.</li>
<li>The curriculum lacks coherence and is overloaded with disparate subjects and activities, leaving students feeling overwhelmed and panicked.</li>
<li>The constant exposure to numerous, often unconnected, adults further contributes to confusion.</li>
<li>Schools prioritize superficial jargon over genuine enthusiasm and in-depth understanding.</li>
<li>This systematic confusion conditions students to accept it as their destiny, inhibiting their ability to seek meaning and make connections.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="lesson-2-class-position" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lesson-2-class-position">Lesson 2: Class Position</h3>
<ul>
<li>Schools enforce a rigid class system based on academic performance and standardized testing.</li>
<li>Students are numbered and categorized, discouraged from aspiring beyond their assigned class.</li>
<li>Gatto admits to using false promises of upward mobility through test scores to motivate students, perpetuating the illusion of meritocracy.</li>
<li>He acknowledges the incompatibility of truth and school teaching, highlighting how the system reinforces social stratification.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="lesson-3-indifference" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lesson-3-indifference">Lesson 3: Indifference</h3>
<ul>
<li>Schools cultivate indifference by demanding enthusiasm during lessons but enforcing detachment at the sound of the bell.</li>
<li>Students are conditioned to switch their emotions on and off, preventing them from fully engaging with any subject.</li>
<li>The bell system signals that no work is worth finishing, fostering a lack of care and follow-through.</li>
<li>This learned indifference prepares students for a world without meaningful work, perpetuating a cycle of apathy.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="lesson-4-emotional-dependency" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lesson-4-emotional-dependency">Lesson 4: Emotional Dependency</h3>
<ul>
<li>Schools train students to be emotionally dependent on external authority figures.</li>
<li>Rewards and punishments are used to control behavior and suppress individuality, teaching students to surrender their will to the established hierarchy.</li>
<li>Gatto emphasizes the absence of genuine rights within schools, replaced by privileges granted or revoked at the whim of authority.</li>
<li>This dependency extends to personal decisions, with teachers intervening and dictating acceptable behavior.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="lesson-5-intellectual-dependency" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lesson-5-intellectual-dependency">Lesson 5: Intellectual Dependency</h3>
<ul>
<li>The most crucial lesson taught is intellectual dependency, conditioning students to rely on experts for knowledge and meaning.</li>
<li>Students are discouraged from independent thought, learning to passively accept information as presented by teachers.</li>
<li>Curiosity is suppressed, replaced by conformity to prescribed thinking.</li>
<li>This dependency prepares students for a workforce that follows orders without questioning, perpetuating a system reliant on unquestioning obedience.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="lesson-6-provisional-self-esteem" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lesson-6-provisional-self-esteem">Lesson 6: Provisional Self-Esteem</h3>
<ul>
<li>Schools link self-esteem to external evaluations, fostering a dependence on expert opinion.</li>
<li>Constant grading, testing, and reporting create a culture of judgment and dissatisfaction, undermining students’ self-worth.</li>
<li>Gatto argues that the system benefits from perpetuating dissatisfaction, mirroring the consumerist economy’s reliance on manufactured needs.</li>
<li>Students are discouraged from trusting their own judgment and that of their parents, relying instead on the pronouncements of certified officials.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="lesson-7-one-cant-hide" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lesson-7-one-cant-hide">Lesson 7: One Can’t Hide</h3>
<ul>
<li>Schools create an environment of constant surveillance, denying students privacy and autonomy.</li>
<li>Students are encouraged to tattle on each other and even on their own families, fostering an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion.</li>
<li>Homework extends surveillance into the home, hindering independent learning and family time.</li>
<li>This constant monitoring teaches students that privacy is illegitimate and that authority figures are always watching, preparing them for a society under constant control.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Gatto argues that these seven lessons create a national curriculum that serves the interests of a centralized, hierarchical society at the expense of individual development and genuine education. He contends that this system is structurally unreformable, calling for a fundamental rethinking of educational approaches.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-social-crisis-and-the-school-crisis">The Social Crisis and the School Crisis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto links the crisis in American education to a larger social crisis marked by declining educational rankings, high rates of drug addiction, teenage suicide, and marriage instability.</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p><a href="https://ben.clavie.eu/">Ben Clavié</a> deconstructs the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and guides the audience through building a robust, basic RAG pipeline. He emphasizes that RAG is not a standalone technology, but a pipeline combining retrieval and generation, and each component needs individual attention for optimization. Ben advocates for a “MVP++” approach, incorporating essential elements like bi-encoders, re-ranking, keyword search (TF-IDF/BM25), and metadata filtering for a well-rounded system.</p>

<section id="demystifying-rag" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="demystifying-rag">Demystifying RAG</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>RAG: Overused and Misunderstood</strong>
<ul>
<li>The term “RAG” is often used incorrectly to represent an end-to-end system, creating confusion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>RAG as a Pipeline: Retrieval + Generation</strong>
<ul>
<li>RAG simply combines retrieval (finding relevant information) and generation (creating text) using Large Language Models (LLMs).</li>
<li>It’s not a single technology, but a pipeline requiring optimization at each stage: retrieval, generation, and their connection.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Importance of Identifying Specific RAG Issues</strong>
<ul>
<li>“My RAG doesn’t work” is too broad. Pinpointing the failing component (retrieval, LLM utilization) is crucial for debugging.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Real-World Data Has Context: Metadata Matters</strong>
<ul>
<li>Real-world documents often possess valuable metadata (e.g., author, date, department) that can significantly improve retrieval accuracy.</li>
<li>Pure Semantic or Keyword Search can struggle with metadata
<ul>
<li><strong>Example Query:</strong> “Can you get me the cruise division financial report for Q4 2022?”
<ul>
<li>Model must accurately represent all of “ﬁnancial report”, “cruise division”, “Q4” and “2022”, into a single vector
<ul>
<li>Otherwise it will fetch documents that look relevant but aren’t meeting one or more of those criteria.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If the number of documents you search for (“k”) is set too high, you will be passing irrelevant ﬁnancial reports to your LLM</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Entity Detection and Metadata Filtering: A Practical Example</strong>
<ul>
<li>Use entity detection models like GLiNER to automatically extract relevant metadata (e.g., document type, time period, department).</li>
<li><strong>GLiNER</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paper:</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08526">GLiNER: Generalist Model for Named Entity Recognition using Bidirectional Transformer</a></li>
<li><strong>GitHub Repository:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/urchade/GLiNER">GLiNER</a></li>
<li><strong>:hugs: Spaces Demo:</strong> <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/tomaarsen/gliner_medium-v2.1">GLiNER-medium-v2.1, zero-shot NER</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Filter documents based on extracted metadata to ensure relevance and reduce noise.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Storing and Using Metadata for Pre-filtering</strong>
<ul>
<li>Store metadata alongside documents in the database.</li>
<li>During retrieval, pre-filter documents based on query-specific metadata to narrow down the search space.</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fine-tuning-bi-encoders-and-cross-encoders">Fine-tuning Bi-Encoders and Cross-Encoders</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Q:</strong> Does the fine-tuning approach for bi-encoder models impact the fine-tuning of cross-encoder models and vice versa?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A:</strong> While domain-specific, generally aim for complementarity. Fine-tune bi-encoders for broader retrieval, capturing potential candidates. Rely on cross-encoders (re-rankers) for precise filtering and ranking.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="combining-bi-encoder-and-tf-idf-scores" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="combining-bi-encoder-and-tf-idf-scores">Combining Bi-Encoder and TF-IDF Scores</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a weighted average of bi-encoder and TF-IDF scores for selecting re-ranker questions compared to taking the top X from each ranker?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A:</strong> Both methods are valid and depend on the data. Weighted averages can be effective, but in domains like biomedicine, where document specificity is crucial, taking the top X from both ensures representation for potentially poorly embedded queries.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="rags-future-with-million-token-context-lengths" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rags-future-with-million-token-context-lengths">RAG’s Future with Million-Token Context Lengths</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Q:</strong> How will the emergence of million-token context lengths impact the relevance of RAG in the future?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A:</strong> RAG remains relevant even with extended context windows. Just as RAM doesn’t replace hard drives, large context windows won’t replace the need for efficient retrieval from vast external knowledge stores. Long context windows provide more flexibility in retrieval speed and allow for incorporating longer documents.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="chunking-strategies" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chunking-strategies">Chunking Strategies</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are your thoughts on different chunking strategies?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A:</strong> While LLMs for pre-chunking are promising but currently immature, maintaining semantic continuity within chunks is vital. The recommended approach is 300 tokens per chunk, avoiding sentence interruptions and including overlapping context (50 tokens) between consecutive chunks.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="fine-tuning-bi-encoders" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fine-tuning-bi-encoders">Fine-tuning Bi-Encoders</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Q:</strong> Should bi-encoders always be fine-tuned with labeled data or is it acceptable to use them off-the-shelf and rely on a re-ranker?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A:</strong> Fine-tuning encoders (both bi- and cross-) with labeled data consistently improves results. If data and resources are available, fine-tuning is highly recommended. However, for MVPs with limited resources, leveraging pre-trained models with re-ranking is a viable option.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Discussion:</strong> Clarifying the role of ColBERT in RAG pipelines.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>ColBERT as a First-Stage Retriever:</strong> Ideally replaces the bi-encoder in new pipelines, not used as a re-ranker.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ColBERT as a Re-Ranker:</strong> Can be used when pipeline changes are not feasible, but less optimal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ColBERT Overview:</strong> A bi-encoder variant where documents and queries are represented as bags of embeddings (one per token). This approach enhances out-of-domain performance due to its multi-vector representation, capturing more granular information.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can you describe the workflow for fine-tuning an embedding model?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Gather Data:</strong> Obtain queries and their corresponding relevant and non-relevant documents.</li>
<li><strong>Define Loss Function:</strong> Use a suitable loss function like <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2021/09/08/using-twin-neural-networks-to-train-catalog-item-embeddings/">triplet loss</a>, which leverages positive and negative examples to guide the model.</li>
<li><strong>Consider Hard Negatives:</strong> Enhance training by retrieving hard negatives—documents similar to positive examples but irrelevant to the query.</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis and Generation:</strong> Thoroughly analyze existing queries or generate synthetic ones using LLMs to augment training data.</li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Q:</strong> How do long context windows change the strategies and possibilities within RAG?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A:</strong> Long context windows enable:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Longer Documents:</strong> Incorporating longer documents or concatenated chunks into the context.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reduced Retrieval Overhead:</strong> Relaxing the reliance on highly precise retrieval (e.g., Recall@3) as more documents can fit within the context window. This allows for faster, less resource-intensive retrieval methods.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Demos:</strong> <a href="https://cohere.com/">Cohere</a>’s embedding models due to their API accessibility, performance, and affordability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Production:</strong> Multi-vector models like ColBERT are preferred.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>General Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Model Size:</strong> Stick to models with parameters between 100 million and 1 billion; larger LLMs as encoders often have unfavorable latency-performance trade-offs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid Overly Large Models:</strong> Using excessively large LLMs for embedding can lead to diminishing returns in performance and increased latency.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Hybrid Approach:</strong> Use Elasticsearch’s BM25 capabilities for initial retrieval and integrate a separate re-ranking pipeline (potentially using a cross-encoder).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vector Database Integration:</strong> Leverage Elasticsearch’s vector database offerings to incorporate semantic search capabilities.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>OOM errors are a common challenge when working with large PyTorch models.</li>
<li>Traditional solutions like reducing batch size or model size are limited in effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="understanding-model-memory" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="understanding-model-memory">Understanding Model Memory</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>VRAM Constraint:</strong> Modern GPUs have limited VRAM (e.g., 24GB for 3090s and 4090s), leading to challenges when training large models.</li>
<li><strong>Model Memory Components:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parameters:</strong> Model weights, typically stored in FP16 (2 bytes per parameter). For a 7B parameter LLaMa model, this translates to 14GB.</li>
<li><strong>Gradients:</strong> Calculated during backpropagation, require the same storage size as parameters (another 14GB for LLaMa 7B).</li>
<li><strong>Optimizer State:</strong> Optimizers like Adam store additional information, often twice the size of parameters (28GB for LLaMa 7B).</li>
<li><strong>Activations:</strong> Intermediate outputs of model layers.
<ul>
<li>The size is harder to estimate and depends on factors like batch size and context length.</li>
<li>Activations tend to dominate memory usage at larger batch sizes and context lengths.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> A full fine-tuning of a 7B parameter LLaMa model can easily exceed 56GB (14GB parameters + 14GB gradients + 28GB optimizer state), exceeding the VRAM capacity of most consumer GPUs.</li>
<li><strong>Forum Post:</strong> <a href="https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/how-to-measure-memory-usage-from-your-model-without-running-it/2024/1">How to measure memory usage from your model without running it?</a></li>

<section id="optimizer-memory" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="optimizer-memory">Optimizer Memory</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paper:</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980">Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization</a></li>
<li>While alternative optimizers like SGD might seem appealing due to their lower memory overhead, Adam remains dominant in practice due to its effectiveness.</li>
<li>Replacing Adam is challenging and might not yield significant memory savings.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="parameter-quantization" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="parameter-quantization">Parameter Quantization</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>4-bit Quantization:</strong> Reduces the precision of model parameters from FP16 to INT4 (half a byte per parameter).</p></li>
<li><p>This technique can significantly reduce memory footprint, for example, bringing the size of a 7B parameter LLaMa model down from 14GB to 3.5GB.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Torch Compile:</strong> This tool can be leveraged to create efficient quantization kernels directly from Python code, eliminating the need for custom CUDA kernels.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gradient-optimization-with-lora">Gradient Optimization with LoRA</h3>
<ul>
<li>Directly quantizing gradients to 4-bit negatively impacts convergence.</li>
<li><strong>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA):</strong> Circumvents this issue by training only a small subset of parameters (adapters) while keeping the majority frozen.</li>
<li><strong>QLoRA:</strong> This technique combines LoRA with parameter quantization to achieve significant memory savings without compromising accuracy.</li>

<section id="challenges-and-solutions-with-qlora" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenges-and-solutions-with-qlora">Challenges and Solutions with QLoRA</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>QLoRA implementation can be complex, often requiring custom CUDA kernels (e.g., the original implementation by Tim Detmers consists of 4,000 lines of CUDA code).</p>
<ul>
<li>Weights aren’t in int4 but NF4 which is closer to a normal distribution</li>
<li>Can’t matrix multiply NF4 tensors
<ul>
<li>need to dequantize and matmul</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can’t use the same max for everything otherwise you’re too sensitive to outliers</li>
<li>Quantization typically done in blocks with independent scales</li>
<li>QLoRA quantizes the scales (double quantization)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Simplified Implementation with Torch Compile:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/drisspg">Driss Guessous</a>, a PyTorch developer, implemented QLoRA in approximately 900 lines of Python code using Torch Compile.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code:</strong> <a href="https://www.github.com/torchao/dtypes/nf4tensor.py">torchao/dtypes/nf4tensor.py</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Tensor Subclasses:</strong> PyTorch’s tensor subclassing feature enables the creation of custom data types like NF4 (used in QLoRA), allowing for more efficient representation and manipulation of quantized tensors.</p>

<section id="identifying-the-root-causes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="identifying-the-root-causes">Identifying the Root Causes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Root Cause 1: Configuration Discrepancy</strong>
<ul>
<li>TorchTune recipe LoRA-fied to the output projection (adding two low rank adapters per layer), resulting in 64 additional parameters compared to train.py.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Root Cause 2: Tensor Subclass Dispatch Overhead</strong>
<ul>
<li>Distributed tensors (D-tensors) introduce overhead due to metadata unwrapping during kernel calls.</li>
<li>This overhead was amplified by the increased number of parameters, making the optimizer step significantly slower in FSDP2.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section id="addressing-the-discrepancies-and-further-benchmarking" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="addressing-the-discrepancies-and-further-benchmarking">Addressing the Discrepancies and Further Benchmarking</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ensuring Apples-to-Apples Comparison:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Standardized the dataset, parameter count, and wrapping policy across benchmarks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Results After Standardization:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Still slower runtime for FSDP2.</li>
<li>Significantly improved peak memory usage.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Further Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Focused on forward pass, backward pass, and optimizer as the main culprits for the remaining performance gap.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="deep-dive-into-performance-gaps" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deep-dive-into-performance-gaps">Deep Dive into Performance Gaps</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gap 1: Optimizer Step Slowdown</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem:</strong> D-tensor overhead resulted in a 3x slower optimizer step.</li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> Collaborated with Intel to develop a fused Adam optimizer kernel for single dispatch and vectorization, leading to an 8x speedup.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gap 2: Larger All Gather Operations</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem 1:</strong> FSDP2 packed more data (scalars and quantization factors) into the all gather operation, unlike the baseline.</li>
<li><strong>Problem 2:</strong> Output projection wasn’t quantized in FSDP2 when opting out of LoRA, leading to a 4x larger size compared to the baseline.</li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Problem 1 is expected behavior.</li>
<li>Problem 2 will be addressed by TorchTune in future releases.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gap 3: Overhead from Dequantization</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem:</strong> FSDP2’s dequantization process from NF4 to BF16 for CUDA kernels was less efficient than the specialized implementation used in the baseline.</li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> Explore using Torch Compile, custom Torch kernels, or Triton kernels for faster dequantization.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gap 4: Different Rope Algorithms</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem:</strong> TorchTune and the baseline employed different Rope algorithms, leading to different operations before the SDPA.</li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> TorchTune to offer a wider selection of Rope algorithms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gap 5: Overlapping Communication and Computation</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem:</strong> FSDP2’s stricter memory management exposed inefficiencies in overlapping CPU offloading with computation. The computation tasks were much smaller than the communication tasks, leading to idle time.</li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> Adjusted the wrapping policy to group layers differently, enabling better overlap and reducing idle time. This solution is only feasible with FSDP2 due to its ability to handle mixed precision within a layer.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="performance-observations-fine-tuning-vs.-rag">Performance Observations: Fine-tuning vs.&nbsp;RAG</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>RAG often outperforms fine-tuning:</strong> Several studies indicate that RAG, even without fine-tuning, often achieves comparable or better performance than fine-tuning alone, especially for larger models and knowledge-based tasks.
<ul>
<li><strong>Forum Post:</strong> <a href="https://community.openai.com/t/fine-tuning-vs-context-injection-rag/550286/1">Fine-tuning vs Context-Injection (RAG)</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Prioritization over “versus”:</strong> While combining RAG and fine-tuning can yield incremental improvements, prioritizing RAG is crucial due to its efficiency and effectiveness.
<ul>
<li><strong>Paper:</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01432">Fine Tuning vs.&nbsp;Retrieval Augmented Generation for Less Popular Knowledge</a></li>
<li><strong>Paper:</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05934">Fine-Tuning or Retrieval? Comparing Knowledge Injection in LLMs</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fine-tuning for style, not knowledge:</strong> Fine-tuning might be less suitable for incorporating domain knowledge into a model compared to RAG, which directly provides relevant context.
<ul>
<li><strong>Paper:</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08406">RAG vs Fine-tuning: Pipelines, Tradeoffs, and a Case Study on Agriculture</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The evolving definition of “knowledge”:</strong> Distinguishing between “knowledge” and “style” in LLMs is complex and changes with each model generation. What previously required fine-tuning (e.g., writing style) might be achievable through prompting in newer models.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="qa-on-fine-tuning-rag-and-knowledge">Q&amp;A on Fine-tuning, RAG, and Knowledge</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fine-tuning effectiveness and model size:</strong> Fine-tuning might be more beneficial for smaller models compared to larger ones, which are already more capable of learning from context.</li>
<li><strong>Domain-specific knowledge and RAG:</strong> Even for smaller models, RAG remains crucial for tasks involving domain-specific knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluating fine-tuning success:</strong> The choice of evaluation metric significantly impacts the perceived effectiveness of fine-tuning. For tasks like style adherence, fine-tuning might appear more beneficial than RAG.</li>
<li><strong>The blurry line between style and content:</strong> The distinction between “style” and “content” can be ambiguous, making it difficult to definitively determine when fine-tuning is beneficial.</li>
</ul>

<section id="audience-questions-and-examples-of-fine-tuning-success" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="audience-questions-and-examples-of-fine-tuning-success">Audience Questions and Examples of Fine-tuning Success</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complex knowledge bases and fine-tuning:</strong> When dealing with large, curated knowledge bases, it’s crucial to evaluate whether the next generation of LLMs, combined with RAG, might be sufficient without fine-tuning.</li>
<li><strong>Adding knowledge via prompting and RAG:</strong> In many cases, adding knowledge to the model can be achieved through prompting, RAG, or a combination of both, eliminating the need for fine-tuning.</li>
<li><strong>Fine-tuning for multilingual models:</strong> Fine-tuning might be beneficial for improving the performance of multilingual models on languages with limited training data, as it leverages the model’s existing understanding of language mapping.</li>
<li><strong>Fine-tuning for code generation:</strong> While fine-tuning can be used to adapt code generation models to specific styles and conventions, RAG remains highly effective for providing codebase context.</li>
<li><strong>Contextual learning vs.&nbsp;fine-tuning:</strong> LLMs are demonstrating impressive abilities to learn from context, potentially replacing the need for fine-tuning in scenarios where sufficient context can be provided.</li>

<section id="the-moving-target-fine-tuning-and-frontier-models" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-moving-target-fine-tuning-and-frontier-models">The Moving Target: Fine-tuning and Frontier Models</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rapid LLM advancements:</strong> The rapid pace of LLM development makes fine-tuning a moving target, as newer models often surpass the performance of previously fine-tuned models.</li>
<li><strong>Bloomberg GPT example:</strong> Bloomberg GPT, a large language model pre-trained on financial data, initially outperformed existing models on financial tasks. However, its performance was subsequently surpassed by newer models like GPT-4.
<ul>
<li><strong>Paper:</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17564">BloombergGPT: A Large Language Model for Finance</a></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-difficulty-of-fine-tuning-prioritizing-fundamentals">The Difficulty of Fine-tuning: Prioritizing Fundamentals</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The 80/20 rule of ML:</strong> Similar to traditional ML, most effort in LLM development should be dedicated to data work (80%), followed by engineering (18%), debugging (2%), and architecture research (0%).</li>
<li><strong>Fine-tuning as a last resort:</strong> Fine-tuning should only be considered after thoroughly addressing fundamentals like data quality, evaluation, prompting, and RAG.</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchy of needs:</strong> Prioritize building a solid ML system with robust evaluation, prompting, and RAG before attempting to fine-tune.

<li><strong>Dataset:</strong> <a href="argilla/distilabel-intel-orca-dpo-pairs">argilla/distilabel-intel-orca-dpo-pairs</a></li>
<li><strong>Why it’s cool and what you can learn:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Filtering: less is more</li>
<li>Choosing the “stronger” model as always chosen doesn’t always work</li>
<li>Doing some data focused work using humans can make a big impact on model performance</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dataset:</strong> <a href="jondurbin/gutenberg-dpo-v0.1">jondurbin/gutenberg-dpo-v0.1</a></li>
<li><strong>Approach:</strong> Uses human-written books and LLM-generated summaries to create a DPO dataset for improving LLM writing ability.</li>

<li><p><strong>PlatVR KTO Dataset</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dataset:</strong> <a href="ITG/PlatVR-kto">ITG/PlatVR-kto</a></li>
<li><strong>Approach:</strong> Collects thumbs up/down ratings on model outputs to create a KTO dataset for a vision-language task.</li>
<li><strong>Why it’s cool and what you can learn:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Example of how KTO datasets can work well as a data flywheel</li>
<li>Users submit a prompt. They get a response they 👍/👎 that response</li>
<li>Cheap to collect and can be useful data even if you don’t end up using KTO</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The creation process was done using a crowdsourcing methodology. Therefore, the preferences in the data align with the user group that participated in the process (i.e., these are real preference data).</li>

<pre class="text"><code>'Fine-tuning is a common practice in deep learning, where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a downstream task.\nIn this paper, we show that fine-tuning is all you need for a wide range of tasks.\nWe propose a simple yet effective fine-tuning recipe that works well for both vision and language tasks.\nOur recipe includes a learning rate warmup stage, a cosine learning rate decay schedule, and a stochastic weight averaging (SWA) stage.\nWe show that our recipe can significantly improve the performance of fine-tuning on a wide range of tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and language understanding.\nWe also show that our recipe can improve the performance of fine-tuning on small datasets, where the performance of fine-tuning is usually worse than training from scratch.\nOur recipe is simple and easy to implement, and we hope it will be useful for the deep learning community.'</code></pre>

<pre class="text"><code>Kathleen Passidomo, a Naples Republican, has been named the Senate's majority leader for the upcoming legislative session by incoming Florida Senate President Bill Galvano. Passidomo was impressed with the appointment because of her good rapport with both Senate Republicans and Democrats and her ability to build consensus. Passidomo agrees that her people skills will be key in shaping the Senate agenda for the coming session, which begins on March 5. Committee meetings will start on December 11. Although the legislative priorities will be the same as last year, including water quality and mental health. In a message to other senators, Galvano praised Passidomo's ability to not only extract favorable consideration from other senators but to maintain the respect of the members. Committee chairmen recognize leadership's ability to guide the Senate to a top spot now sets Passidomo up for even greater things in the future.

<pre class="text"><code>1. The article starts with a repetitive sentence, "Incoming Florida Senate President Bill Galvano named the Naples Republican the Senate's majority leader for the upcoming legislative session." This can be simplified to avoid repetition.
2. The use of informal language, such as "you can put my office in the men's room for all I care," detracts from the article's professional tone.
3. The article uses indirect speech in some instances, such as "What he was saying is that he was naming her senate majority leader," which can be replaced with direct speech for clarity and conciseness.
4. The sentence "Galvano says he picked Passidomo for the post because she has a good rapport with both Senate Republicans and Democrats and is a consensus builder" can be rephrased to avoid redundancy.
5. The use of parentheses in the sentence "Most of it (the job) is member relations, helping members get their bills heard" can be avoided by rephrasing the sentence.
6. The sentence "The Senate majority leader only gets one vote, just like other senators, so what's the upside for constituents?" can be rephrased to avoid the use of a question and make it more assertive.
7. The sentence "That table includes the Senate president, president pro tempore, in this case Sen. David Simmons, Passidomo as majority leader and perhaps one or two others" can be rephrased for clarity.
8. The sentence "Traditionally, legislators in leadership positions don't file as many bills as rank and file members" can be rephrased to avoid the use of "don't" and make it more assertive.
9. The sentence "Some recent predecessors in the post haven't filed any" can be rephrased to avoid the use of "haven't" and make it more assertive.
10. The sentence "In a message to other senators, Galvano praised Passidomo's efforts on the latter" can be rephrased to avoid the use of "the latter" and make it more precise.
11. The sentence "The role of the Senate majority leader isn't to extract favorable consideration from other senators" can be rephrased to avoid the use of "isn't" and make it more assertive.
12. The sentence "Being named to a top spot now sets Passidomo up for even greater things in the future" can be rephrased to avoid the use of "sets up" and make it more assertive.
13. The sentence "Assuming she keeps her seat in the 2022 election and Republicans maintain control of the Senate in 2022 and beyond, she could be Senate president herself in the session that follows" can be rephrased for clarity and conciseness.
14. The sentence "Passidomo said she was taken by surprise by her sudden promotion" can be rephrased to avoid the use of "was taken by surprise" and make it more assertive.
15. The sentence "Third floor, to be exact" can be avoided as it does not add any significant information to the article.</code></pre>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recap-on-loras">Recap on LoRAs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)</strong>: A parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that introduces small adapter matrices into the model’s layers, significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to full fine-tuning.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits of LoRA</strong>: Reduced memory requirements during training and deployment, enabling fine-tuning on consumer-grade hardware and efficient serving of multiple adapters.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment Options</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep LoRA separate</strong>: Store LoRA weights in a separate file and load them during inference.</li>
<li><strong>Merge LoRA with base model</strong>: Combine the learned LoRA weights with the original model weights into a single file.</li>
<li><strong>Hot-swapping adapters</strong>: Dynamically load and unload adapters on demand, sharing the base model among multiple adapters.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Key Trade-off</strong>: Balancing performance (latency and throughput) with cost (GPU usage and idle time).</li>
<li><strong>Factors Influencing Performance and Cost</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>GPU speed:</strong> More powerful GPUs offer lower latency but are more expensive.</li>
<li><strong>Model size:</strong> Larger models generally perform better but require more resources and time.</li>
<li><strong>Engineering optimizations:</strong> Platform-level optimizations can improve efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Cold start vs.&nbsp;idle time:</strong> Loading models onto GPUs takes time (cold start), but keeping them loaded incurs idle time cost.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hot-swapping adapters</strong>: A strategy to mitigate the cold start vs.&nbsp;idle time trade-off by serving multiple LoRAs on the same GPU, ensuring consistent traffic and reducing idle time.</li>

<li><strong>Textbook:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Massively-Parallel-Processors-Hands/dp/0323912311/">Programming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach</a></li>
<li>GPUs have much larger areas dedicated to processing units (ALUs) compared to CPUs, which prioritize caching and control flow for lower latency.</li>
<li>This design difference allows GPUs to achieve significantly higher memory throughput, making them suitable for high-throughput tasks like LLM inference.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="llm-inference-challenges" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="llm-inference-challenges">LLM Inference Challenges</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Throughput</strong>: Easily scalable by increasing batch size (with some latency tradeoffs).</li>
<li><strong>Latency</strong>: Much harder to optimize.
<ul>
<li><strong>Techniques for Improvement</strong>: Quantization, model distillation, truncation, faster hardware, and highly optimized software (e.g., CUDA kernels).</li>
<li><strong>Extreme Latency Optimization</strong>: Running models entirely on cache memory (SRAM), as done by <a href="https://wow.groq.com/lpu-inference-engine/">Groq’s LPU</a>, significantly reduces latency but may impact throughput per dollar.</li>
