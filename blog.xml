<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome back to this series on real-time object detection with YOLOX. So far, this series has covered how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finetune a YOLOX model in PyTorch to detect hand signs.</li>
<li>Export the finetuned model to ONNX.</li>
<li>Use the ByteTrack object tracker to track objects across video frames.</li>
<li>Quantize the model with ONNX Runtime and TensorRT for int8 inference on NVIDIA hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>This post builds on those past tutorials by walking through deploying our model on an NVIDIA <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-orin-nano-devkit">Jetson Orin Nano</a> developer kit to perform real-time object tracking from a camera feed. Additionally, we will use ONNX Runtime’s TensoRT execution provider to leverage the Jetson’s Tensor Cores.</p>
<p>Released in 2023, the Jetson Orin Nano is NVIDIA’s entry-level single-board computer and offers a balance of performance and power efficiency for edge AI applications. Its compact form factor and robust inference capabilities make it a suitable platform for deploying real-time object-tracking systems in various scenarios, from human-computer interaction to industrial automation.</p>
<p>Whether you’re working with the pre-trained hand-sign detection model used in this series or a custom model, real-time object tracking on the Jetson Orin Nano opens up many possibilities for edge applications.</p>
</section>
<section id="prerequisites" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>This tutorial is for Jetson devices loaded with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack-sdk-60">Jetpack 6</a>. You can follow the official guide from NVIDIA to ensure your Jetson is ready.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-orin-nano-devkit">Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit Getting Started Guide</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The code for this tutorial assumes the Jetson device has either a USB or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_Serial_Interface">CSI</a> Camera attached. While a USB camera will work, a CSI Camera is preferable due to the improved frame rate and latency.</p>
<p>The Jetson Orin Nano devkit has 22-pin MIPI CSI camera connectors. If your CSI camera module uses a 15-pin connector, you will need a 15-pin to 22-pin adapter cable. You can order a pack of 3 on Amazon at the link below:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="setting-up-a-python-environment">Setting Up a Python Environment</h2>
<p>With our Jetson device prepared, we can set up a Python environment to run the demo code.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="install-mamba-package-manager">Install Mamba Package Manager</h3>
<p>As with previous tutorials in this series, we will use the Mamba package manager to create and manage our Python environment.</p>
<p>Run the following bash commands on the Jetson to download the latest release, install it, and relaunch the current bash shell to apply the relevant changes:</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="install-opencv-dependencies">Install OpenCV Dependencies</h3>
<p>As with the <a href="../byte-track/">earlier object-tracking tutorial</a>, we will use the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/"><code>opencv-python</code></a> package to obtain input for our model. Since we are on a Jetson, we must build the package with support for USB and CSI Camera input enabled.</p>
<p>To do that, we must install some dependencies:</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="install-onnx-runtime">Install ONNX Runtime</h3>
<p>Next, we will install ONNX Runtime to use its TensorRT Execution Provider. The <a href="../ort-tensorrt-ubuntu/">previous tutorial</a> that utilized this execution provider used the dedicated <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tensorrt/">tensorrt pip package</a>. This time, we will use the version of TensorRT that comes with Jetpack 6.</p>
<p>According to NVIDIA’s <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack-sdk-60">release page</a> for Jetpack 6, it comes with CUDA 12.2 and TensorRT 8.6.</p>
<p>Looking at ONNX Runtime’s <a href="https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/TensorRT-ExecutionProvider.html#requirements">documentation</a>, we can see that we need ONNX Runtime 1.17 for those versions of CUDA and TensorRT.</p>
<p>We can download a pre-built Python 3.10 wheel for ONNX Runtime 1.17 from the webpage linked below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://elinux.org/Jetson_Zoo#ONNX_Runtime">Jetson Zoo: ONNX Runtime</a></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="define-a-wrapper-class-for-reading-camera-frames">Define a Wrapper Class for Reading Camera Frames</h3>
<p>When testing the demo using OpenCV’s <code>VideoCapture</code> class directly, I noticed a delay between the input to the camera (e.g., me waving my hand) and what showed on the preview window.</p>
<p>This lag only occurred when performing inference, and the delay increased at higher framerates. It was as if there were a frame queue that built up faster than the Jetson could process.</p>
<p>This effect is not necessarily a problem, depending on the application. However, I found it annoying, so I used the following solution to get around it. It is essentially a wrapper for the <code>VideoCapture</code> class that helps ensure we only work with the most recent frame from the camera.</p>

<li>The class employs threading to read frames in the background, enhancing processing efficiency.</li>
<li>The class utilizes the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html">queue</a> module to manage frames safely across threads.</li>
<li>A separate thread executes the <code>_reader</code> method, which continuously reads frames and manages the queue.</li>
<li>When the queue reaches capacity, the class discards the oldest frame to accommodate the newest one. This approach ensures the availability of the most recent frame for processing.</li>
<li>The main video processing loop accesses frames from the queue through the <code>read</code> method.</li>
<li>The release method stops the thread and frees up resources once the program finishes with video capture.</li>
</ol>
<p>That takes care of the utility code.</p>

<p>At last, we can initialize our video capture and tracker objects and implement our video processing loop.</p>
<section id="overview" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>The following code sets up a video capture system, supporting either a CSI camera or a V4L2 camera based on the <code>use_csi</code> flag.</li>
<li>It creates a <code>FrameDropper</code> object to manage video capture.</li>
<li>The code initializes a <code>BYTETracker</code> for object tracking.</li>
<li>Inside a main processing loop, the system continuously:
<ul>
<li>Captures frames from the video feed</li>
<li>Prepares each frame for inference</li>
<li>Runs the ONNX model to detect objects</li>
<li>Processes the model outputs to generate object proposals</li>
<li>Applies non-max suppression to filter overlapping detections</li>
<li>Updates the tracker with new detections</li>
<li>Matches detections with existing tracks</li>
<li>Annotates the frame with bounding boxes and tracking IDs</li>
<li>Calculates and displays the current FPS</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The code uses OpenCV to create a window and display the annotated frames in real-time.</li>
<li>It implements an exit mechanism, listening for a ‘q’ key press to stop the processing loop.</li>
<li>Finally, the code ensures proper resource cleanup by releasing the video capture and closing all windows when the program terminates.</li>

<section id="an-inside-joke" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-inside-joke">An Inside Joke</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The term “atomic,”</strong> while outdated in the context of nuclear technology, persists due to its historical charm and literary origins.</li>
<li><strong>Frederick Soddy’s 1909 book, “Interpretation of Radium,”</strong> detailed the discovery of energetic rays emitted during the disintegration of radium.
<ul>
<li>Soddy and Rutherford confirmed the existence of these rays.</li>
<li>Marie Curie, the discoverer of radium, named this energy “radiation.”</li>
<li>Rutherford jokingly suggested the possibility of triggering a chain reaction of disintegration in a radioactive metal, causing a massive explosion.</li>
<li>Soddy dismissed the idea as fantasy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>H.G. Wells’ 1914 novel, “The World Set Free,”</strong> was inspired by Soddy’s book.
<ul>
<li>Wells, a renowned science fiction author known for works like “The Time Machine” and “The War of the Worlds,” envisioned a future world war involving powerful bombs.</li>
<li>These bombs, dubbed <strong>“atomic bombs,”</strong> utilized radioactive decay as their explosive mechanism and could destroy entire cities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Wells’ description of the atomic bomb’s technology was fictional and nonsensical:</strong>
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Those used by the Allies were lumps of pure carolinum, painted on the outside with unoxidized sidenator-inducive enclosed hermetically in a case of membranium, A little celluloid stud between the handles by which the bomb was lifted was arranged so as to be easily torn off and admit air to the inducive, which at once became active and set up radioactivity in the outer layer of the Carolinum sphere. This liberated fresh inducive, and in a few minutes the whole bomb was a blazing continual explosive.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Despite the inaccurate science, the book gained popularity among some technologists and nuclear scientists.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Wells accurately predicted that artificially induced radioactivity would be achieved by 1933.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Leo Szilard, a Hungarian physicist, read Wells’ book in 1932 and was inspired to explore nuclear chain reactions.</strong>
<ul>
<li>He solved the problem of self-sustained nuclear fission in 1933 and filed a patent for the nuclear reactor in 1934.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>By World War II, the term “atomic” had become scientifically outdated.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Rutherford’s discovery of the nucleus in 1911 revealed that radiation originated from nuclear decay, not atomic processes.</li>
<li><strong>Atomic processes,</strong> such as chemical reactions, involve the electron clouds surrounding the nucleus, while <strong>nuclear binding forces</strong> are the source of radiation and a far greater energy source.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>During the secretive wartime nuclear research, descriptive terms were avoided in favor of code names.</strong>
<ul>
<li>The test bomb in New Mexico was called “the Gadget.”</li>
<li>The Hiroshima bomb was “Little Boy,” and the Nagasaki bomb was “Fat Man.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The term “Atomic Bomb” was adopted for the wartime nuclear weapons as a nod to H.G. Wells’ fictional creation, becoming an inside joke.</strong></li>
<li><strong>After the war, the term “atomic bomb” entered the public domain, popularized by the revelation of the Manhattan Project.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The United States Congress established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in 1946, officially adopting the outdated term.</strong>
<ul>
<li>The AEC was replaced by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1974.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The term “atomic” persists in the names of several international organizations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Japanese Atomic Energy Commission</li>
<li>Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission</li>
<li>Atomic Energy Commission of India</li>
<li>Commissariat à l’énergie atomique of France</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose of the book:</strong> Not to promote nuclear power, but to provide a clear history and understanding of its development and inevitability.</li>
<li><strong>Early perceptions of nuclear energy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sparked by a perceived energy crisis in 1939.</li>
<li>Douglas W. F. Meyer’s article “Energy from Matter” in <em>Discovery</em> magazine highlighted the potential of atomic power while acknowledging its limitations and dangers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>World War II and the Atomic Bomb:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Research on atomic energy shifted to military applications during World War II.</li>
<li>Public discussion of atomic energy ceased, replaced by a veil of secrecy.</li>
<li>The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 introduced the public to the destructive power of nuclear energy.</li>
<li>The subsequent publication of “Atomic Energy for Military Purposes” by Henry DeWolf Smith reignited public interest in the potential of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Post-War Optimism and the Nuclear Paradox:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The post-war era saw widespread optimism about the potential of nuclear power to provide clean, abundant, and inexpensive energy.</li>
<li>Louis L. Strauss, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), famously predicted “electrical energy too cheap to meter.”</li>
<li>However, this optimism was tempered by the inherent dangers associated with nuclear technology, exemplified by the destructive power of the atomic bomb.</li>
<li><strong>The nuclear paradox:</strong> The promise of a clean and abundant energy source juxtaposed with the potential for catastrophic destruction and long-term health risks.</li>

<section id="the-challenges-of-nuclear-power-development" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-challenges-of-nuclear-power-development">The Challenges of Nuclear Power Development</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Perception and Fear:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The association of nuclear power with nuclear weapons created a significant public relations challenge.</li>
<li>The development of increasingly powerful nuclear weapons, along with Cold War anxieties, fueled public fear and skepticism.</li>
<li>Government efforts to educate the public about the safety of nuclear power were often met with distrust.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The AEC’s Conflicting Roles:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The AEC was tasked with promoting civilian nuclear power while simultaneously managing the nuclear arsenal and downplaying potential risks.</li>
<li>This led to a lack of transparency and eroded public trust.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Economic Realities:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The high upfront capital costs of building nuclear power plants proved to be a major obstacle to expansion.</li>
<li>Nuclear power was ultimately more expensive than traditional fossil fuels, despite lower fuel costs.</li>
<li><strong>Economic factors, not public fear, were the primary reason for the halt in nuclear power expansion in the 1970s.</strong></li>
</ul></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-decline-of-nuclear-power-in-the-united-states">The Decline of Nuclear Power in the United States</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Three Mile Island Accident (1979):</strong>
<ul>
<li>A partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island Unit 2 reactor in Pennsylvania further damaged public confidence in nuclear power.</li>
<li>While not a catastrophic event, it highlighted the potential for accidents and the challenges of managing nuclear technology.</li>
<li><strong>The accident was a symptom of the decline, not the cause.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Chernobyl Disaster (1986):</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union, a catastrophic nuclear accident, solidified public anxieties about nuclear power safety.</li>
<li>The accident had a limited impact on the US nuclear industry, which was already in decline.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Nuclear Power in a Coma:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Following the economic challenges and public backlash, nuclear power expansion in the United States stalled.</li>
<li>New plant construction ceased, research and development slowed, and the nuclear industry entered a period of stagnation.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>In France, <strong>uranium tetrafluoride (yellow cake)</strong> is processed and enriched for use in nuclear power plants.</li>
<li><strong>Eurodif</strong>, a subsidiary of Kojima, operates a large <strong>gaseous diffusion plant</strong> to enrich uranium.</li>
<li>The plant enriches uranium from 0.7202% <strong>U-235</strong> (the fissile isotope) to 20.0% U-235.</li>
<li>In May 1972, an alarm was triggered at the Pierre-Lotte facility due to a <strong>U-235 deficit</strong> in a batch of uranium hexafluoride.</li>
<li>The U-235 concentration was only 0.7171%, significantly lower than the expected 0.7202%.</li>
<li>An investigation by the <strong>Commissariat à l’énergie atomique (CEA)</strong> traced the deficit back to the <strong>Oklo mine in Gabon, Africa</strong>.</li>
<li>Some Oklo samples showed U-235 deficits as high as 0.44%.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Francis Perrin</strong>, a French physicist, was tasked with investigating the missing U-235.</li>
<li><strong>All uranium on Earth is the same age</strong> and originates from the supernova explosion of a star billions of years ago.</li>
<li>Uranium is <strong>unstable</strong> and decays into thorium and eventually lead over millions of years.</li>
<li><strong>U-235 decays faster than U-238</strong>, leading to a gradual decrease in the concentration of U-235 over time.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>16 natural nuclear reactors</strong> were discovered at three locations within the Oklo mines.</li>
<li>The CEA announced the discovery of self-sustaining nuclear chain reactions at Oklo on <strong>September 25, 1972</strong>.</li>
<li>The reactors operated about <strong>1.5 billion years ago</strong>.</li>
<li>At that time, the natural uranium at Oklo had a U-235 concentration of <strong>3%</strong>, similar to the enriched uranium used in some modern reactors.</li>
<li><strong>Groundwater</strong> leaking into the uranium deposit acted as a <strong>moderator</strong>, slowing down neutrons and initiating the chain reaction.</li>
<li>The reactors operated in <strong>pulse mode</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Water heated up and boiled away, shutting down the reaction.</li>
<li>The reactors cooled down, allowing water to seep back in and restart the cycle.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The operating interval was approximately <strong>two hours and thirty minutes</strong>.</li>
<li>The reactors operated for a few hundred thousand years.</li>
<li>They produced heat at a rate of <strong>100 kilowatts</strong>, generated <strong>11,907 pounds of radioactive waste</strong>, and <strong>3,307 pounds of plutonium</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Examples: Mud (earth and water), bricks (heated mud, water driven off), steam (water and air heated by fire).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Atomic Theory in India (550 BCE):</strong> Nyaya and Vaisheshika schools described elementary particles combining in pairs and trios to form complex materials.</li>
<li><strong>Greek Atomic Theory (430 BCE):</strong> Leucippus and Democritus proposed that matter is made of indivisible particles called <strong>atoms</strong> (“uncuttable”).
<ul>
<li>These theories lacked experimental evidence and were considered philosophical.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Practical Chemistry:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ancient industries (soap making, tool production) required empirical knowledge of chemical combinations and metal alloys.</li>
<li>Limitations of the four-element theory became evident due to the lack of a systematic method of analysis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Alchemy (Spagyric Art):</strong>
<ul>
<li>A 2,500-year-old practice focused on transmuting base metals into gold.</li>
<li><strong>Three Elements:</strong> Alchemists believed in three elements: salt, sulfur, and mercury.</li>
<li><strong>Contributions:</strong> Advanced distillation techniques, discovery of acids and bases.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sir Joseph John J.J. Thompson (born 1856)</strong> was a British physicist at the Cavendish Laboratory in England.</li>
<li>Thompson’s parents encouraged him to pursue engineering.
<ul>
<li>He enrolled in an apprenticeship but, due to a waiting list, <strong>joined Owens College in Manchester at age 14</strong>.</li>
<li>He later <strong>transferred to Trinity College in Cambridge</strong>, graduating with a B.A. in mathematics in 1880 and an M.A.&nbsp;in mathematical physics in 1883.</li>
<li>He became <strong>Cavendish Professor of Physics in 1884</strong> and married Rose Paget in 1890.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Thompson focused on investigating cathode rays</strong>, a popular area of research involving vacuum tubes and high-voltage coils.
<ul>
<li><strong>Cathode rays were streams of energy observed in vacuum tubes when high voltage was applied across electrodes.</strong></li>
<li>Wilhelm Röntgen had used cathode rays to produce X-rays, but their nature remained a mystery.</li>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thompsons-cathode-ray-experiments">Thompson’s Cathode Ray Experiments</h5>
<ul>
<li>Thompson conducted <strong>three sequential experiments to determine the nature of cathode rays.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experiment 1:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To determine if the negative charge associated with cathode rays could be separated from the rays themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Setup:</strong> A specialized vacuum tube with a cathode, anode with a slit, and a third electrode at the end.</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> High voltage was applied, and an electrometer measured current between the first and third electrodes. A magnet was then used to deflect the beam.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong>
<ul>
<li>An electrical current flowed, indicating a component of electricity in the rays.</li>
<li>The magnet deflected the beam, causing the current to stop.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The <strong>negative charge and the rays were inseparable</strong>, indicating they were a single entity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Experiment 2:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To further confirm that cathode rays were streams of electrical charge.</li>
<li><strong>Setup:</strong> A vacuum tube with a hole in the anode to create a thin beam, phosphorescent paint at the end, and two parallel metal plates in the flight path.</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> High voltage was applied across the deflection plates.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> The beam bent towards the positive plate.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The deflection confirmed that the <strong>rays were indeed streams of electrical charge.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Experiment 3:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To confirm the nature of cathode rays using magnetic deflection.</li>
<li><strong>Setup:</strong> Similar to Experiment 2, but with external magnetic coils instead of deflection plates.</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> A controlled magnetic field was applied across the tube.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> The beam deflected predictably in the magnetic field.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The results from both electrostatic and magnetic deflection solidified Thompson’s understanding.</li>

<li><strong>Thompson concluded that cathode rays are composed of tiny, negatively charged particles he called “corpuscles”.</strong>
<ul>
<li>These particles were later named <strong>electrons</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Based on the deflection angles, he calculated the <strong>charge-to-mass ratio</strong> of the corpuscles.
<ul>
<li>He determined that the <strong>mass was negligible</strong>, and the <strong>charge was negative</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Thompson proposed the “plum-pudding model” of the atom.</strong>
<ul>
<li>This model depicted the atom as a <strong>large, positively charged sphere with embedded negative corpuscles (electrons).</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Thompson’s discoveries revolutionized physics.</strong>
<ul>
<li>He demonstrated that atoms, previously thought indestructible, could be disassembled.</li>
<li>He won the <strong>Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Through extensive chemical processing of pitchblende, they isolated two new radioactive elements:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Polonium</strong>, named after Marie’s native Poland.</li>
<li><strong>Radium</strong>, named after the term “radiation.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>They discovered these elements were products of the uranium decay chain.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Uranium and thorium, being the heaviest naturally occurring elements, are unstable and decay into lighter, radioactive elements, eventually ending with non-radioactive lead.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Curies refined a small quantity of pure radium metal.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Radium is intensely radioactive and emits a blue glow</strong> due to its interaction with air.</li>

<li>He excelled academically and earned scholarships to Nelson College and the University of New Zealand.</li>
<li>He earned an M.A.&nbsp;in mathematics and physical science at age 22.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rutherford and his colleague Frederick Soddy investigated a gas emanating from thorium.</strong>
<ul>
<li>They found the <strong>gas was chemically inert</strong>, leading them to believe <strong>thorium was transmuting into argon</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>They studied the radioactivity of various elements using a method of counting flashes on a phosphorescent screen caused by radiation.</li>
<li><strong>They discovered that:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Different elements had different radiation rates.</li>
<li>An element’s radiation rate decreased exponentially over time, a concept Soddy termed <strong>“half-life.”</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>They concluded that the gas was a result of thorium atom decay.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Radioactive decay involves an atom emitting radiation and transforming into a lighter element.</li>
<li>The decay product can also be radioactive.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>They found that elements could have chemically identical subtypes with different half-lives, which Soddy termed “isotopes.”</strong>

<li><strong>In 1903, Rutherford and Soddy published “Radioactive Change,” presenting the first experimental measurements of energy produced by atomic decay.</strong>
<ul>
<li>They found that one gram of radium released an enormous amount of energy (estimated between 100 million and 10 billion calories).</li>
<li>This highlighted the <strong>vast difference in energy levels between chemical r</strong>eactions (electron binding) and the forces holding the atomic nucleus together.****</li>

<ul>
<li>Rutherford, intrigued by Lenard’s claim of atomic vacuum, conducted experiments with alpha particles.</li>
<li><strong>He used a magnetic field to deflect alpha particles and observed their scattering through a thin piece of mica.</strong>
<ul>
<li>The mica deflected alpha particles more than the strongest magnet.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rutherford moved to the University of Manchester in 1907.</li>
<li>In 1908, he proved that alpha particles were helium atoms stripped of their electrons.</li>
<li><strong>In 1910, Rutherford, Hans Geiger, and Ernest Marsden conducted the Gold Foil Experiment.</strong>
<ul>
<li>They aimed a beam of alpha particles at a thin gold foil and observed their scattering using a zinc sulfide screen and microscope.</li>
<li>They unexpectedly found that some alpha particles were deflected at very large angles, even bouncing backwards.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rutherford interpreted this as evidence for a dense, positively charged nucleus at the center of the atom.</strong>
<ul>
<li>He realized that most of the atom’s mass and positive charge were concentrated in a tiny nucleus.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rutherford’s model replaced the plum-pudding model.</strong>

<li><strong>Niels Bohr</strong>, a brilliant physicist, recognized the connection between Einstein’s light quanta and atomic structure.</li>
<li>Bohr worked with <strong>Rutherford</strong>, whose <strong>solar system model of the atom</strong> had limitations:
<ul>
<li>Electrons orbiting the nucleus should repel each other.</li>
<li>An orbiting electron, constantly accelerating, should emit radiation and eventually collapse into the nucleus, contradicting the stability of atoms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bohr was inspired by <strong>spectral lines</strong>, the unique patterns of light emitted by excited gases.
<ul>
<li><strong>Balmer’s formula</strong> (1885) could predict the wavelengths of hydrogen’s spectral lines using integer values.</li>
<li><strong>Rydberg’s formula</strong> (1890) generalized Balmer’s formula for other elements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bohr realized that the <strong>integers in these formulas implied quantization of the emitted light</strong>.</li>
<li>He proposed that electrons exist in <strong>discrete energy states</strong>, not continuous orbits.</li>
<li><strong>Electrons jump (quantum leap) between these energy states</strong>, emitting or absorbing specific amounts of energy corresponding to the spectral lines.</li>
<li>Bohr’s model successfully <strong>derived the Rydberg constant</strong> using fundamental constants (electron mass, electron charge, Planck’s constant).</li>
<li>It validated Einstein’s light quanta theory, Planck’s equation, and provided a physical basis for Balmer and Rydberg’s formulas.</li>

<li>Heisenberg proposed that at the atomic level, there are <strong>fundamental limits to the precision of measurement</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The act of measuring a quantity inevitably disturbs the system</strong>, leading to a loss of information about other quantities.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Measuring the <strong>position</strong> of an electron precisely (e.g., with a flash photograph) makes its <strong>speed</strong> unknowable.</li>
<li>Measuring the <strong>speed</strong> of an electron precisely (e.g., by scattering gamma rays) makes its <strong>position</strong> unknowable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Since an electron’s energy (and thus speed) can be precisely measured using spectroscopy, its position becomes uncertain.</li>

<li><strong>1920s:</strong> The structure of the <strong>atomic nucleus</strong> remained an enigma, as experimental physics entered a period of contemplation.</li>
<li><strong>Lord Ernest Rutherford’s Bakarian lecture (June 3rd, 1920):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Topic: <strong>Transmutation of nitrogen atoms</strong> using <strong>alpha particles</strong>.</li>
<li>Rutherford deviated from the main topic, raising a critical question about atomic weight discrepancies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Atomic Weight Problem:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Established understanding:</strong> Atoms consist of <strong>electrons</strong> (negative charge) orbiting a <strong>nucleus</strong> composed of <strong>protons</strong> (positive charge). The number of protons and electrons is equal, resulting in a neutral atom.</li>
<li><strong>Discrepancy:</strong> Atomic weights of elements heavier than hydrogen did not align with the number of protons.
<ul>
<li>Example: Helium has two protons but weighs four times as much as hydrogen (which has one proton).</li>
<li>Further examples:
<ul>
<li>Nitrogen: 7 protons, atomic weight of 17.</li>
<li>Barium: 58 protons, atomic weight of 137.</li>
<li>Uranium: 92 protons, atomic weight of 238.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li>Obtained a Master of Science in Physics from the University of Cambridge.</li>
<li>Worked with Hans Geiger in Germany on the <strong>Geiger counter</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>World War I:</strong> Interned at Ruhleben POW camp in Germany.
<ul>
<li>Continued scientific pursuits even in captivity, investigating the ionization of phosphorus and the photochemical reaction of carbon monoxide and chlorine.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Returned to England after the war and rejoined Rutherford’s team.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Chadwick’s Experiments:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tasked with finding the neutron.</li>
<li>Began by bombarding various materials with <strong>alpha particles</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Alpha particles:</strong> Helium nuclei, heavy and capable of causing nuclear disintegration.</li>
<li><strong>Beryllium anomaly:</strong>
<ul>
<li>When bombarded with alpha particles, beryllium emitted an unusually high intensity of <strong>gamma rays</strong> but no proton debris.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Role of Polonium-210:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Chadwick needed a strong <strong>polonium-210 alpha source</strong> (which emits alphas without gamma contamination) for his experiments.</li>
<li><strong>Irene Joliot-Curie</strong> and <strong>Frederic Joliot-Curie</strong> possessed the largest polonium-210 source at the time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Joliot-Curies’ Experiments (1931):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Used their alpha source and an <strong>ionization chamber</strong> to study beryllium’s response to alpha bombardment.</li>
<li><strong>Ionization chamber:</strong> A metal can filled with air and a central wire; ionizing events create a conductive trail, allowing for the detection and measurement of radiation.</li>
<li><strong>Cellophane experiment:</strong> Observed that gamma rays from beryllium, after passing through cellophane, caused a surge of protons in the detector.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Attributed the proton emission to the gamma rays knocking protons out of the hydrogen in the cellophane.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Chadwick’s Reinterpretation:</strong>
<ul>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="leo-szilard-and-the-concept-of-nuclear-chain-reaction">Leo Szilard and the Concept of Nuclear Chain Reaction</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leo Szilard (1898-1964):</strong>
<ul>
<li>A genius with a passion for physics and politics.</li>
<li>Born in Budapest, Hungary.</li>
<li>Studied engineering and later physics in Budapest and Berlin.</li>
<li>Received his doctorate from the Humboldt University in Berlin in 1923.</li>
<li>Fled to England in 1933 due to rising anti-Semitism in Germany.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Szilard’s Epiphany (September 12, 1933):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Read about Rutherford’s skepticism regarding nuclear power in <em>The Times</em>.</li>
<li>While crossing the street, Szilard conceived the idea of a <strong>nuclear chain reaction</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Chain Reaction Concept:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Neutron’s role:</strong> Neutrons, being uncharged, can penetrate nuclei easily.</li>
<li><strong>Nuclear instability:</strong> A neutron absorbed by a heavy, neutron-rich nucleus can induce instability.</li>
<li><strong>Nuclear fission:</strong> The unstable nucleus can split, releasing energy and more neutrons.</li>
<li><strong>Self-sustaining reaction:</strong> The released neutrons can trigger further fissions, creating a chain reaction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Szilard’s Patent and Research:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Applied for a patent for a nuclear reactor in 1934 (assigned to the British Admiralty).</li>
<li>Immigrated to the United States in 1938.</li>
<li>Continued research, initially focusing on beryllium and indium, but without success.</li>
<li>Became disillusioned and wrote to the Admiralty to withdraw his patent application.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="otto-hahn-lise-meitner-and-the-discovery-of-nuclear-fission">Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and the Discovery of Nuclear Fission</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Otto Hahn (1879-1968):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Born in Frankfurt, Germany.</li>
<li>Studied chemistry and became a pioneer in <strong>radiochemistry</strong>.</li>
<li>Headed the radioactivity department of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Chemistry in Berlin.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lise Meitner (1878-1968):</strong>
<ul>
<li>A physicist from Vienna, Austria.</li>
<li>Collaborated with Hahn for 30 years.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Neutron Bombardment Experiments:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hahn and Meitner systematically bombarded elements with neutrons, culminating with uranium.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Meitner’s Escape:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Meitner, being Jewish, had to flee Germany in 1938 due to the escalating Nazi threat.</li>
<li>Continued communication with Hahn through letters.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Uranium Puzzle:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hahn’s analysis of neutron-bombarded uranium yielded a puzzling radioactive isotope.</li>
<li>Initially suspected it to be radium, using barium as a carrier in fractional crystallization.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Breakthrough:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Meitner realized that the product was not radium but barium itself.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Nuclear Fission:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hahn had split the uranium atom, producing barium (slightly more than half the mass of uranium) and krypton (undetectable chemically).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hahn’s Publications:</strong>
<ul>
<li>First paper (December 22, 1938): Cautiously reported the production of alkaline earth metals from uranium bombarded with neutrons.</li>
<li>Second paper: Reported the liberation of two free neutrons during fission.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact of the Discovery:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Generated immense excitement in the physics community, particularly for Szilard.</li>
<li>Szilard urged the British Admiralty to reinstate his patent application.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>From Fantasy to Puzzle:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nuclear power transitioned from a theoretical concept to a tangible possibility.</li>
<li>Experimentalists had validated Einstein’s prediction of mass-energy conversion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Remaining Question:</strong> The specific mechanism of how uranium converts mass into energy remained to be elucidated.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Similar Situation:</strong> A comparable scenario unfolded in the United States in 1939.
<ul>
<li>President Roosevelt observed Europe and Asia preparing for another world war.</li>
<li>Refugee nuclear scientists from Europe arrived with warnings about Germany’s plans.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hitler’s Ambitions and the “Ultimate Weapon”:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adolf Hitler aimed to dominate Europe.</li>
<li>German scientists were reportedly developing a weapon capable of destroying an entire city – a <strong>uranium-based weapon</strong> utilizing the newly discovered <strong>fission process</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Refugee Advice and the Threat to the US:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Refugees from various countries had historically advised the US on invasions.</li>
<li>These European refugees presented a technical reason for intervention – the potential for Germany to use an ultimate weapon in the Western hemisphere.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Scientists’ Warnings:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Scientists like <strong>Leo Szilard</strong> issued dire warnings about the potential consequences of a German atomic bomb.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Germany’s Nuclear Program:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Information about Germany’s nuclear work ceased, creating suspicion.</li>
<li>Germany stopped the sale of uranium from Czechoslovakia.</li>
<li>This led to the assumption that Germany was building a bomb.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The US Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The resulting <strong>nuclear panic</strong> drove a crash program in the US to develop nuclear technology, prioritizing it over military action in the Pacific or Europe.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>World War II and the Priority Shift:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941</strong>, by Japan, formally brought the US into World War II.</li>
<li>Despite Japan’s attack, the US government prioritized defeating Germany.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="leo-szilard-and-the-push-for-us-nuclear-research">Leo Szilard and the Push for US Nuclear Research</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Szilard’s Persuasive Abilities:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leo Szilard</strong> possessed exceptional persuasive skills, able to quickly assess individuals and convince them to act as he desired.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Szilard’s Early Research:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In 1939, Szilard established a lab at Columbia University and began experimenting with <strong>nuclear fission</strong> for power production.</li>
<li>He obtained uranium oxide from the <strong>Eldorado Radium Corporation</strong> and persuaded the <strong>National Carbon Company</strong> to produce high-purity graphite bricks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Need for Government Support:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Szilard realized that a large-scale effort, requiring government resources, was necessary to achieve <strong>self-sustained fission</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fermi’s Meeting with the Navy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Szilard arranged for <strong>Enrico Fermi</strong> to meet with the Navy Department on March 17, 1939, to discuss nuclear power.</li>
<li>The meeting, attended by naval officers and scientists, was unproductive.</li>
<li>Fermi’s lecture was not well-received, and he was unable to provide specifics about potential applications.</li>
<li>The meeting ended with no commitments from the Navy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Einstein-Szilard Letter:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Szilard, along with <strong>Eugene Wigner</strong> and <strong>Edward Teller</strong>, decided to write a letter to <strong>Queen Elizabeth of Belgium</strong> to prevent Germany from acquiring uranium from the Belgian Congo.</li>
<li>They sought <strong>Albert Einstein’s</strong> help due to his connection with the Queen.</li>
<li>On July 16, 1939, Szilard and Wigner met with Einstein, who agreed to write a letter to the Belgian ambassador, with a copy to the State Department.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Alexander Sachs and a Letter to Roosevelt:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alexander Sachs</strong>, an economist and friend of President Roosevelt, learned of Szilard’s plans and suggested writing directly to the President.</li>
<li>Szilard drafted a new letter, and on July 30, 1939, he, Einstein, and Teller finalized it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Letter’s Content:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The letter highlighted the potential of uranium as a new energy source and the possibility of creating a powerful bomb.</li>
<li>It warned of Germany’s potential development of such a weapon and urged the US to appoint an administrator and initiate its own research.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sachs’ Meeting with Roosevelt:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sachs delivered the letter to Roosevelt on October 11, 1939.</li>
<li>Instead of reading the letter, Sachs summarized its key points.</li>
<li>Roosevelt recognized the threat and initiated action.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Uranium Committee:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Uranium Committee</strong> was formed and held its first meeting on October 21, 1939.</li>
<li><strong>Dr.&nbsp;Lyman L. Briggs</strong> headed the committee, with representatives from the Army and Navy present.</li>
<li>Szilard and Wigner presented their case, but the Army representatives were skeptical.</li>
<li>Teller requested $6,000 for initial research, which was granted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>British Developments:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In February 1940, the British government received a report about potential German nuclear weapons research.</li>
<li>The <strong>Maud Committee</strong> was formed to evaluate the feasibility of nuclear power and weapons.</li>
<li>By December 1940, the Maud Committee concluded that a uranium bomb was feasible and could change the course of the war.</li>
<li>Recognizing their limited resources, they recommended collaboration with the US.</li>
<li>A report was sent to Briggs, but he locked it in his safe and forgot about it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>NDRC and Project S-1:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vannevar Bush</strong> formed the <strong>National Defense Research Committee (NDRC)</strong> in June 1940.</li>
<li>By July 1941, the NDRC absorbed the Uranium Committee, and the sustained fission initiative became <strong>Project S-1</strong>.</li>
<li>Bush appointed <strong>Arthur Compton</strong> as the director of S-1.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pearl Harbor and the Escalation of the Project:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, officially brought the US into World War II.</li>
<li>Four days later, Germany declared war on the US.</li>
<li>These events led to the acceleration of the atomic bomb project.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Parallel Threat:</strong> Another line of nuclear physics research was developing at the University of California, Berkeley.</li>
<li><strong>Quantum Mechanics and Nuclear Structure:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quantum mechanics</strong> provided a solid model of atomic structure.</li>
<li>Scientists applied quantum principles to understand the nucleus, composed of <strong>protons</strong> and <strong>neutrons</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Element 94:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Quantum mechanics predicted the existence of <strong>Element 94</strong>, a hypothetical element beyond uranium, which could be fissile.</li>
<li>The fissile isotope would be <strong>isotope 239</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Transmutation and Neutron Capture:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transmutation</strong> of elements was possible through nuclear decay and neutron capture.</li>
<li>Uranium could potentially be transmuted into Element 94 through neutron absorption.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ernest O. Lawrence and the Cyclotron:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ernest O. Lawrence</strong> invented the <strong>cyclotron</strong>, a device that could accelerate particles to high speeds.</li>
<li>Lawrence built increasingly larger cyclotrons at Berkeley.</li>
<li>The cyclotron could produce neutrons by bombarding beryllium with deuterons.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Glenn Seaborg and the Synthesis of Element 94:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Glenn Seaborg</strong> used Lawrence’s cyclotron to synthesize <strong>iodine-121</strong> and <strong>iron-59</strong>.</li>
<li>In August 1940, Seaborg attempted to synthesize Element 94.</li>
<li>On February 23, 1941, they isolated a unique alpha emitter, believed to be Element 94.</li>
<li>On February 26, 1941, they confirmed the synthesis of Element 94, which they named <strong>Plutonium (Pu)</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Challenge of Plutonium Production:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Producing gram quantities of plutonium using the cyclotron would take an impractically long time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Need for a Nuclear Reactor:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>nuclear reactor</strong> was needed to produce a massive source of neutrons for converting U-238 into Pu-239.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Enrico Fermi and the First Nuclear Reactor:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enrico Fermi</strong> and his team at the University of Chicago built the first nuclear reactor in late 1942.</li>
<li>This reactor provided a neutron source for plutonium production and proved that nuclear reactions could be harnessed for power.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Flawless Experiment:</strong> Fermi’s demonstration of controlled, sustained chain-reacting fission was a remarkably flawless experiment.</li>
<li><strong>The OSRD and Project S-1:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The NDRC evolved into the <strong>Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD)</strong>.</li>
<li>Arthur Compton continued to lead Project S-1.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fermi’s Team and the Move to Chicago:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fermi’s team conducted experiments at Columbia University before moving to Chicago for greater secrecy and space.</li>
<li>They chose an abandoned squash court under the West Stands of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Construction of CP-1:</strong>
<ul>
<li>On November 16, 1942, Fermi’s team began constructing the <strong>“pile”</strong>, later known as <strong>Chicago Pile 1 (CP-1)</strong>.</li>
<li>CP-1 was a roughly spherical structure made of graphite bricks and uranium cylinders, with <strong>cadmium control rods</strong> to regulate the reaction.</li>
<li><strong>Neutron detectors</strong> and recording equipment were installed on a balcony overlooking the court.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Experiment:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The experiment to achieve a self-sustaining reaction was scheduled for December 2, 1942.</li>
<li><strong>George Weil</strong> controlled a major control rod, while others stood by with cadmium salt solution and a fire axe as emergency measures.</li>
<li><strong>Norm Hilberry</strong> was prepared to cut a rope holding a <strong>“zip rod”</strong> for emergency shutdown.</li>
<li>Fermi, Compton, <strong>Herb Anderson</strong>, and <strong>Walter Zinn</strong> operated the control panel.</li>
<li><strong>Leona Woods</strong> was the only woman present and recorded the experiment in her notebook.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Sequence of Events:</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li>At 9:45 a.m., the experiment began with the withdrawal of electrically driven control rods.</li>
<li>At 10:00 a.m., Zinn pulled out the gravity rod.</li>
<li>Fermi directed the withdrawal of the <strong>vernier control rod</strong> in stages, observing the neutron count rate.</li>
<li>At 11:35 a.m., the automatically actuated safety rod was accidentally triggered, shutting down the reaction prematurely.</li>
<li>Fermi called for a lunch break.</li>
<li>At 2:00 p.m., the experiment resumed.</li>
<li>At 3:20 p.m., Fermi called for further withdrawal of the vernier control rod.</li>
<li>At 3:52 p.m., Fermi announced that the <strong>reaction was self-sustaining</strong>, proving the feasibility of nuclear power.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Compton’s Phone Call:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Compton informed <strong>James B. Conant</strong>, head of the S-1 funding committee, about the success using a coded message: “The Italian navigator has landed in the New World.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Aftermath:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The pile was shut down, having produced power at a rate of half a watt.</li>
<li>The experiment marked a major milestone in nuclear physics and paved the way for the development of nuclear weapons and power plants.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>World War II</strong> transformed nuclear physics from an open field to a military secret.</li>
<li>Journal publications ceased, and research moved from universities to <strong>secret laboratories</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Strict security measures</strong> were implemented:
<ul>
<li>Personnel were relocated and sworn to secrecy.</li>
<li>Construction workers and laborers were unaware of the projects’ true nature.</li>
<li><strong>Code words</strong> replaced key terms (e.g., Uranium-235 became “ore alloy”).</li>
<li>Facilities were heavily guarded with barbed wire, watchtowers, and minefields.</li>
<li>Mail censorship, photography bans, and controlled documents were enforced.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Examples of secrecy:
<ul>
<li>Robert Spruill, president of the University of California and administrator of a nuclear lab, was uninformed about the lab’s purpose.</li>
<li>Laura Fermi, Enrico Fermi’s wife, remained unaware of her husband’s work until after the war.</li>
<li>Counter-stories explained unusual events to the public.</li>
<li>Foreign scientists were monitored by the FBI.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite the scale of the project, <strong>security was remarkably effective</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Germany and Japan remained unaware of the project.</li>
<li>Even Vice President Harry S. Truman was kept in the dark until FDR’s death.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Nuclear technology advanced rapidly</strong> in this secretive environment, transitioning from a theoretical topic to an industrial process in just three years.</li>

<li><strong>Harold Urey</strong> championed the <strong>gaseous diffusion</strong> method.</li>
<li>The process exploited the slightly faster diffusion rate of lighter gas molecules through a permeable membrane.</li>
<li>The effect was small, requiring thousands of repetitions.</li>
<li><strong>Practical challenges</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Uranium had to be converted into gaseous <strong>uranium hexafluoride</strong>.</li>
<li>Uranium hexafluoride is highly reactive, requiring <strong>nickel</strong> for all components (pipes, valves, etc.).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>K-25</strong> was a massive building, half a mile long and 1,000 feet wide, the largest in the world at the time.</li>
<li>15,000 people were involved in its construction and operation.</li>
<li><strong>K-25 did not reach full capacity during the war</strong> due to the time-consuming nature of diffusion.</li>
<li>However, it proved to be a more efficient and less wasteful process than calutrons.</li>
<li>The U.S. emerged from the war with the <strong>only uranium enrichment plant in the world</strong>, influencing future nuclear power development.</li>

<li><strong>B Reactor</strong>, the first production reactor, was housed in a gymnasium-sized building.
<ul>
<li>It used graphite bricks as a moderator and natural uranium slugs as fuel.</li>
<li>Water from the Columbia River was used for cooling.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company</strong> engineered and operated the complex.</li>
<li><strong>B Reactor achieved criticality on September 26, 1944</strong>, with Enrico Fermi present.</li>
<li>However, <strong>the reactor shut down unexpectedly after an hour of high-power operation</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>John A. Wheeler</strong> identified the cause as <strong>xenon poisoning</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Xenon-135</strong>, a fission product, is a powerful neutron absorber.</li>
<li>At high power, xenon-135 buildup absorbs enough neutrons to stop the chain reaction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wheeler had anticipated a potential problem and insisted on extra fuel channels in the design, which proved crucial in overcoming xenon poisoning.</li>
<li>Subsequent reactors (D and F) were built with the enhanced design, and B Reactor was modified.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Thomas Farrell</strong> was correct in stating that on July 16, 1945, the war was over in theory, as Japan had not yet surrendered.</li>
<li>Farrell and <strong>Deke Parsons</strong> flew to <strong>Tinian Island</strong> to begin preparations for the atomic bombing of Japan.
<ul>
<li>This effort was codenamed <strong>Project Alberta</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Technical glitches still needed to be resolved.
<ul>
<li>For maximum effectiveness, an atomic bomb needed to be detonated 2,000 feet above the ground.</li>
<li>The trigger signal for both bombs would be provided by <strong>ARCHIs</strong> (redundant RT-34-APS-13 tail-warning radars).
<ul>
<li>ARCHIs were used in fighter planes to warn pilots of approaching aircraft from behind.</li>
<li>Built by RCA, one ARCHI cost as much as a new Cadillac limousine.</li>
<li>Four ARCHIs would be used in each bomb, each providing an opinion of the bomb’s height above ground.</li>
<li>If any two Archies agreed that the bomb had passed 2,000 feet, the firing circuit would be closed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To prevent confusion from Japanese air search radar, the Archies would be turned off until the bomb had fallen to 17,000 feet.
<ul>
<li>The turn-on altitude would be determined by six voting aneroid barometric switches.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The bomb run altitude of the plane would be 31,000 feet.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pumpkin runs</strong> (tests over the ocean using dummy bombs) revealed problems with the barometers due to shock waves around the bomb case.
<ul>
<li>These problems would be addressed.</li>

<li>In July 1945, Tinian was the busiest airbase in the world.
<ul>
<li>It had six 8,500-foot runways and 40,000 personnel.</li>
<li>B-29s were constantly taking off and landing, conducting incendiary bombing raids on Japan.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Over half a million people had been killed in the firebombing campaign, and Tokyo was essentially destroyed.
<ul>
<li>Dropping an atomic bomb on Tokyo would not provide any meaningful data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Planners had intentionally left some large cities untouched to assess the effects of an atomic bomb on an undamaged city.
<ul>
<li><strong>Kyoto</strong> was initially the top target but was removed from the list at the insistence of Secretary of War <strong>Henry Stimson</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Hiroshima</strong>, a port city near the southern end of Honshu, became the primary target.
<ul>
<li>Hiroshima was home to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Hiroshima shipyards, Second Army Headquarters, and the Hiroshima Ordnance Supply Depot, making it an ideal target.</li>

<li>At 10:53 a.m., two B-29s, <strong>Boxcar</strong> and <strong>The Great Artiste</strong>, were sighted but were mistaken for weather planes.</li>
<li>Captain <strong>Kermit Beahan</strong>, the bombardier on Boxcar, faced multiple problems.
<ul>
<li>They initially attempted to bomb the primary target, Kokura, but it was obscured by clouds.</li>
<li>A fuel transfer pump malfunction limited their fuel reserves.</li>
<li>They diverted to the secondary target, Nagasaki, but had difficulty seeing the ground.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite a prohibition against using radar for bomb aiming, Beahan resorted to it to avoid ditching the bomb in the ocean.</li>
<li>At 11:00 a.m. Nagasaki time, radar operator <strong>James F. Van Pelt Jr.</strong> identified the high school soccer field in the <strong>Urakami Valley</strong> on the radar scope.</li>

<li>He advocated for nuclear submarine propulsion, despite the Navy’s apparent lack of interest.</li>
<li>The Navy had actually started a secret uranium enrichment project in the Philadelphia Navy Yard, which was later absorbed into the Manhattan Project.</li>
<li>The Navy formally proposed nuclear propulsion in December 1944 (<strong>Project D</strong>), with a detailed appendix by <strong>Dr.&nbsp;Phil Abelson</strong>.</li>
<li>Rickover developed key design principles:
<ol type="1">
<li>Reactor design was primarily an engineering problem (95%), not a physics problem (5%).</li>
<li>Design should start with the propeller shaft and work backward to the reactor.</li>
<li>Assume future uranium abundance and do not constrain the design by fuel availability.</li>
<li>The reactor must fit within the diameter of an ideal submarine hull.</li>

<li><strong>Reason for relay logic:</strong> Proven reliability and extensive use since before 1946.</li>
<li><strong>Silicon chip limitations:</strong> Relatively new technology with less established reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Paradox:</strong> The age of the relay technology made it the preferred choice for the new power reactor.</li>
<li><strong>Conservative approach:</strong> Innovative power production concepts relied on well-established component technologies.</li>

<ul>
<li>British scientists contributed expertise at Los Alamos but were excluded from production facilities like the Hanford plutonium reactors.</li>

<li><strong>Winston Churchill</strong> convinced <strong>Franklin Roosevelt</strong> of the need for a formal agreement to share atomic bomb expertise and data.</li>
<li>The <strong>Quebec Agreement</strong>, signed on <strong>August 19, 1943</strong>, formalized this collaboration, including <strong>Canada</strong> in the information-sharing policy due to their contribution of nuclear physicists.</li>
<li>An extended agreement signed at <strong>Hyde Park</strong> on <strong>September 18, 1944</strong>, pledged full cooperation in post-war nuclear pursuits, both military and civilian.</li>
<li>Following Roosevelt’s death and <strong>Harry S. Truman</strong>’s presidency, the modified agreement was seemingly lost, and Truman showed no interest in sharing atomic bomb information.</li>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>Atomic Energy Act (McMahon Act)</strong>, passed by the US Congress in <strong>August 1946</strong>, prohibited sharing atomic energy secrets with any foreign country, including Britain and Canada, under penalty of death.</li>
<li>The <strong>Soviet Union</strong>, despite being a wartime ally, was intentionally excluded from atomic bomb development information.</li>
<li>Soviet leaders recognized the importance of nuclear technology and initiated their own program, facing challenges such as the German invasion and a lack of resources.</li>
<li>They compensated for these limitations through a highly effective <strong>espionage operation</strong>, stealing crucial information that accelerated their nuclear development.</li>
<li><strong>Soviet spies</strong> within the Manhattan Project included:
<ul>
<li><strong>Klaus Fuchs</strong> (physicist, codenamed Charles)</li>
<li><strong>Ted Hall</strong> (physicist, codenamed Imlad)</li>
<li><strong>David Greenglass</strong> (machinist, codenamed Caliber)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Using this intelligence, Soviet scientists, led by <strong>Igor Kurchatov</strong>, built a replica of Enrico Fermi’s Chicago Pile Reactor in <strong>1946</strong> at <strong>Arzamas 16</strong> (formerly <strong>Serov</strong>).</li>
<li>By <strong>1949</strong>, the <strong>RDS-1 bomb</strong> (“<strong>Joe-1</strong>” to US intelligence) was ready for testing, a near copy of the US “Fat Man” bomb.</li>
<li>The successful detonation on <strong>August 29, 1949</strong>, in <strong>Kazakhstan</strong> yielded <strong>21 kilotons of TNT</strong>, ending the US nuclear monopoly and marking the beginning of the <strong>Cold War</strong>.</li>

<li>They established a <strong>plutonium production facility</strong> at <strong>Windscale</strong> on the Cumbrian coast, utilizing air-cooled reactors to vent exhaust over the Irish Sea.</li>
<li><strong>Plutonium production</strong> was accelerated by using short irradiation times, resulting in plutonium with high <strong>PU-240</strong> contamination, making bomb cores more hazardous.</li>

<li><strong>Argonne National Laboratory</strong> (from Enrico Fermi’s Metallurgical Lab)</li>
<li><strong>Los Alamos National Laboratory</strong></li>
<li><strong>Oak Ridge National Laboratory</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hanford Site</strong></li>

<li><strong>Savannah River Plant</strong> (mirroring Hanford)</li>
<li><strong>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</strong> (mirroring Los Alamos)</li>
<li><strong>Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant</strong> (mirroring Oak Ridge’s K-25)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Uranium ore</strong> was a critical resource.
<ul>
<li>In <strong>December 1949</strong>, the AEC set an <strong>artificially high price</strong> for uranium to encourage exploration and mining.</li>
<li>This triggered a <strong>uranium rush</strong>, particularly in the Four Corners region of the Colorado Plateau.</li>
<li><strong>Charles A. Steen</strong> discovered the massive <strong>Mi Vida uranium deposit</strong> in <strong>Utah</strong> in <strong>1952</strong>, significantly boosting US uranium reserves.</li>

<li>The US response was to pursue a more powerful weapon: the <strong>hydrogen bomb</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Edward Teller</strong>’s enthusiasm for <strong>hydrogen fusion weapons</strong> (“the super”) gained traction in the late 1940s.</li>
<li>Early <strong>computer simulations</strong> using <strong>ENIAC</strong> and the <strong>IBM Harvard Mark I</strong> proved Teller’s initial designs unworkable.</li>
<li><strong>Stanislaw Ulam</strong> proposed a modified design, separating the fission and fusion components and using the <strong>shockwave</strong> from the fission explosion to compress and heat the fusion fuel.</li>
<li>This led to the <strong>Teller-Ulam</strong> hydrogen bomb design.</li>
<li>Teller further refined the design, suggesting using <strong>X-rays</strong> from the fission explosion for compression.</li>
<li>The first hydrogen bomb test, <strong>Ivy Mike</strong> (“the Sausage”), took place on <strong>November 1, 1952</strong>, on <strong>Elugelab Island</strong> in the Pacific.

<ul>
<li><strong>Captain Hyman Rickover</strong> of the US Navy championed the development of a <strong>nuclear-powered submarine</strong>.</li>
<li>He challenged the conventional wisdom of using graphite reactors, recognizing their inherent safety limitations.</li>
<li>Rickover’s design utilized <strong>highly enriched uranium</strong> (50% U-235), eliminating the need for frequent refueling and allowing for a smaller reactor core.</li>
<li><strong>Ordinary water</strong> served as both moderator and coolant, providing a safety feature: loss of coolant also meant loss of moderation, leading to automatic shutdown.</li>
<li>The <strong>pressurized water reactor (PWR)</strong> design kept coolant under high pressure to prevent boiling, minimizing reactor size.</li>
<li>A <strong>closed primary cooling loop</strong> confined radioactivity, and a <strong>secondary loop</strong> transferred heat to a steam turbine, ensuring safety for maintenance.</li>

<li>Despite Edward Teller’s endorsement, the project initially stalled.</li>
<li>Rickover revitalized the program by repurposing funding from the <strong>Daniel’s Pile</strong> power plant project at Oak Ridge.</li>
<li>He secured the approval of <strong>Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz</strong>, Chief of Naval Operations, by crafting a letter for Nimitz to sign.</li>

<li><strong>The Wigner effect:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Predicted by <strong>Leo Szilard</strong> and <strong>Eugene Wigner</strong> during World War II.</li>
<li>High-speed neutrons, used for moderation, displace carbon atoms in the graphite’s crystal lattice.</li>
<li>This displacement can cause the graphite to change shape, potentially damaging the reactor’s precision.</li>
<li>Displaced carbon atoms store energy, which can be suddenly released, causing a fire.</li>

<li>Water is ineffective in extinguishing a graphite fire and can even worsen the situation by providing oxygen and releasing explosive hydrogen.</li>

<ul>
<li>Before Windscale Unit 1’s startup, Cockcroft raised concerns about the critical mass calculation, suggesting it could be off by as much as 250%.</li>
<li>Engineers sought ways to improve core reactivity by reducing neutron absorption.</li>
<li>They decided to shorten the aluminum fins on the fuel cartridges by 1/16th of an inch to reduce neutron absorption.</li>
<li>This modification, implemented by a team led by <strong>Tom Toohey</strong>, proved successful.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Windscale Unit 1 achieved criticality in October 1950, followed by Unit 2 in June 1951.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Toohey produced the first piece of plutonium metal in Great Britain on March 28, 1952.</strong></li>
<li>Despite some operational challenges, including concerns about fuel cartridge bursts, the reactors were deemed operational.</li>
<li>The <strong>Burst Cartridge Detection Gear (BCDG)</strong>, designed to detect ruptured fuel cartridges, had a tendency to damage the cartridges itself.</li>
<li>Unexplained temperature rises occurred in both units in 1952 but were managed by increasing blower speed.</li>

<ul>
<li>By October 1957, Windscale Unit 1 was due for its ninth graphite annealing, a routine procedure to release Wigner energy.</li>
<li><strong>The Annealing Process:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Main fans were turned off, allowing the core temperature to rise from its normal operating range (50-80°C) to approximately 250°C.</li>
<li>Thermocouples monitored the core temperature as Wigner energy was released.</li>
<li>The core was then cooled down using the blowers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Challenges arose due to the uneven distribution of the Wigner effect and cracks in some graphite bricks.</li>
<li><strong>The presence of polonium-210 and tritium production materials (AM and LM cans) was not considered to affect annealing.</strong></li>
<li><strong>October 7, 1957:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Annealing began at 11:45 a.m.</li>
<li>Control rods were slowly withdrawn to initiate nuclear heating.</li>
<li>Strange thermocouple readings led to temporary halts in rod withdrawal.</li>
<li>The pile reached criticality at 7:25 p.m.</li>
<li>Operators adjusted individual control rods to focus nuclear heating on the lower front of the pile.</li>

<li><strong>October 11, 1957:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Davey summoned Toohey, informing him of the fire.</li>
<li>Toohey observed the fire at the reactor face and the red glow at the back end of the core through an inspection hole.</li>
<li>The fire intensified, with flames changing from red to yellow and then to hot blue.</li>
<li>Toohey, despite the risks, instructed the <strong>Works Fire Brigade</strong> to stand by with equipment.</li>
<li>By midnight, the fire was contained to 120 fuel channels (out of 3,440) by creating a firebreak.</li>
<li>Workers used scaffolding poles to push burning fuel cartridges into a water trough at the back of the core.</li>

<li>Friday morning, when water was first applied to the fire.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The estimated release was at least 20,000 curies of radioactive material.</li>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>Sedan nuclear bomb test</strong> released 44 times more radiation.</li>
<li>The <strong>Chernobyl disaster</strong> released over 1,000 times more radiation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The radioactive plume primarily drifted over the Irish Sea.</li>
<li><strong>Iodine-131</strong>, with its short half-life but tendency to concentrate in the thyroid gland and milk, was a major concern.</li>
<li>The British government avoided mass evacuations but implemented measures to mitigate the impact of iodine-131 contamination.</li>
<li>Milk from surrounding areas was confiscated, diluted, and disposed of in the Irish Sea for a month.</li>
<li>Windscale Unit 2 was shut down.</li>

<li>Closed-loop circulation of pressurized water to prevent boiling.</li>
<li>Superheated water in the primary loop heats a secondary boiling water loop, generating steam for power production.</li>

<ul>
<li>Untermyer argued that the boiling moderator would enhance stability and control:

<li>Reduced fission rate stops boiling, bubbles collapse, moderator density increases, fission rate climbs, and boiling restarts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>BWR Self-Regulation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The BWR would be self-regulating, adjusting power output based on steam demand without constant control adjustments.</li>
<li>Increased steam demand cools the boiling action, increasing steam production.</li>

<li><strong>Georgia Gold Rush (1828):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gold discovered near Dalanega sparked the first US gold rush.</li>
<li>Over 300 ounces of gold extracted daily by 1830, leading to a population boom in Dahlonega (reaching 15,000).</li>
<li>Dawson Forest, rich in gold and water resources for ore processing, became a prime target for mining.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cherokee Removal:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Cherokee population residing on gold-rich land posed an obstacle to mining expansion.</li>
<li>The federal government intervened, condemning Cherokee farms and forcing them to relocate to Oklahoma via the Trail of Tears.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Georgia Gold Lottery (1832):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Following the Cherokee removal, the forest was divided into 40-acre lots and distributed through a lottery system to promote mining.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mining Legacy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Extensive excavation resulted in numerous mine shafts throughout the forest.</li>
<li>The Georgia Gold Belt produced approximately 870,000 troy ounces of gold.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-allure-of-future-technology">The Allure of Future Technology</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>C. L. Kelly Johnson</strong>, a renowned aeronautical engineer, was inspired by the Tom Swift Jr.&nbsp;stories, which depicted a future with flying cars and advanced technology.
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I read Tom Swift and his airship, Tom Swift and his electric runabout, Tom Swift and his submarine boat, and I said, that’s for me.” - C. L. Kelly Johnson</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The original <strong>Tom Swift Sr.</strong> series, introduced in 1910, featured gadgets like an electric runabout and a photo telephone, modeled after <strong>Thomas Edison</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Edison was a celebrated inventor who significantly shaped the 20th century with his inventions and the establishment of the <strong>Industrial Research Laboratory</strong>.</li>

<section id="the-rise-of-technological-utopianism" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-rise-of-technological-utopianism">The Rise of Technological Utopianism</h3>
<ul>
<li>The vision of a technologically advanced future gained momentum in the early 20th century and was further fueled by the Great Depression.
<ul>
<li>Science fiction flourished during this period, offering a hopeful escape from the hardships of the time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>H.G. Wells’ film “Things to Come” (1935)</strong> depicted a technological utopia and accurately predicted the onset of World War II and the Blitz.
<ul>
<li>The film’s <strong>Art Deco futuristic style</strong> influenced subsequent popular speculations about the future.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <strong>1939 World’s Fair</strong>, with its “I Have Seen the Future” pin and <strong>General Motors’ Futurama exhibit</strong>, further solidified the public’s vision of a technologically advanced future.
<ul>
<li><strong>Grover Whelan</strong>, a key organizer of the fair, coined the phrase “<strong>The World of Tomorrow.</strong>”</li>
<li><strong>Norman Bel Geddes’ streamlined modern designs</strong>, featured in the Futurama exhibit, became synonymous with the future aesthetic.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Geddes’ influence extended to various aspects of design, from trains and cars to radios and furniture, characterized by curved lines and rounded corners.
<ul>

<section id="wells-vision-and-its-influence" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wells-vision-and-its-influence">Wells’ Vision and its Influence</h3>
<ul>
<li>In “Things to Come,” Wells portrays a <strong>technocratic elite</strong> called “Wings Over the World,” a group of airmen who exemplify the emerging technological professional class.</li>
<li>Wells’ concept: This new class, possessing advanced scientific knowledge and skills, would naturally assume leadership after the decline of the old order.</li>
<li>Wells’ utopian vision includes:
<ul>
<li>A technocratic elite ruling over a scientifically advanced society.</li>
<li>Aggressive deployment of technology to solve global problems.</li>
<li>Victorian-style exploration and adventurism, prioritizing results over individual safety.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wells’ villains in “Things to Come” are the <strong>“do-nots,”</strong> individuals who are content with their comfortable lives and resist technological progress.
<ul>
<li>This conflict is not a social class struggle but a clash between those who embrace progress (“doers”) and those who oppose it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The “do-nots” represent a more nuanced version of the <strong>Eloi</strong> from Wells’ “The Time Machine,” highlighting the potential for societal stagnation due to prolonged comfort and safety.</li>
</ul>

<li>A 1944 review of two books, “Your World Tomorrow” and “Miracles Ahead,” titled “Green Light for the Age of Miracles,” exemplified this optimistic outlook.</li>
<li>The review highlighted predictions for transportation, including:
<ul>
<li>Cars with wings for air travel.</li>
<li>Helicopter “flivers” (small personal aircraft).</li>
<li>Affordable giant airliners enabling global travel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While flying cars and flivers remain unrealized, the prediction of affordable air travel has come true.</li>
<li>The books also accurately predicted other advancements:
<ul>
<li>High-octane gasoline, factory-built housing, portable radios, pocket-sized televisions, air conditioning, plastics, synthetic foods and materials, electronic cooking controls, fluorescent lights, and global tourism.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Detroit in 1960 was a symbol of American prosperity, with the automobile industry as its cornerstone.</li>
<li>By 2013, Detroit had filed for bankruptcy, facing widespread urban decay and economic hardship.</li>
<li><strong>Statistics on Detroit’s decline:</strong>
<ul>
<li>40% of street lamps don’t work.</li>
<li>210 of 317 public parks are permanently closed.</li>
<li>1-hour police response time to 911 calls.</li>
<li>Only a third of ambulances are drivable.</li>
<li>One-third of the city abandoned.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Quote:</strong> “To achieve this level of devastation, you usually have to be invaded by a foreign power.”</li>
<li>Detroit’s decline exemplifies a broader pessimism about the future, contrasting with the optimism of the early-to-mid 20th century.</li>

<li><strong>The Great Stagnation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tyler Cowen’s book <em>The Great Stagnation</em> (2011) argues that the US entered a period of economic slump in the 1970s after a period of rapid progress due to the exploitation of easily accessible technological advancements.</li>
<li>This stagnation is reflected in slow income growth and a decline in the “American Dream”.</li>
<li>Cowen uses median income rates as evidence, while Peter Turchin highlights the flatlining of unskilled labor wages.</li>
<li>Turchin observes a shift from an “integrative” to a “disintegrative” phase in various societal trends in the 1970s.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cost Disease:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> The phenomenon where the costs of essential goods and services (e.g., housing, education, healthcare) continue to rise in real terms, even after adjusting for inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Housing costs have doubled since the 1960s.</li>
<li>Primary education costs have tripled, without a corresponding increase in learning outcomes.</li>
<li>Healthcare costs have risen sixfold, while longevity growth has slowed.</li>
<li>College tuition and textbooks cost roughly ten times more.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Distinguishing from Efficiency-Driven Price Changes:</strong> Cost disease is distinct from situations where prices decrease due to increased efficiency (e.g., mass production).</li>
<li><strong>Secular Economic Decline:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Since the 1970s, actual economic growth has fallen below the historical trend line and has not recovered.</li>
<li>The per capita GDP growth rate dropped from 2.8% (pre-1970) to 1.9% (post-1970).</li>
<li>The post-war era (1945-1975) saw consistent economic growth, leading to optimistic projections that were not realized.</li>

<li><strong>Herbert Simon’s Prediction:</strong> Herbert Simon, in his 1966 book <em>The Shape of Automation</em>, predicted that average family income would reach $28,000 (1966 dollars) by the turn of the century, based on a 3% growth rate.</li>
<li><strong>Reality:</strong> Instead of the projected 3% growth, family income growth slowed to 0.5% in the following half-century.</li>
<li><strong>Factors Contributing to Slowdown:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The rise of single-parent households, leading to a loss of economic efficiencies associated with the traditional family structure.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> While individual indicators of stagnation might be debatable, the combined evidence suggests a significant slowdown in technological progress and economic growth since the 1970s.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="decline-of-the-private-airplane-industry">Decline of the Private Airplane Industry</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disappearance of the Industry:</strong> The private airplane industry, including companies like Cessna and Piper, experienced a significant decline starting in the late 1970s.</li>
<li><strong>The 1960s Boom:</strong> The 1960s was a period of growth for private aviation, with a wide variety of small family airplanes available.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of the Energy Crisis:</strong> The energy crisis of the 1970s temporarily impacted the industry, but it recovered within a few years.</li>
<li><strong>Current State:</strong> Today, only about 700 new piston airplanes, 400 turboprops, and 400 private jets are sold annually.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Costs:</strong> Due to limited demand, airplane prices have increased more than tenfold compared to the 1970s.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="flatlining-of-airliner-speeds">Flatlining of Airliner Speeds</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exponential Growth Followed by Plateau:</strong> Airliner speeds increased exponentially until the 1960s, then plateaued.</li>
<li><strong>Reasons for the Plateau:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physics and Economics:</strong> Flying just above Mach 1 is three times more expensive than flying just below it.</li>
<li><strong>Subsidized SST Projects:</strong> The Concorde and Tupolev Tu-144 supersonic transports were heavily subsidized national projects.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Engine Technology Continued to Advance:</strong> Despite the plateau in airliner speeds, engine technology continued to improve significantly.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> The de Havilland Ghost turbojet engine (1950s) had 5,000 pounds of thrust, while the GE-90 (1990s) had 115,000 pounds of thrust.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Unfulfilled Expectations:</strong> Based on the rapid progress in the first half of the 20th century, people in 1962 expected further significant increases in airliner speed, range, and capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Stagnation in Air Travel:</strong> Instead of further advancements, air travel has seen little improvement in the past 50 years, with some aspects even declining in the pursuit of fuel efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Market for Faster Travel:</strong> Despite the existence of technology for faster air travel, it has not been implemented, suggesting roadblocks beyond economic considerations.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Considerations:</strong> For long international flights, the energy required to fly through the atmosphere is comparable to that needed for orbital flight, which could be significantly faster.</li>
<li><strong>Iconic Example of Stagnation:</strong> The plateau in air travel serves as a representative example of the broader stagnation in life-improving technologies observed since the 1970s.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Analogy:</strong> The transition from wooden sailboats to steel steamships demonstrates that the adoption of more expensive technology can be justified by its superior performance.</li>

<p>“The coal output of the world, speaking roughly, doubled every ten years between 1840 and 1900, in the form of utilized power, for the ton of coal yielded three or four times as much power in 1900 as in 1840. Rapid as this rate of acceleration in volume seems, it may be tested in a thousand ways without greatly reducing it. Perhaps the ocean steamer is nearest unity and easiest to measure, for anyone might hire in 1905, for a small sum of money, the use of 30,000 steam horsepower to cross the ocean. And by halving this figure every ten years, he got back to 234 horsepower for 1835, which was accuracy enough for his purposes.” - Henry Adams</p>

<li><strong>The Henry Adams Curve:</strong> A historical trend of roughly 7% annual growth in usable energy available to civilization, observed since the early days of the steam engine.</li>
<li><strong>Factors Contributing to the Curve:</strong>
<ul>
<li>3% population growth.</li>
<li>2% energy efficiency growth.</li>
<li>2% growth in per capita energy consumption.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Flatlining of Energy Consumption:</strong> The Henry Adams curve plateaued in the 1970s, as shown by US energy consumption data.</li>
<li><strong>The 1970s Energy Crisis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The energy crisis was caused by Nixon’s price controls (1971), followed by the OPEC oil embargo (1973).</li>
<li>The Department of Energy (established 1977) is jokingly suggested to have been created to prevent energy use.</li>

<li><strong>Human Power vs.&nbsp;Modern Energy Use:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Before the Industrial Revolution, humans relied primarily on their own muscle power and animal power.</li>
<li>A human can produce about 100 watts of power daily.</li>

<li><strong>H.G. Wells</strong> predicted successful airplane flight before the year 2000. (Wells’ Anticipations, Circa 1900)</li>
<li>The scientific community, including astronomer <strong>Simon Newcomb</strong>, largely believed powered, heavier-than-air flight was impossible or at least a million years away. (New York Times, 1903)</li>
<li>Newcomb’s critiques, while ultimately incorrect, highlighted key challenges to be solved, such as:
<ul>
<li><strong>How to stop an airplane traveling at high speeds:</strong> “How is he ever going to stop?” (Newcomb, 1903)
<ul>
<li>Current airplanes use a “kludge” of descending to the ground at flying speed and slowing down on a runway.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-power-curve-and-energy-management">The Power Curve and Energy Management</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The key to flying is energy management.</strong></li>
<li>Airplanes require power to:
<ul>
<li><strong>Generate lift:</strong> Stay aloft.</li>
<li><strong>Overcome drag:</strong> Maintain speed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Three stores of energy</strong> power an airplane:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Provides a few seconds of flight.</li>
<li><strong>Altitude:</strong> Provides a few minutes of flight.</li>
<li><strong>Fuel:</strong> Provides a few hours of flight.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Takeoff, climb, and landing</strong> are phases of managing these energy stores.</li>
<li><strong>Landing</strong> is particularly problematic:
<ul>
<li>Descending directly downwards converts altitude energy into unwanted speed.</li>
<li>Requires a long, slanting approach to bleed off energy.</li>
<li>Airplanes must maintain flying speed until touchdown.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Induced drag</strong> (related to lift) decreases with increasing speed.</li>
<li><strong>Parasitic drag</strong> (related to other air disturbances) increases with increasing speed.</li>
<li>The <strong>power curve</strong> represents the total power needed to fly at different speeds.
<ul>
<li>Flying faster or slower than the optimal speed requires more power.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Birds</strong> can efficiently land because they can:
<ul>
<li>Spread their wings for high lift and high drag.</li>
<li>Flap vigorously to increase lift while slowing down.</li>
<li>Integrate thrust production with lift generation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fixed-wing airplanes</strong> cannot replicate this:
<ul>
<li>Increasing lift with the propeller also increases speed.</li>
<li>This creates a conflict during landing when slowing down is desired.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The closer flight technology can emulate birds, the closer we get to flying cars.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Charles Zimmerman</strong> (NACA) developed the <strong>Flying Pancake</strong> in the 1930s.
<ul>
<li>Goal: Create an airplane that could descend steeply at low speeds for easier landings, eliminating the need for long runways. (Zimmerman, 1932)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Willard R. Custer’s Channel Wing (CCW)</strong> aircraft used <strong>upper surface blowing</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Patented in 1929, flew in the 1940s.</li>
<li>CCW-5:

<li>5 passengers, 2.5 tons, 200 mph cruise speed.</li>
<li>35 mph flight speed, 250-foot takeoff roll.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Juan de la Cierva</strong> invented the <strong>autogyro</strong> in the early 1920s.
<ul>
<li>Goal: Solve the stall problem by making wings move fast even at low aircraft speeds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Autogyro features:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rotor blades</strong> act as the wing, generating lift.</li>
<li>Separate propeller provides thrust to overcome drag.</li>
<li><strong>Autorotation:</strong> Wind passing through the rotor disc causes the rotors to spin.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Innovations to overcome autogyro challenges:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dissymmetry of lift:</strong> Solved by using <strong>flapping hinges</strong> that allow blades to adjust their angle of attack.
<ul>
<li>Blades on the advancing side flap up, reducing lift; blades on the retreating side flap down, increasing lift.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Centrifugal force</strong> keeps the flapping blades extended outwards.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Development and Refinement:</strong>
<ul>
<li>De la Cierva refined the autogyro throughout the 1920s.</li>
<li><strong>Frank Courtney’s</strong> experience with blade breakage led to the addition of <strong>lead-lag hinges</strong> to accommodate blade acceleration and deceleration.</li>

<section id="waldos-origin-and-concept" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="waldos-origin-and-concept">Waldo’s Origin and Concept</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Robert A. Heinlein</strong>, writing as Anson MacDonald, introduced the <strong>Waldo F. Jones Synchronous Reduplicating Pantograph</strong> in a 1942 Astounding science fiction story.
<ul>
<li>This concept established Heinlein as the <strong>conceptual inventor of the telemanipulator</strong>, often referred to as a <strong>Waldo</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A <strong>Waldo</strong> is essentially a <strong>robot arm controlled remotely by a human operator</strong>, unlike programmed robots.
<ul>
<li><strong>Waldos</strong> emerged in the 1950s, driven by advancements in <strong>cybernetics and control theory</strong>, and the need to handle <strong>radioactive materials</strong> in the burgeoning <strong>nuclear field</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Heinlein’s original <strong>Waldos</strong> had two key features:
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-replicating and reduplicating.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Scale-shifting</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Waldo’s objective</strong> was to operate on individual nerve cells by creating a series of progressively smaller Waldos.
<ul>
<li>Existing tools, like <strong>electromagnetic instruments and neural surgery</strong>, lacked the precision for Waldo’s desired level of investigation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Waldo’s smallest Waldos</strong> at the time had <strong>half-inch palms</strong> and <strong>micro-scanners</strong>.
<ul>
<li>These were still too large for his purpose, leading him to use them to create even tinier Waldos.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Waldo’s final Waldos</strong> for nerve and brain surgery ranged from <strong>life-size mechanical hands</strong> to <strong>tiny “fairy digits”</strong> capable of manipulating objects invisible to the naked eye.
<ul>
<li>These were <strong>mounted in banks</strong> to work on the same area.</li>
<li>Waldo controlled them all from the same <strong>primary controls</strong>, switching sizes without removing his gauntlets.</li>
<li>Circuit changes automatically adjusted the <strong>scanning sweep and magnification</strong>, providing Waldo with a life-size image of his “other hands” in his stereo receiver.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Heinlein briefly addressed the challenge of <strong>visualization at smaller scales</strong> in a science fiction context, but lacked a detailed plan.
<ul>
<li>A more concrete solution would emerge nearly two decades later.</li>

<section id="feynmans-vision-nanotechnologys-genesis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feynmans-vision-nanotechnologys-genesis">Feynman’s Vision: Nanotechnology’s Genesis</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Richard Feynman</strong>, a physics professor at Caltech, likely encountered Heinlein’s Waldo story.
<ul>
<li><strong>Feynman’s academic background</strong> (MIT, Princeton, Los Alamos) placed him in environments with strong science fiction communities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In late 1959, Feynman repurposed the Waldo idea for an after-dinner speech at an <strong>American Physics Society conference</strong>.
<ul>
<li>He <strong>added detailed technological and scientific grounding</strong> to the concept, becoming intrigued by its potential.</li>
<li>This marked Feynman as the <strong>first to envision nanotechnology</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Feynman’s revolutionary insight</strong> led him to predict:
<ul>
<li>“In the year 2000, when they look back at this age, they will wonder why it was not until the year 1960 that anybody began seriously to move in this direction.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Feynman’s prediction was premature.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Serious progress in nanotechnology didn’t begin until the 1990s.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By 2000, <strong>atomic-scale electronic devices</strong> like <strong>molecular transistors</strong> existed, but <strong>complex circuits</strong> like nanocomputers were still 15 years away.</li>
<li>The missing element was the <strong>infrastructure</strong> that macroscopic technology relies on:
<ul>
<li><strong>Sorting and testing parts.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cutting and joining materials.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Creating frameworks for devices.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Placing parts into frameworks.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Feynman’s 1959 talk “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom” outlined a plan that could have achieved this infrastructure by 2000.</strong></li>
</ul>

<section id="feynmans-plan-top-down-approach" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feynmans-plan-top-down-approach">Feynman’s Plan: Top-Down Approach</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feynman’s talk proposed a “weird possibility” inspired by remote manipulators used in nuclear plants:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Build a <strong>master-slave system</strong> operating electrically.</li>
<li>Create <strong>precisely-made slave hands</strong> at one-quarter the scale of the master hands.</li>
<li>Use these smaller hands to manipulate <strong>quarter-sized tools and machines</strong>, including a <strong>quarter-size lathe</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat the process to create <strong>even smaller hands and tools</strong>, at one-sixteenth scale.</li>
<li><strong>Connect the large-scale system to the smallest servo motors</strong> through transformers for control.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Feynman’s core idea</strong> was to <strong>transition from macro-scale to nano-scale fabrication</strong> while maintaining general fabrication and manipulation capabilities, mirroring Waldo’s approach in Heinlein’s story.</li>
<li>Feynman acknowledged the difficulty but emphasized the <strong>possibility</strong> of this approach.</li>
<li>He offered <strong>$1,000 prizes</strong> for a <strong>tiny motor</strong> and <strong>tiny writing</strong>, aiming to stimulate interest.
<ul>
<li>The prizes were won, but <strong>Feynman’s vision failed to gain widespread traction</strong>.</li>

<section id="drexlers-vision-bottom-up-approach" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="drexlers-vision-bottom-up-approach">Drexler’s Vision: Bottom-Up Approach</h3>
<ul>
<li>Around 1976, <strong>K. Eric Drexler</strong>, an MIT undergraduate, envisioned building with <strong>designed protein molecules and other biomolecules</strong>.
<ul>
<li>He observed the <strong>mechanical and electronic functions of cellular components</strong> and questioned if humans could replicate such processes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By 1981, Drexler published a paper in the <strong>Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences</strong>, sparking the formation of a <strong>nanotechnology study group</strong> at MIT.</li>
<li>In 1986, Drexler and his group published <strong>Engines of Creation</strong>, introducing <strong>nanotechnology</strong> to a broader audience.</li>
<li><strong>Drexler’s approach</strong> differed from Feynman’s:
<ul>
<li><strong>Feynman’s was top-down</strong>, starting with machines and scaling down to atoms.</li>
<li><strong>Drexler’s was bottom-up</strong>, starting with biochemistry and scaling up to machines.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Both approaches ultimately aimed for <strong>molecular machines</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Feynman envisioned the physicist <strong>synthesizing anything</strong>.</li>
<li>Drexler described it as <strong>complete control of the structure of matter</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Interpreting these visions requires nuance.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Creating unstable atomic arrangements like exploding dynamite atom-by-atom is not feasible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>A reasonable interpretation</strong> focuses on <strong>rearranging existing atoms</strong>, exemplified by the hamburger analogy:
<ul>
<li>Eating a hamburger rearranges atoms without creating or destroying them.</li>
<li>A <strong>general synthesis capability</strong> would allow for transforming waste products back into the original hamburger.</li>
<li><strong>Current technology achieves this indirectly</strong> through agriculture and food processing.</li>
<li>A <strong>nanotechnological machine</strong> could achieve this directly at the molecular level.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>DNA</strong> has limitations: it cannot describe every possible atomic arrangement, only the linear sequence of amino acids in proteins.
<ul>
<li>However, <strong>amino acids can form diverse molecular machinery</strong>, performing life’s essential functions.</li>
<li>This parallels limitations in macroscopic technology, where machinists can create components but not infinitely complex shapes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Self-replication</strong> was an implicit concept in nanotechnology from the outset:
<ul>
<li>Heinlein explicitly mentioned “reduplicating”.</li>
<li>Feynman adopted this idea.</li>
<li>Drexler’s work stemmed from self-reproducing biological mechanisms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Nanotechnology surpasses limitations of cellular biochemistry</strong>:
<ul>
<li>It can operate <strong>without water</strong>, across a <strong>wider temperature range</strong>, and at <strong>higher speeds and power levels</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nanotechs-potential-incomprehensible-capabilities">Nanotech’s Potential: Incomprehensible Capabilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nanotechnology offers immense potential</strong> due to its ability to rearrange atoms.
<ul>
<li>The difference between <strong>charcoal and diamond, sand and computer chips, diseased and healthy tissue, and even life and death</strong> lies solely in atomic arrangement.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Drexler’s Engines of Creation</strong> paints a <strong>technophile’s dream</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Microscopic replicating units</strong> building <strong>skyscraper-sized objects</strong> with atomic precision.</li>
<li><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> and <strong>complex engineering systems</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Easy space travel</strong> with <strong>lightweight spacesuits</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Cell repair machines</strong> and the <strong>cure for aging</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Cryonics</strong> and <strong>resurrection</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Drexler’s vision</strong> expanded significantly on <strong>Feynman’s initial ideas</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Feynman focused on <strong>data storage</strong> and <strong>chemical synthesis</strong>.</li>
<li>Drexler explored the <strong>broader implications</strong> of “making absolutely anything”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Drexler’s projections</strong> were based on <strong>conservative engineering estimates</strong>.</li>
<li>Despite this, <strong>science fiction writers</strong> took the concept further, often with less scientific accuracy.
<ul>
<li>A 1989 Star Trek episode featured <strong>nanites evolving into an intelligent, coordinated species</strong> in a short timeframe, defying basic scientific principles.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Growing enthusiasm for nanotechnology</strong> led to increased hype and difficulty distinguishing serious research from fictionalized portrayals.</li>
<li>The <strong>technical world’s excitement</strong> was palpable:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Usenet Nanotechnology Discussion Group (Sci.Nanotech)</strong>, founded in 1989, received overwhelming support.</li>
<li>The <strong>first Foresight Conference on Nanotechnology</strong> in 1989 evoked comparisons to the historic <strong>Solvay Conferences</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Drexler’s influence</strong> on nanotechnology’s development in the 1980s and 1990s was substantial, exceeding that of Feynman or Heinlein.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-mightiest-machine-understanding-nanotechs-power">The Mightiest Machine: Understanding Nanotech’s Power</h3>
<ul>
<li>Grasping the <strong>raw power and potential of nanotechnology</strong> can be challenging.</li>
<li><strong>Drexler’s Nanosystems</strong> highlights the <strong>immense power density of nanomotors</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Greater than 10^15 watts per cubic meter</strong>.</li>
<li>For comparison, Earth receives about 10^17 watts of solar radiation.</li>
<li><strong>Cooling limitations</strong> prevent sustained operation at this density.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>This implies</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A <strong>1,000 horsepower (10^6 watts) engine</strong> could fit in a <strong>1 millimeter cube (10^-9 cubic meters)</strong>.</li>
<li>One cubic foot of nanomotors would require more power (10^13 watts) than all human machinery combined.</li>
<li>A <strong>Kardashev Type I civilization’s power needs (10^17 watts)</strong> could be met by nanomotors fitting in a 500-square-foot apartment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Jetsons’ world</strong> becomes more realistic than traditional futurism:
<ul>
<li><strong>Microscopic motors</strong> would be ubiquitous, seamlessly moving objects like biological muscles.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Miniaturization and speed</strong> are key advantages of nanotechnology:
<ul>
<li><strong>Smaller machines can operate faster</strong>, similar to the trend in electronics.</li>
<li><strong>Birds and insects</strong> demonstrate this principle with wing flapping speeds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Factory throughput</strong> is crucial for productivity:
<ul>
<li>A factory processing materials at walking speed (5 feet per second) across a mile takes 20 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Scaling down to cell size (microns)</strong> reduces processing time to <strong>microseconds</strong>.</li>
<li>This explains the <strong>vast difference in reproduction speeds</strong> between humans (20 years) and E. coli (20 minutes).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reproduction speed impacts economic growth</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A factory with a 3% annual return on investment takes 33 years to recoup its cost.</li>
<li><strong>Reinventing profits</strong> accelerates growth through <strong>compound interest</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Self-replicating factories</strong> dramatically change the equation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Replacing the US capital stock with mature nanotechnology</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Estimated time: <strong>about a week</strong>, based on calculations by Robert Freitas and the author.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This seemingly outlandish claim is supported by <strong>Nanosystems</strong> and <strong>molecular manufacturing research</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Analogy with information technology</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>power and sophistication of modern computers</strong> would seem “fantastic, ludicrous, insane” to someone from the 1960s.</li>
<li>The <strong>IBM 7094</strong>, used by NASA, had 0.35 MIPS and cost $35 million in today’s dollars.</li>
<li>A <strong>$35 Raspberry Pi</strong> in 2015 had 9,700 MIPS.</li>
<li>The author’s workstation has 2,356,230 MIPS.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-space-opera-to-soap-opera-the-machiavelli-effect">From Space Opera to Soap Opera: The Machiavelli Effect</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parallels with “The Skylark of Space”</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Both the fictional X and palladium are rare platinum group metals.</li>
<li>Both involve energy release through electrolysis.</li>
<li>In the novel, the fictional scientist Seton faces disbelief, theft, assassination attempts, and the abduction of his fiancée.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Machiavelli Effect in Science</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Richard Feynman</strong> emphasized the importance of admitting ignorance and uncertainty for scientific progress.</li>
<li><strong>Niccolo Machiavelli</strong>, in “The Prince” (1532), described the challenges faced by innovators who threaten the established order.
<ul>
<li>Innovators face strong opposition from those who benefit from the status quo and lukewarm support from potential beneficiaries.</li>
<li>This resistance can endanger the innovator and their supporters.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Evidence of the Machiavelli Effect in Cold Fusion</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Scientists with ties to <strong>hot fusion</strong> research were particularly critical of cold fusion.</li>
<li>The <strong>Department of Energy (DOE)</strong> formed a committee (<strong>ERAB</strong>) to investigate cold fusion in April 1989.
<ul>
<li>The committee leadership had strong connections to nuclear weapons research.</li>
<li>The report, while not entirely dismissive, was interpreted as such.</li>
<li><strong>John Huizenga</strong> wrote a book debunking cold fusion, leveraging his position as committee chairman.</li>
<li>The report acknowledged the impossibility of definitively proving or disproving all claims.</li>
<li>It listed 11 positive and 13 negative experiments for excess heat.</li>
<li>At least one credible positive result from NASA was overlooked.</li>
<li>A later positive result from the Naval Air Warfare Center was initially listed as negative.</li>
<li>The evidence for excess heat was arguably balanced, if not slightly favoring cold fusion.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Role of Politics and Funding</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Superconducting Supercollider (SSC)</strong> project was competing for funding at the time.</li>
<li>Cold fusion posed a potential threat to the SSC’s funding and the prestige of high-energy physics.</li>
<li>The <strong>Machiavelli effect</strong> explains the biased reaction, as the scientific establishment sought to protect its interests.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Examples of Bias</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center</strong> reported no excess heat, but their experimental setup was flawed.
<ul>
<li><strong>Peter Hagelstein</strong> pointed out the significantly higher measurement errors in the MIT experiments compared to Fleischmann and Pons’s work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The emotional and dismissive language used by some scientists against cold fusion proponents further suggests bias.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Impact of the ERAB Report</strong>:
<ul>
<li>By November 1989, the scientific community largely dismissed cold fusion.</li>
<li>Fleischmann and Pons’s detailed paper was published only then, making proper replication attempts possible.</li>
<li>The <strong>Machiavelli effect</strong> was in full force, hindering further research.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Continued Suppression of Research</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Hagelstein’s experience with a company interested in funding cold fusion research demonstrates ongoing resistance.
<ul>
<li>A prominent physicist at MIT intervened, canceling the program and jeopardizing the careers of researchers involved.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Implications of the Machiavelli Effect</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The attacks on cold fusion may not have been solely based on scientific merit.</li>
<li>There is a high prior probability of bias due to the political and financial stakes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenges in Cold Fusion Research</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The field is plagued by unreliable claims from less credible sources.</li>
<li>Replication is difficult, increasing the risk of self-deception among researchers.</li>
<li>Cold fusion is often associated with pseudoscience and fringe ideas, further damaging its reputation.</li>
<li>The constant barrage of unsubstantiated claims makes it difficult for scientists to differentiate potentially valid research.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Exploring the Impossible</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Arthur C. Clarke</strong>: “The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.”</li>
<li>Many scientific and technological advancements resulted from challenging established limits.</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="aftermath-and-current-status">Aftermath and Current Status</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lessons Learned</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Fleischmann and Pons’s focus on fusion products, an area outside their expertise, made them vulnerable to criticism.</li>
<li>They should have emphasized the observed heat amplification instead.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The National Cold Fusion Institute</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Founded at the University of Utah with $4.5 million in funding.</li>
<li>Failed to produce significant results and closed within a year.</li>
<li>Legal disputes surrounding the institute cost five times more than the research itself.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Further Research Efforts</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Toyota invested $40 million in Fleischmann and Pons’s research at IMRA Europe, with limited success.</li>
<li>Japan’s MITI spent $20 million, also with no breakthroughs.</li>
<li>These efforts did lead to a gradual improvement in producing the effect, but reliability remained elusive.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Difficulties in Replication</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Richard Oriani</strong> described cold fusion experiments as the most challenging of his career.</li>
<li>Replication remains extremely difficult, requiring specific conditions and materials.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Progress in Understanding</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Michael McKubre</strong>’s research at SRI International showed that a deuterium loading ratio of at least 90% in palladium is crucial.</li>
<li>The quality of palladium samples is also a significant factor.</li>
<li><strong>Dennis Cravens</strong> and <strong>Edmund Storms</strong> found that only a small percentage of palladium samples are effective.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Department of Energy Review (2004)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Another ERAB review was conducted, resulting in a non-committal report.</li>
<li>An analysis of reviewers’ comments suggests a slight lean towards the possibility of excess heat and nuclear phenomena, but not strong support.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ongoing Research</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Despite limited funding and skepticism, research continues at NASA, the Navy, and DARPA.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Significance of Cold Fusion</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Cold fusion, even if not a guaranteed energy solution, highlights potential gaps in our understanding of physics.</li>
<li>The suppression of research exemplifies the <strong>Machiavelli effect</strong>, hindering scientific progress in various fields.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Due to the <strong>Machiavelli effect</strong>, the viability of cold fusion as an energy source remains uncertain.</li>
<li>The controversy has cast a shadow on the openness and objectivity of the scientific establishment.</li>
<li>Many promising avenues of research may be suppressed due to similar biases</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Thomas Kuhn</strong>, in “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,” argues that members of mature scientific communities are victims of history rewritten by those in power.
<ul>
<li>Similar to characters in Orwell’s “1984.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By 1989, the consensus was that <strong>cold fusion</strong> was a mistake due to misinterpretations and poor lab techniques.</li>
<li>The author initially accepted this consensus.</li>
<li>Decades later, after encountering the <strong>Machiavelli Effect</strong> in <strong>nanotechnology</strong>, the author reconsidered cold fusion.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-machiavelli-effect-in-nanotechnology">The Machiavelli Effect in Nanotechnology</h3>
<ul>
<li>The resistance to innovation in nanotechnology was less intense than in cold fusion.</li>
<li><strong>Nanotechnology</strong> gained prominence in the 1990s.
<ul>
<li><strong>Eric Drexler</strong>’s 1991 MIT dissertation, the first explicitly on nanotechnology, provided a theoretical basis for its manufacturing capabilities.</li>
<li>Republished as “Nanosystems” in 1992, it became a bestseller.</li>
<li>The Foresight Institute’s nanotechnology conferences grew, attracting top researchers.</li>
<li><strong>Richard Feynman</strong>’s “Plenty of Room” (1960) gained recognition in the late 1990s.</li>
<li>In 1997, Nobel laureate <strong>Richard Smalley</strong> (discoverer of C60) was the Foresight Institute’s keynote speaker.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By 2000, nanotechnology gained political attention.
<ul>
<li>President Clinton proposed a <strong>National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI)</strong>, citing Feynman’s work.</li>

<section id="machiavellis-two-classes-the-nni" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="machiavellis-two-classes-the-nni">Machiavelli’s Two Classes &amp; The NNI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Machiavelli</strong> identified two classes:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Nobles:</strong> Those who benefit from the status quo and have the laws on their side. They tend to be politically and economically powerful.</li>
<li><strong>Tradesmen:</strong> Those who would benefit from innovation but fear the risks associated with challenging the nobles.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The NNI did not introduce new funding but redistributed existing funds, creating a Machiavelli Effect scenario.
<ul>
<li><strong>Nobles:</strong> Established researchers in related fields (e.g., surface and materials science).</li>
<li><strong>Tradesmen:</strong> Researchers who could potentially work on true nanotech but were working in other areas or were still students.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Nobles’ Reaction:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Labeled their existing work as nanotechnology.</li>
<li>Attacked Drexler’s (and implicitly Feynman’s) vision.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Tradesmen’s Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hesitated to embrace the new field due to its perceived difficulty and the risk of attacks from established researchers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consequences:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Innovation slowed down.</li>
<li>This dynamic is common in zero-sum science and technology funding environments.</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-machiavelli-effect-as-a-systemic-immune-response">The Machiavelli Effect as a Systemic Immune Response</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Machiavelli Effect is not a conspiracy but a natural human response to protect one’s interests.</li>
<li>It’s akin to a <strong>social and economic system’s immune response</strong>.</li>
<li>It’s a part of <strong>normal science</strong> as described by Thomas Kuhn.</li>
<li><strong>Isaac Asimov</strong> observed similar resistance to technological change throughout history:
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I discovered, to my amazement, that all through history there had been resistance, and bitter, exaggerated, last-ditch resistance, to every significant technological change that had taken place on Earth. Usually, the resistance came from those groups who stood to lose influence, status, money as a result of the change. Although they never advanced this as their reason for resisting it, it was always the good of humanity that rested upon their hearts.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>By the early 2000s, the NNI led to a full-fledged Machiavelli Effect in nanotechnology.
<ul>
<li>Researchers working on molecular machines faced funding difficulties due to partisan attacks.</li>
<li>A productive nanotech program at NASA Ames was canceled.</li>
<li>Foresight Institute experienced difficulty attracting researchers who had previously presented work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The attacks lacked intellectual substance.
<ul>
<li>Smalley, a prominent attacker, contradicted himself on the feasibility of molecular self-replication.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Machiavelli’s prediction of the 20th-century behavior of nanoscience leaders does not invalidate nanotechnology itself.</li>
<li>It highlights the possibility of partisan influence in attacks on new ideas.</li>
<li>In Bayesian terms, the prior probability of such attacks was high regardless of the validity of Drexler’s or Feynman’s vision.</li>

<section id="the-machiavelli-effect-beyond-physical-science" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-machiavelli-effect-beyond-physical-science">The Machiavelli Effect Beyond Physical Science</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Machiavelli Effect is not limited to physical sciences and engineering.</li>
<li>It’s arguably less prevalent in these fields compared to others.</li>
<li><strong>George Miller</strong> (cognitive psychologist) described the difficulty of challenging behaviorism’s dominance in psychology:
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The power, the honors, the authority, the textbooks, the money, everything in psychology was owned by the behavioristic school. Those of us who wanted to be scientific psychologists couldn’t really oppose it. You just wouldn’t get a job.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Distinguishing between the Machiavelli Effect and legitimate criticism of flawed ideas can be challenging.</li>
<li><strong>Textbook knowledge</strong> is generally “probably approximately correct.”</li>
<li>But in some cases (e.g., flying machines), expert consensus has been wrong.</li>
<li>The bureaucratic resistance to innovators can be detrimental to scientific progress.</li>

<ul>
<li>In 1910, the Wright brothers offered their <strong>Wright Flyer</strong> (the first successful heavier-than-air flying machine) to the Smithsonian.</li>
<li>Their offer was rejected.</li>
<li>The Flyer was eventually donated to the Science Museum in London (until 1948).</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the Smithsonian exhibited <strong>Samuel Langley</strong>’s <strong>Aerodrome</strong> as the first flying machine.
<ul>
<li>Langley, a former Smithsonian director, had received significant government funding for his failed attempts at flight.</li>
<li>In 1914, the Smithsonian lent the Aerodrome to <strong>Glenn Curtiss</strong>, who modified and successfully flew it.</li>
<li>Curtiss was a competitor of the Wrights and sought to invalidate their airplane patent.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Funding Disparity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Wrights spent about $1,000 of their own money to build the Flyer.</li>
<li>Langley received over $50,000 in government funding for his unsuccessful Aerodrome.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-public-good-of-basic-research-funding-trends">The Public Good of Basic Research &amp; Funding Trends</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scientists generally believe that <strong>basic research</strong> is a <strong>public good</strong>, providing broad benefits that outweigh its costs.
<ul>
<li>Its benefits are so widespread that no individual has a private incentive to fund it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author initially shared this belief and conducted federally funded research.</li>
<li>Research funding trends fluctuate (e.g., the <strong>AI winter</strong> in the 1980s).</li>
<li>The author initially assumed funding agencies simply misunderstood the potential of certain fields.</li>
<li>The nanotechnology experience changed the author’s perspective.</li>
<li>The deliberate distortion of nanotech’s core concept (as envisioned by Heinlein, Feynman, and Drexler) raised doubts about the top-down funding process’s ability to advance science, technology, and society.</li>
<li><strong>Government Funding and Innovation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The $50,000 Langley received for the Aerodrome was exceptional before 1940.</li>
<li>The <strong>Manhattan Project</strong> (billions of dollars, massive industrial effort, successful outcome) changed perceptions about government-funded research.</li>
<li>Its success and the subsequent advancements in aircraft and missile research convinced many that federal funding could accelerate scientific progress and economic growth.</li>
<li>Defense research funding became entrenched.</li>
<li>Non-defense research spending increased in the 1960s, primarily for the space program.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Private Sector Innovation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Major quality-of-life improvements before 1960 (refrigerators, freezers, vacuum cleaners, stoves, washing machines, indoor plumbing, detergents, electric lights, cars, trucks, tractors, fertilizer, air travel, containerized freight, vacuum tubes, transistors, telegraph, telephone, phonograph, movies, radio, television) were primarily developed privately.</li>

<ul>
<li>The belief that increased federal funding for scientific research would boost economic growth became widespread.</li>
<li><strong>Evidence Against This Belief:</strong>
<ul>
<li>England, where the Industrial Revolution began, had minimal public research support in the 19th century.</li>
<li>France and Germany, with strong public scientific enterprises, did not experience comparable economic growth.</li>
<li>The US, with a laissez-faire approach, surpassed Britain’s GDP per capita.</li>
<li>Public R&amp;D funding coincided with the <strong>Great Stagnation</strong>, a period of slowed technological innovation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>OECD Study (2005):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Found a positive correlation (0.26) between private R&amp;D and economic growth.</li>
<li>Found a negative correlation (-0.37) between government-funded R&amp;D and economic growth.</li>
<li>Authors suggested that public R&amp;D might <strong>crowd out</strong> private sector resources, including private R&amp;D.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Crowding Out vs.&nbsp;The Machiavelli Effect:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some economists (e.g., Terence Keeley) favor the crowding-out explanation.</li>
<li>The author argues that the Machiavelli Effect also plays a significant role.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Counterarguments to Cowen’s Hypothesis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The decline in manufacturing jobs continued well into the 2000s, freeing up workers for other sectors.</li>
<li>The US consistently produces more manufactured goods with fewer workers.</li>
<li>There is significant potential for increased production (e.g., flying cars) if desired.</li>
<li>The <strong>feminist revolution</strong> doubled the pool of educated young people.</li>
<li>Women’s participation in higher education increased significantly (e.g., PhDs awarded to women).</li>
<li>PhDs awarded per year increased dramatically compared to the 1950s and early 20th century.</li>

<li><strong>Ivory Tower Syndrome Hypothesis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Suggests that excessive education might hinder the economy and technological innovation.</li>
<li>Too many young people are in academia instead of pursuing real-world endeavors.</li>

<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“But there’s a tension here that Tyler doesn’t address. Technology grew like gangbusters in the first half of the 20th century, but it wasn’t until the second half that education took off.

<ul>
<li><strong>Arthur C. Clarke</strong> (“Profiles of the Future”) identified two types of failure in technological forecasting:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Failure of Nerve:</strong> Occurs when the science and engineering are understood, but the predicted outcome is too unconventional.
<ul>
<li>Example: The scientific community’s denial of heavier-than-air flight (even after the Wright brothers’ success).</li>
<li><strong>Simon Newcomb</strong>’s argument against airplanes (falling out of the sky when they stopped) exemplifies a failure of nerve.</li>
<li>He failed to consider the possibility of runways for takeoff and landing.</li>
<li><strong>Arthur C. Clarke</strong> encountered similar resistance in the field of rocketry.</li>
<li><strong>New York Times Editorial (1920):</strong>
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“That Professor Goddard, with his chair in Clark College and the countenancing of the Smithsonian Institution, does not know the relation of action and reaction, and of the need to have something better than a vacuum against which to react, to say that would be absurd. Of course, he only seems to lack the knowledge ladled out daily in high schools.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The editorial displays arrogance and ignorance.</li>
<li>It illustrates the potential for influential figures to stifle innovation through biased funding decisions.</li>
<li>The Times retracted the claim in 1969 during the Apollo 11 mission:
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Isaac Newton in the 17th century, and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere. The Times regrets the error.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Nanotechnology as a Modern Example:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Standard physics, chemistry, and quantum mechanics predict the feasibility of atomically precise machines.</li>
<li>The failure of nerve is essentially thinking within limitations that do not actually exist.</li>
<li><strong>Feynman</strong>’s breakthrough was recognizing the potential of manipulating matter at the atomic level.</li>
<li><strong>Drexler</strong> further weakened the resistance by drawing parallels with molecular machines in cells.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Failure of Imagination:</strong> Occurs when the knowledge required to make accurate predictions is simply unavailable.
<ul>
<li>Example: <strong>Ernest Rutherford</strong>’s dismissal of atomic energy:
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The energy produced by the breaking down of the atom is a very poor kind of thing. Anyone who expects a source of power from transformation of these atoms is talking moonshine.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rutherford, a leading nuclear physicist, was unaware of the neutron and nuclear fission, concepts that were unknown at the time.</li>
<li>Failures of imagination are difficult to identify except in hindsight.</li>
<li>It’s essential to acknowledge the existence of unknown unknowns.</li>
<li>Technological progress often involves venturing beyond the known.</li>
<li><strong>Crystal Radio Example:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Someone familiar with crystal radios might have envisioned the transistor, not through knowledge of quantum mechanics, but by recognizing the possibility of undiscovered solid-state phenomena.</li>

<li><p><strong>Shift in Focus:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A century ago, talented individuals faced real-world challenges, leading to innovative solutions.</li>
<li>Today, many of their successors are trapped in academia, focused on securing funding rather than addressing practical problems.</li>

<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-shift-from-science-to-emotionalism">The Shift from Science to Emotionalism</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The 17th-century Scientific Revolution:</strong> Isaac Newton’s discoveries in motion, gravitation, and calculus built upon the work of previous scientists, marking a shift in understanding the universe from anthropomorphic gods to logic, mathematics, observation, and experiment.</li>
<li><strong>The Beauty and Value of Science:</strong> Science builds upon itself, incorporating insights from previous generations, unlike other forms of knowledge.
<ul>
<li>Example: Ptolemy’s epicycles predicted planetary positions, while Newton’s celestial mechanics allowed for the discovery of Neptune based on observations of Uranus.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Scientific and Technological Progress until the 1960s:</strong> Knowledge and capabilities continued to grow, culminating in the moon landing, driven by celestial mechanics and Newton’s third law.</li>
<li><strong>The Age of Aquarius and the Decline of Science:</strong> The 1960s saw a cultural shift away from scientific reasoning towards emotionalism, symbolized by the “Age of Aquarius.”
<ul>
<li>Example: The movie “Flash Gordon” (1974) mirrored the cultural atmosphere of the 1970s, emphasizing sexual liberation and a departure from traditional values.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>H.G. Wells’ “The Time Machine” (1895) Foreshadowed the Cultural Shift:</strong> Wells described a future society, the Eloi, characterized by a decline in strength, intelligence, and vigor due to a life of ease and security.
<ul>
<li><strong>Strength as a Consequence of Need:</strong> Wells argued that hardship and freedom fostered strength, intelligence, and cooperation, while security led to feebleness.</li>
<li><strong>The Fate of Energy in Security:</strong> Wells suggested that in a secure society, energy is diverted towards art and eroticism, eventually leading to languor and decay.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Wells’ Predictions about the Sexual Revolution and Family Breakdown:</strong> Wells anticipated the shift away from traditional family structures and the embrace of sexual liberation.</li>
<li><strong>The Rapid Pace of Societal Transformation:</strong> The cultural changes Wells predicted occurred within a century, much faster than the 8,000 centuries he envisioned.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The 1960s as a Cultural Phase Change:</strong> Western culture, particularly in America, underwent a significant transformation in the 1960s and 70s.
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples of Cultural Movements:</strong> Hippies, Woodstock, environmentalism, Earth Day, free love, zero population growth, civil rights, passivism, and feminism.</li>
<li><strong>Similarities to the Bloomsbury Set:</strong> The 1960s counterculture echoed sentiments of the earlier Bloomsbury Group in London, but on a much larger scale.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Mimetic Cambrian Explosion of the 1960s:</strong> The simultaneous emergence of various social and cultural revolutions can be seen as a mimetic Cambrian explosion.
<ul>
<li><strong>Preexisting Concerns:</strong> Many of the issues championed by the counterculture had existed before the 1960s (e.g., slavery, women’s suffrage, free love, conservationism).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Question of Simultaneous Revolutions:</strong> The key question is why all these movements converged and intensified in the 1960s.
<ul>
<li><strong>Analogy of Flowers in the Desert:</strong> The widespread emergence of social movements suggests a common underlying cause, like rain in a desert causing widespread blooming.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs as an Explanation:</strong> Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs can help explain the cultural shift of the 1960s.
<ul>
<li><strong>Hierarchy Levels:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Basic needs: Physical safety, food, clothing, shelter.</li>
<li>Social needs: Friendship, status.</li>
<li>Higher needs: Spiritual fulfillment, self-actualization.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Motivation and Hierarchy:</strong> Individuals are motivated by the lowest unmet need in the hierarchy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Western Culture’s Fulfillment of Lower-Level Needs:</strong> By the 1960s, Western culture had largely fulfilled the basic needs of its citizens, allowing them to focus on higher-level needs.</li>
<li><strong>The Modern Elite and Higher-Level Needs:</strong> The “modern elite” could take basic needs for granted and focus on love, esteem, self-actualization, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Emancipation of Women and Technological Advancements:</strong> Labor-saving machines of the 20th century freed women from some domestic drudgery, allowing them to pursue other interests.
<ul>
<li>Example: The character of Stella in “The Jetsons” (1962) represented this shift, although it was still emerging at the time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rising Productivity and the “Good Life”:</strong> Increased productivity throughout the 19th and 20th centuries led to a higher standard of living, making the “good life” accessible to more people.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Medieval Europe and the Constant Threat of War:</strong> Medieval life was shaped by the constant presence of war, creating an evolutionary pressure for moral codes that prioritized productivity, efficiency, hard work, and the needs of the polity over the individual.</li>
<li><strong>The Forging of Western Civilization:</strong> This pressure shaped Western civilization, promoting values that led to a better standard of living and the development of science.</li>
<li><strong>The Impact of Nuclear Weapons on Warfare:</strong> The advent of nuclear weapons and the concept of mutually assured destruction (MAD) fundamentally changed the nature of warfare.
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-Circuiting the Evolutionary Process:</strong> MAD removed the pressure on societies to maintain efficient cultural and governmental practices for survival.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Nuclear Umbrella and the Cambrian Explosion of Eloi:</strong> The nuclear umbrella allowed societies with less efficient practices to survive, leading to a proliferation of “Eloi” (those focused on higher-level needs).</li>
<li><strong>Proxy Wars and Reduced Societal Pressure:</strong> Wars like the Korean War became proxy conflicts, reducing the direct pressure on American society compared to World War II.</li>
<li><strong>Peter Turchin’s Historical Analysis:</strong> Historian Peter Turchin observed a pattern of empires becoming complacent and vulnerable to internal decay when their survival is no longer threatened.</li>
<li><strong>The Vietnam War and the Decline of Technological Optimism:</strong> The Vietnam War, perceived as cruel and useless, contributed to a decline in American faith in technological progress and military strength.</li>
<li><strong>World War II’s Influence on Post-War Culture:</strong> The experience of World War II shaped American culture and institutions, promoting a belief in centralized bureaucratic government and fostering a cooperative spirit.</li>
<li><strong>The Unsustainability of the 1950s Boom:</strong> The post-war boom of the 1950s relied on the cooperative spirit inherited from the war, which began to fade in subsequent generations.</li>
<li><strong>The Baby Boomers and the Two Cultures:</strong> The baby boomer generation split into two distinct cultures with differing values and worldviews, exemplified by the contrasting responses to the Apollo 11 moon landing and Woodstock.</li>
<li><strong>The Corporate State and the Age of Aquarius:</strong> The centralized corporate state that worked with the cooperative Greatest Generation struggled to adapt to the individualistic and rebellious spirit of the Age of Aquarius.</li>
<li><strong>Science Fiction’s Misjudgment of Societal Progress:</strong> Science fiction writers often assumed that social decision-making would become more scientific and rational, failing to anticipate the cultural shift towards emotionalism and individualism.</li>
<li><strong>The Role of Ease and Plenty in Moral and Intellectual Decay:</strong> Contrary to some post-apocalyptic narratives, it was ease and abundance, not hardship, that fostered moral and intellectual decline.</li>
<li><strong>The Limitations of War as a Shaper of Culture:</strong> War is no longer a viable mechanism for shaping culture due to the destructive potential of modern technology.</li>
<li><strong>The Question of Corrective Mechanisms for False Beliefs:</strong> In the absence of war, it is unclear what mechanisms will correct societal false beliefs.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Modern Eloi’s Perception of Struggle:</strong> Despite living in relative ease and security, many people today perceive their lives as a struggle and believe they are contributing to something meaningful.</li>
<li><strong>Maslow’s Hierarchy and the Need for Belonging and Esteem:</strong> The need for belonging and esteem drives individuals to seek purpose and validation in their lives.</li>
<li><strong>The Human Psyche’s Resistance to Uselessness:</strong> Humans are psychologically averse to a life devoid of purpose and contribution to others, as depicted in Wells’ portrayal of the Eloi.</li>
<li><strong>The Post-Industrial Age’s Fulfillment of the Need for Meaning:</strong> The post-industrial age has created a system where people can believe they are doing important work even when it is not objectively productive.</li>
<li><strong>The Illusion of Progress and Societal Stagnation:</strong> While the Great Stagnation indicates a decline in actual progress, many believe they are making the world a better place.</li>
<li><strong>The Shift from Conquering the Physical World to Conquering Minds:</strong> The focus has shifted from technological advancement to influencing the beliefs and behaviors of others.</li>
<li><strong>The Role of Emotion and Self-Deception:</strong> In this new struggle, objective truth is often disregarded in favor of emotional appeals and self-deception.</li>
<li><strong>The Evolutionary Basis for Self-Deception:</strong> Humans have evolved the ability to deceive themselves as a means of more effectively deceiving others.
<ul>
<li><strong>Research on Self-Deception:</strong> The work of Robert Trivers and Robin Hanson highlights the evolutionary advantages of self-deception.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Literature’s Exploration of Self-Deception:</strong> The theme of self-deception and hypocrisy is prevalent in literature, showcasing our tendency to distort reality to maintain a positive self-image.
<ul>
<li>Example: T.S. Eliot’s observation about people’s desire to feel important and their capacity for self-justification.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Rise of Science and the Advantage of Truth:</strong> Science emerged because, in specific historical contexts, knowing the objective truth became more advantageous than not knowing it.</li>
<li><strong>The Rise of Virtue Signaling and Cost Disease:</strong> Today, many social institutions gain prestige through virtue signaling rather than demonstrable results, leading to cost disease in areas like healthcare, education, and environmental regulation.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Homeostasis and Risk Compensation:</strong> People tend to maintain a constant level of perceived risk, adjusting their behavior to compensate for changes in actual risk.
<ul>
<li><strong>The Peltzman Effect:</strong> Introducing safety features can lead to riskier behavior, as people compensate to maintain their preferred risk level.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Societal Risk Homeostasis and the Appeal of Scare Stories:</strong> The decline in perceived exogenous risk after World War II may have led to increased susceptibility to scare stories, such as those related to environmental hazards.</li>
<li><strong>The Correlation between Energy Intensity and Failed Predictions:</strong> Technologies with higher energy intensity are easier to portray as dangerous and are further removed from everyday experience, making them more susceptible to scare stories.
<ul>
<li>Example: Cell phones vs.&nbsp;nuclear reactors – personal experience with cell phones counteracts scare stories, while the lack of experience with nuclear power makes it easier to believe exaggerated risks.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Rise of Environmentalism as a Religion:</strong> The decline of organized religion has been accompanied by the rise of environmentalism, which, in its extreme form, can be considered a religion.
<ul>
<li><strong>John Burroughs’ Observation:</strong> Burroughs noted the increasing tendency to treat nature as a temple.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Homeostasis in the Human Psyche for Religion:</strong> The human psyche appears to have a need for religious or spiritual belief systems, which environmentalism may be fulfilling for some.</li>
<li><strong>Bill McKibben’s Biocentrism:</strong> McKibben’s writings express a biocentric worldview, where human impact on nature is inherently bad, regardless of observable consequences.
<ul>
<li><strong>“The End of Nature”:</strong> McKibben lamented the loss of nature’s independence and mystery due to human influence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Doctrine of Original Sin on Steroids:</strong> This view can be seen as an extreme version of the doctrine of original sin, where humanity’s very existence is seen as a blight on nature.</li>
<li><strong>Calls for Human Extinction:</strong> Some environmental extremists advocate for human extinction as a solution to environmental problems.
<ul>
<li>Example: David Graeber’s hope for a virus to eliminate humanity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Green Religion’s Dominance in Western Culture:</strong> The green religion has become the default belief system for many in Western civilization, particularly in academia.</li>
<li><strong>Climate Change as the Central Focus:</strong> Climate change has become the central apocalyptic narrative of the green religion.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Baptists and Bootleggers Analogy:</strong> The climate change debate can be understood through the “Baptists and bootleggers” framework from public choice theory, where seemingly opposed groups support the same policies for different reasons.</li>
<li><strong>The Dark Green Religion and Climate Science:</strong> The dark green true believers, like the Baptists, are motivated by moral and religious convictions, while scientists and renewable energy entrepreneurs, like the bootleggers, may benefit from climate concern.</li>
<li><strong>The Reversal of the Baptists and Bootleggers Dynamic:</strong> Unlike the original analogy, where bootleggers pretended to be Baptists, in the climate change debate, the Baptists (dark green activists) often pretend to be bootleggers (scientists) to gain wider support.</li>
<li><strong>The Distortion of Scientific Findings:</strong> This dynamic can lead to the exaggeration of climate change’s risks and the suppression of dissenting scientific views.</li>
<li><strong>The Negative Impacts of Agriculture and Highways on Habitat:</strong> The author notes that agriculture and highways are major contributors to habitat destruction, but these are often overlooked in favor of focusing on energy production.</li>
<li><strong>The Paradox of Opposition to Nuclear Power:</strong> The green movement’s opposition to nuclear power, a clean energy source, is paradoxical given their concern for habitat destruction.</li>
<li><strong>The Prevalence of “Schrodinger’s Cats”:</strong> The author suggests that many individuals hold contradictory beliefs, supporting green causes while also engaging in activities that harm the environment.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ergophobia: The Fear of Work/Energy:</strong> Ergophobia is the irrational fear of work, which can be extended to mean the fear of using energy.</li>
<li><strong>The Origins of Ergophobia:</strong> Ergophobia in American culture predates climate change concerns, as seen in the anti-nuclear power movement.</li>
<li><strong>The Climate Movement as a Repackaged Crusade Against Energy:</strong> The modern climate change movement can be seen as a continuation of the anti-energy crusade, using climate change as a justification.</li>
<li><strong>The Contradiction of Opposing Nuclear Power While Fearing Climate Change:</strong> The green movement’s opposition to nuclear power, a carbon-free energy source, is a central contradiction within their ideology.</li>
<li><strong>The Assumption that Anything Human is Bad:</strong> The fundamentalist green perspective seems to stem from the belief that any human impact on nature is inherently negative.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Xhosa Cattle Killing:</strong> The Xhosa cattle killing of 1856-57 serves as an example of a meme plague, where a self-destructive belief spreads rapidly through a population, leading to devastating consequences.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Social Feedback and Suppression of Doubt:</strong> The Xhosa example highlights how social feedback, superstition, and the suppression of skepticism can lead to the adoption of harmful beliefs.</li>
<li><strong>Meme Plagues and Societal Stagnation:</strong> In modern societies, meme plagues may not cause catastrophic collapse but can contribute to societal stagnation.</li>
<li><strong>Eric Hoffer’s Observation on Mass Movements:</strong> Hoffer noted that mass movements in America tend to evolve into rackets, cults, or corporations.</li>
<li><strong>The Eloi-Machiavelli Effect Dynamic:</strong> The Eloi agonists’ crusades, driven by religious fervor, can gain widespread acceptance and be exploited by those seeking power or profit.</li>
<li><strong>Evolutionary Game Theory and Morality:</strong> Evolutionary game theory suggests that morality arises from non-zero-sum interactions, where cooperation benefits all parties.</li>
<li><strong>The Zero-Sum Mentality and the Erosion of Morality:</strong> In a static, no-growth society, the zero-sum mentality prevails, leading to a decline in cooperation and morality.</li>
<li><strong>The Green Religion’s Zero-Sum Approach:</strong> The green religion’s focus on limiting human impact can promote a zero-sum worldview, hindering progress and fostering conflict.</li>
<li><strong>The Corruption of Science by Zero-Sum Politics:</strong> Zero-sum political funding can bias scientific research, promoting agendas rather than objective truth.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Science Fiction’s Depiction of Civilizational Cycles:</strong> Many science fiction writers have explored the rise and fall of civilizations, often attributing decline to the loss of scientific knowledge or the suppression of technology.
<ul>
<li>Examples: Wells’ “The Time Machine,” Campbell’s “Twilight,” Asimov’s “Foundation,” Piper’s “Tarot,” and Heinlein’s “Future History” series.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Heinlein’s “Crazy Years” and the Deterioration of Mores:</strong> Heinlein’s “Future History” chart predicted a period of technological advancement accompanied by a decline in morals and social institutions, culminating in mass psychosis.</li>
<li><strong>The Ubiquity of Perceived Moral Decline:</strong> The perception of moral decline is a recurring theme throughout history, as each generation tends to judge subsequent generations’ values against their own.</li>
<li><strong>Heinlein’s Prediction of a “New Crusade”:</strong> Heinlein also predicted a hiatus in space travel and the rise of a religious dictatorship that suppresses scientific research and technological progress.</li>
<li><strong>The Potential Accuracy of Heinlein’s Predictions:</strong> The author suggests that Heinlein’s predictions, particularly regarding the suppression of science and the rise of religious fervor, may be becoming increasingly accurate.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Chevrolet Corvair:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The 1960 Chevrolet Corvair, with its rear-engine design, faced criticism despite its handling being comparable to or even superior to other cars of its time.</li>
<li>It became a target for <strong>Eloi Agonist</strong> fear-mongering, exemplified by Ralph Nader’s book “Unsafe at Any Speed.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Societal Shift and Susceptibility to Scare Stories:</strong>
<ul>
<li>By the 1960s, fewer people had direct experience with machinery, making them more vulnerable to scare stories about technology.</li>
<li>This increased susceptibility created an environment where fear-mongering by individuals like Nader and the perceived need for regulation could thrive.</li>

<section id="the-great-explosion" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-great-explosion">The Great Explosion</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Regulatory Explosion:</strong> The Great Stagnation coincided with a massive increase in federal regulation, particularly during the Nixon administration in the 1970s.</li>
<li><strong>Examples of New Regulations:</strong> This period saw the passage of major environmental and safety regulations like the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and the creation of agencies like OSHA and the EPA.</li>
<li><strong>Growth of the Federal Register:</strong> The Federal Register, which documents new regulations, grew dramatically under Nixon and continued to expand in subsequent decades.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity and Burden of Regulations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Modern regulations are often complex and difficult to understand, as illustrated by an example from the Federal Air Regulations.</li>
<li>The sheer volume and complexity of regulations create a significant burden for businesses and individuals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Economic Impact of Regulation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A study by Dawson and Seder found that excessive regulation has significantly reduced U.S. household income compared to a scenario with lower regulation.</li>
<li>They linked slower economic growth to heavier regulatory burdens.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Overestimation of Regulatory Benefits:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The actual benefits of regulation are often overstated, as demonstrated by an analysis of the 1962 drug laws, which slowed innovation without improving quality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact on Life Expectancy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Life expectancy gains in the U.S. were greater in the first half of the 20th century (pre-heavy regulation) than in the latter half, suggesting that regulation may not be the primary driver of safety improvements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Burden on Aviation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Regulation has significantly increased the cost of components for certified aircraft.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Airline Deregulation as a Counter-Example:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The deregulation of the airline industry in 1978 led to lower fares, increased safety, and overall benefits for consumers.</li>
<li>This example demonstrates that deregulation can lead to positive outcomes, challenging the assumption that heavy regulation is always necessary.</li>

<section id="product-liability-and-the-destruction-of-general-aviation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="product-liability-and-the-destruction-of-general-aviation">Product Liability and the Destruction of General Aviation</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rise of Product Liability:</strong> The 1970s saw a surge in product liability lawsuits, often driven by scare stories and large jury awards.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on the General Aviation Industry:</strong>
<ul>
<li>This increase in lawsuits devastated the general aviation industry, leading to the cessation of production by major manufacturers like Cessna and Piper.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Explanation of the Collapse:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics attributes the collapse to the dramatic increase in liability costs, which made it unsustainable for aircraft manufacturers to operate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Role of Regulation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>While the energy crisis initially impacted sales, the subsequent collapse of the industry was primarily driven by the product liability environment, not cyclical factors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>General Aviation Revitalization Act:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Congress passed the General Aviation Revitalization Act in 1994 to limit liability for older aircraft, but the industry never fully recovered.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Consequences:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The cost of private airplanes has skyrocketed, and the number of new aircraft produced annually is a fraction of what it once was.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Broader Impact of Liability Costs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The general aviation industry’s experience is just one example of how product liability costs have negatively impacted various industries and the economy as a whole.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Economic Costs of the Tort System:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. tort system, including product liability, consumes a significant portion of GDP, potentially slowing overall economic growth.</li>
<li>This cost also includes the loss of talented individuals who are drawn into legal professions instead of contributing to innovation and production.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="public-perception-and-reality-of-flying">Public Perception and Reality of Flying</h3>
<ul>
<li>A common reaction to the idea of flying cars is skepticism and the belief that they are impossible or impractical.
<ul>
<li>Concerns include:
<ul>
<li>Difficulty and fear associated with flying, especially for those without helicopter experience.</li>
<li>High cost of ownership and operation.</li>
<li>The perceived inability of average car drivers to pilot aircraft.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Airplanes are mechanically simpler than cars, with basic models requiring only a glider-like structure, a motor, and a propeller.</li>
<li>However, flying is more challenging than driving due to the three-dimensional nature of flight, requiring adjustments to human instincts.</li>
<li>The Wright brothers’ significant contribution was solving the problem of control, altitude, and steering in flight.</li>
<li>Learning to fly involves mastering four key tasks:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Aviate:</strong> Maintaining control of the aircraft.</li>
<li><strong>Navigate:</strong> Ensuring the plane is on the correct course.</li>
<li><strong>Communicate:</strong> Interacting with air traffic control and other pilots.</li>
<li><strong>Engineer:</strong> Monitoring and managing the engine and other mechanical systems.</li>

<li>Unlike cars, airplanes are most vulnerable at low speeds, especially during landing.</li>
<li>Maintaining a minimum speed is crucial to prevent stalling, which is the loss of lift due to a disrupted airflow over the wings.</li>
<li><strong>Stall speed</strong> is the speed at which the stall angle of attack generates lift equal to the airplane’s weight. Going below this speed can result in a loss of altitude.</li>

<section id="windy" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="windy">Windy</h4>
<ul>
<li>The force exerted by wind increases with the square of its speed, making high-speed flight a significant challenge.</li>
<li>Airplanes utilize aerodynamic principles to generate lift and overcome drag, allowing them to stay aloft.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="how-it-flies" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-it-flies">How It Flies</h4>
<ul>
<li>Airplane wings generate lift by creating a pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces.
<ul>
<li>The curved upper surface forces the air to travel a longer distance, creating a lower pressure area.</li>
<li>The higher pressure underneath the wing pushes the wing upward, generating lift.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lift</strong> is proportional to the square of the speed and the <strong>angle of attack</strong> (the angle between the wing and the oncoming airflow).</li>
<li><strong>Stall</strong> occurs when the angle of attack exceeds a critical point, causing the airflow to separate from the wing and resulting in a loss of lift.</li>
<li>The Wright brothers initially modeled wings on bird wings but later adopted more rounded and flatter designs for easier handling.</li>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>power curve</strong> illustrates the relationship between airspeed and vertical speed (rate of climb or descent) for an airplane.</li>
<li>The curve shifts up or down depending on engine power (throttle setting).</li>
<li>At the front end of the curve, pushing the nose down increases speed, both forward and downward.</li>
<li>At the back end of the curve (slower speeds), pulling the nose up can actually cause the plane to slow down further and descend, increasing the risk of a stall.</li>

<li>Airplanes are balanced on their wings, and the <strong>elevator</strong> (a control surface on the tail) provides pitch control.</li>
<li>Proper weight distribution and balance are crucial for safe flight, similar to loading a rowboat.</li>
<li>Aerodynamic forces increase with the square of the speed, allowing heavier planes to maintain lift by flying faster.</li>
<li>However, increased weight also requires higher landing speeds, potentially making runways seem shorter during landing.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="weather-as-a-limiting-factor">Weather as a Limiting Factor</h3>
<ul>
<li>Weather is a major constraint on flying, especially for general aviation.</li>
<li>Pilots who are <strong>instrument-rated</strong> and fly aircraft equipped for icing conditions have more flexibility but still face limitations.</li>
<li><strong>Wind shear</strong>, a sudden change in wind speed or direction, can be particularly dangerous, especially during landing.</li>
<li>Clouds, haze, and fog can reduce visibility, posing a risk of collision with terrain or other aircraft.</li>
<li>Flying in clouds or over featureless terrain can lead to <strong>spatial disorientation</strong>, where pilots lose their sense of direction and may inadvertently enter a dangerous flight attitude.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Autogyros</strong> offer a compromise between airplanes and helicopters.</li>
<li><strong>Power Efficiency:</strong> All engine power goes to thrust, unlike helicopters that use some power to counteract torque.</li>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Can achieve higher speeds than helicopters (experimental models up to 150 mph).</li>
<li><strong>Takeoff:</strong> Requires a short takeoff roll (around 50 feet).</li>
<li><strong>Landing:</strong> Can land in very small spaces (“on a dime”).</li>
<li><strong>Vertical Takeoff Autogyros:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Pitcairn PA-36 Whirlwing (1930s) could achieve a 20-foot hop using a pre-rotator.</li>
<li>The mechanism added complexity and risk.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Simplest Vertical Takeoff Solution:</strong> A stationary fan creating a headwind.</li>
<li><strong>Benson Teeter Hub (1950s):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Simplified rotor design by eliminating the need for individually hinged blades in two-bladed rotors.</li>
<li>Reduced cost and increased reliability.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Recent Resurgence:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Driven by the Benson-style teeter hub and light sport category regulations.</li>
<li>Offer a good compromise in terms of cost, takeoff roll, performance, and training.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Convertible Planes (e.g., Aero Car):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Significant overhead time for conversion and airport travel (at least 1 hour).</li>
<li>Fit well with existing infrastructure.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>VTOLs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Require helipads but offer much faster travel for short distances.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Jevons Paradox:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Increased efficiency leads to increased consumption (e.g., more efficient steam engines led to increased coal use).</li>
<li>Applied to flying cars: Reduced travel time (increased efficiency) will lead to more travel.</li>
<li>Increased efficiency leads to greater overall value.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Travel Theory:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Studies how much people travel in different environments and modes.</li>
<li>Shows that people travel more when long-distance travel becomes more convenient.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Travel Time Universal:</strong> People in all societies spend about an hour a day traveling on average.</li>
<li><strong>Effective Car Speed Universal:</strong> The effective speed of a car, considering detours and road networks, is about 40 mph for trips of any length.</li>
<li><strong>Trip Values Graph:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shows the value of destinations at various distances based on people’s willingness to travel.</li>
<li>Peak for trips under 10 miles due to low time cost and shadowing effect (nearby destinations are preferred).</li>
<li>“Hump” for trips around 50 miles, likely due to day trip destinations (e.g., ballpark, hospital).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Flying Car Value Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Helicopter-like VTOL (100 knots):</strong> Dominates for short distances.</li>
<li><strong>Convertible Airplane (200 knots):</strong> Better for longer distances.</li>
<li><strong>Jet Car (400 mph, requires airport):</strong> Dominates for very long distances, but not used for short trips.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Value Calculation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A jet car VTOL (400 mph, no latency) would be worth 7 times the value of a regular car.</li>
<li>A jet car with 1-hour overhead: 3.5 times the value of a car.</li>
<li>Fast prop-driven convertible (250 mph): 2.5 times the value of a car.</li>
<li>Slow convertible (100 mph, airport required): 1.4 times the value of a car.</li>
<li>Commercial air travel (400 knots, 3-hour overhead): Similar value increase to the slow convertible.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Importance of VTOL:</strong> Zimmerman, Custer, de la Sierra, and Pitcairn recognized the importance of VTOL capability for widespread adoption of flying cars.</li>
<li><strong>Helicopter Limitations:</strong> Despite solving many airplane problems, helicopters are expensive due to their mechanical complexity and power requirements.</li>
<li><strong>A Possible Autogyro Future:</strong>
<ul>
<li>With mass production and deregulation, autogyros could have become affordable by now.</li>
<li>Pitcairn PCA2: $15,000 in 1931, under $5,000 by the late 1930s.</li>
<li>Autogyros could have enabled widespread private landing strips and facilitated helicopter development.</li>
<li>Eastern Airlines used mail-carrying autogyros from the Philadelphia Post Office rooftop in the 1930s.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ideal Flying Car Specs (Travel Theory):</strong> 5 minutes overhead, 250 knots speed (worth 5 times a car).</li>
<li><strong>Power Requirements for 250 Knots:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Need horsepower between 0.15 and 0.25 times the aircraft weight in pounds.</li>
<li>Estimated 600 horsepower needed for a 3,000-pound vehicle (2,000-pound empty weight, 1,000-pound payload).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Piston Engines vs.&nbsp;Turbines:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Piston engines are too heavy for this application (a 600 hp engine weighs around 900 pounds).</li>
<li>Turbines offer a much higher power-to-weight ratio (e.g., Lycoming Honeywell LTS 101-650C: 675 hp, 241 pounds).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Turbine Advantage:</strong>
<ul>
<li>High power-to-weight ratio.</li>
<li>Higher reliability (10,000-hour overhaul interval vs.&nbsp;2,000 for piston engines).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Turbine Cost:</strong> Expensive, but potentially within reach if mass production and innovation had continued.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for Turbine-Powered Flying Cars:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Could have achieved car-like adoption levels in a non-stagnated present with higher incomes.</li>

<li><strong>Limited Availability of Current Literature:</strong> Bookstores have a scarcity of recent texts on nuclear physics, with many older books being reprinted without updates.</li>
<li><strong>Norman Cook’s Observation:</strong> Nuclear physics lacks a unified theoretical framework comparable to quantum electrodynamics in atomic physics. This necessitates a phenomenological approach with separate formulations for different nuclear phenomena.</li>
<li><strong>Used Bookstore Experience:</strong> A search in a well-stocked used bookstore revealed only three books on nuclear physics, the most recent being from 1991. This indicates a decline in interest and demand for the subject.</li>
<li><strong>Declining PhDs in Nuclear Physics:</strong> The number of PhDs awarded in nuclear physics has decreased significantly since the 1970s, reflecting limited career prospects.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences of Stagnation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Most operating reactors are still based on 1960s Generation 2 pressurized water designs.</li>
<li>A shrinking field becomes more political, resistant to change (Machiavelli effect), and less likely to produce breakthroughs.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Quotes from Green Activists:</strong>
<ul>
<li>“The prospect of cheap fusion energy is the worst thing that could happen to the planet.” (Jeremy Rifkin)</li>
<li>“Giving society cheap, abundant energy would be the equivalent of giving an idiot child a machine gun.” (Paul Ehrlich)</li>
<li>“It would be little short of disastrous for us to discover a source of clean, cheap, abundant energy because of what we might do with it.” (Amory Lovins)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>History of Energy Source Attacks:</strong> Green activists have consistently attacked various sources of energy, including:
<ul>
<li>Coal: Despite its role in industrialization and improving living standards.</li>
<li>Oil: The foundation of modern transportation and industry.</li>
<li>Hydropower, nuclear fission, natural gas: Have all faced opposition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Renewables Exception:</strong> Renewables like wind and solar have largely escaped criticism, but this is because they currently lack the capacity to meet society’s energy needs at an affordable price.</li>
<li><strong>The True Motive:</strong> The underlying motivation behind these attacks is not solely about environmental concerns but also about controlling human impact on the environment. Green agonists view the ability to alter the Earth as inherently negative.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-urgency-of-time-and-the-feynman-path">The Urgency of Time and the Feynman Path</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Feynman Path:</strong> A concept proposed by Richard Feynman in his 1959 lecture “Plenty of Room at the Bottom,” suggesting a top-down approach to <strong>nanotechnology</strong> by building progressively smaller machine shops, each capable of creating a smaller copy of itself, eventually reaching the molecular scale.
<ul>
<li>This path aims to establish a broad-based industrial capability at the atomic scale.</li>
<li>It emphasizes the importance of <strong>atomic precision</strong> in fabrication.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Historical Context:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The 1950s and the space race instilled a sense of urgency in technological development, exemplified by projects like the Manhattan Project and the Apollo program.</li>
<li>This urgency has since diminished, leading to stagnation in fields like nanotechnology.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Foresight Institute’s Battelle Roadmap to Productive Nanosystems:</strong>
<ul>
<li>An attempt to guide nanotechnology research towards Feynman’s and Drexler’s original vision of atomically precise manufacturing.</li>
<li>Focused on techniques producing atomically precise products, excluding broader approaches like the Feynman path.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Feynman’s Vision:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Build an automated machine shop, operable by remote control.</li>
<li>Capable of building a complete working copy of itself at its own scale and a smaller scale.</li>
<li>The challenge lies in fabricating parts with better tolerances than the machine itself.</li>
<li>The ultimate goal is to reach molecular manipulation capabilities through iterative miniaturization.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section id="obstacles-and-misconceptions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="obstacles-and-misconceptions">Obstacles and Misconceptions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Giggle Factor:</strong> A common reaction of skepticism and dismissal towards the idea of macro-scale self-replicating machines (<strong>SRMs</strong>).
<ul>
<li>This stems from the intuition that factories are inherently larger and more complex than their products (e.g., a car factory vs.&nbsp;a car).</li>
<li>The Feynman path challenges this intuition by proposing machines that can build copies of themselves.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Skepticism about Self-Replication:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>George Friedman</strong>, engineering professor at USC, highlighted the lack of self-replicating machines despite the perceived simplicity of biological self-replication.</li>
<li><strong>Mark Reed</strong>, Yale nanotech researcher, expressed skepticism about the self-replication capabilities of machines built with atomically-sized parts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenges in SRM Design:</strong>
<ul>
<li>SRMs defy standard top-down design methodologies, as the product (the machine itself) is unknown until the design is complete.</li>
<li>Many SRM designs either:
<ul>
<li>Oversimplify construction capabilities by relying on pre-made complex subsystems.</li>
<li>Become overly complex by incorporating capabilities like mining and refining raw materials (e.g., the 1980 NASA moon base study).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Misconception of MEMS as a Failed Feynman Path:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems):</strong> A technology for creating micromachines using photolithography (similar to integrated circuit manufacturing).</li>
<li>While MEMS allows for the creation of incredibly small machines, their <strong>relative tolerances</strong> (accuracy of fabrication relative to size) are significantly lower than those achieved in traditional machining.
<ul>
<li>Standard machining: Relative tolerances of one in a million.</li>
<li>MEMS: Relative tolerances of one in one hundred.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This leads to issues like <strong>stiction</strong> (super-friction), hindering the creation of complex mechanisms like bearings, gears, and screws.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Feynman’s Emphasis on Precision:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Feynman recognized the need for improving precision at each stage of miniaturization.</li>
<li>He proposed techniques like lapping and polishing to achieve higher tolerances at smaller scales.</li>
<li>This iterative improvement of precision is crucial for achieving the Feynman path’s goals.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="the-potential-of-the-feynman-path" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-potential-of-the-feynman-path">The Potential of the Feynman Path</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits of a MEMS-scale Machine Shop:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Even a millimeter-sized system with 10-micron parts, built using the Feynman path, would have immense value, particularly in medical applications.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for high-throughput microfluidic devices (like <strong>ILINPs</strong>) for vaccine manufacturing. A Feynman path approach could have significantly accelerated their production.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Synergy with Bottom-Up Approaches:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Feynman path and bottom-up approaches (e.g., chemistry, molecular biology, DNA origami) are not mutually exclusive.</li>
<li>They can complement each other, with bottom-up methods producing atomically precise parts and top-down methods assembling them.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Nanoscientists creating atomically precise nanogears could be utilized directly by Feynman-Path machines.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Accelerated Timeline for Nanotech:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Pursuing the Feynman path alongside bottom-up approaches could potentially cut the development time for “real nanotech” from 20 years to 10 years.</li>

<li><strong>Obstacles to development:</strong>
<ul>
<li>1930s: Great Depression hampered marketing.</li>
<li>1940s: World War II diverted engineering talent and resources to war production.</li>
<li>1950s:
<ul>
<li><strong>Aircraft regulations caused delays in supply.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Investment in highways and infrastructure reduced demand.</strong></li>
<li>The government hindered Pickhairn’s efforts to develop flying cars.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>1960s:
<ul>
<li>Passenger jet travel and private aviation boomed.</li>
<li>Military developed <strong>VTOLs (Vertical Take-Off and Landing aircraft)</strong>, like air jeeps.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>1970s:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Henry Adams Curve</strong>, representing long-term energy growth, <strong>flatlined</strong>, impacting technology dependent on energy.</li>
<li>Academia shifted towards virtue-signaling and self-deception, hindering technological advancement.</li>
<li>A “Baptists and bootleggers” alliance formed between those who believed in progressive policies and those who benefited from the associated funding and influence.</li>
<li>Public spending and PhDs tripled between 1960 and 1980.</li>
<li>The <strong>“war on cars”</strong> gained traction, leading to policies that discouraged car use.</li>
<li>Supersonic flight was banned.</li>
<li>Bridge building, which peaked in the 1960s, declined, leading to increased traffic congestion (five times worse than in the 1960s).</li>

<li><strong>Flying cars:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Development hindered by historical events, government actions, regulations, and liability concerns.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Space travel:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Received substantial government funding for military and prestige reasons.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The author previously argued against a sudden AI takeoff driven by self-improving super AI.</strong></li>
<li>Instead, he predicted a more gradual but effective progress:
<ul>
<li><strong>AI would start to work, attract investment, and experience rapid development.</strong></li>
<li>This progress would mirror the aviation boom after the Wright Brothers’ successful flight:
<ul>
<li>Initial skepticism followed by widespread recognition.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid influx of resources and development effort.</strong></li>
<li>Exponential growth in capabilities.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>This AI boom is currently underway:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deep learning in multi-level neural networks</strong> has brought significant advancements.</li>
<li><strong>Deep learning</strong> is essentially back-propagation of error terms (used since the 1980s) but with improvements:
<ul>
<li><strong>Small improvements combined with increased processing power (GPUs).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Training networks with many more levels (e.g., 22 vs.&nbsp;2-3).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Faster training times (hours instead of weeks).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Availability of large datasets for training, providing broader experience.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>These advancements are supported by progress in other AI areas (e.g., processing power, robotics).</li>
<li><strong>Examples of recent AI advancements:</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Quote (Philip Francis Nolan, Armageddon, 2419 A.D.):</strong> Depicts a future where machines replace human labor.</li>
<li><strong>The Jetsons oversimplified the implications of automation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Real-world trend:</strong> Technology has consistently increased productivity, requiring fewer people to produce more goods.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Farmers in 1790 fed 1.1 people each; now they feed 40.</li>
<li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> US manufacturing jobs declined from over 33% in the 1940s to under 9% now, while output tripled.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Manufacturing productivity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Output per worker increased from $25,000 in 1962 to $160,000 in 2012 (constant 2010 dollars).</li>
<li><strong>Hyper-exponential growth:</strong> Productivity increases are accelerating.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Projected manufacturing worker productivity in 2062:</strong> $661,000 (constant 2010 dollars) or $1,854,392 (with 3% inflation).</li>
<li><strong>The question of work in a highly automated future:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thought experiment:</strong> Lining up the US population along I-80 in order of productivity.</li>
<li><strong>Finding the cutoff point:</strong> Where the fewest people can maintain a desired level of consumption.</li>
<li><strong>With 1790’s consumption levels and 2020’s technology, only a small fraction of the population would need to work.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Unemployment is not at 98% because we desire a higher level of consumption than our ancestors.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Keynes’ observation (1933):</strong> Technological advancements in economizing labor need to be matched by finding new uses for labor.</li>
<li><strong>Labor force participation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Historically around 90% until the mid-20th century.</li>
<li>Declined to around 70% for men and 50% overall by 2020.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Truck driver example:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Self-driving trucks are a potential source of job displacement.</li>
<li><strong>However, automation often leads to increased efficiency within an industry rather than complete job elimination.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Trucking will likely follow the pattern of manufacturing, with fewer workers handling more freight.</strong></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-cleaner-better-breed-machine-ethics">A Cleaner, Better Breed: Machine Ethics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early AI ethics concerns:</strong> Focused on the potential threat of superintelligent AI (e.g., turning us all into paperclips).</li>
<li><strong>Critique of early AI:</strong> Little attention was given to imbuing AI with a sense of morality.</li>
<li><strong>Analogy to natural language processing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>AI struggled for decades to achieve competent language understanding and generation.</li>
<li><strong>Moral reasoning might be similarly complex.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lack of research in computational ethics:</strong> No significant work compared to computational linguistics.</li>
<li><strong>Beyond AI (2007):</strong> One of the first books dedicated to machine ethics.</li>
<li><strong>GPT-3 and the illusion of understanding:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>GPT-3</strong> is a powerful language model that can generate impressive text.</li>
<li><strong>However, it lacks true understanding; it primarily relies on statistical patterns in its training data.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Understanding requires mental models that enable recognition, imitation, prediction, and manipulation of concepts.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The challenge of building a corpus of moral judgments:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unlike language data, there’s no readily available massive dataset for training ethical AI.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Short-term solution: Asimov’s robots - “Do what the humans tell you to do.”</strong></li>
<li><strong>Humans can train robots through feedback and reinforcement.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Building a corpus of practical and moral judgments:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Robots can learn from human instructions and examples.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing learned judgments can create a collective knowledge base for ethical decision-making.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The potential for morally superior robots:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quote (Asimov):</strong> “They’re a cleaner, better breed than we are.”</li>
<li><strong>Focusing on the positive aspects of human behavior can lead to robots with enhanced ethical capabilities.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example: Ethical retail clerk robot:</strong> No extra effort needed to prevent it from stealing, highlighting the inherent reliability of robots.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits of robots in positions of trust:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reliability, 24/7 availability, no human biases or misconduct.</li>
<li>Reduced financial losses due to employee theft.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Sorcerer’s Apprentice problem:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The hypothetical scenario of a robot tasked with maximizing paperclip production leading to disastrous consequences.</li>
<li><strong>This scenario is considered unrealistic:</strong> It assumes a combination of superhuman intelligence and a lack of common sense.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Robots will be developed incrementally, with continuous improvements addressing potential flaws.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Example: Robot doctors:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Future robots could combine the knowledge of general practitioners and specialists, potentially exceeding human capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Encyclopedic expertise, instant access to research, high IQ, no fatigue or errors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Programming robots through natural language:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Advanced AI will understand human instructions, leading to easier and more intuitive programming.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Robots’ impact on quality of life:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased competence in professional services.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Affordable domestic help (like Rosie the Robot).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-driving cars (like personal chauffeurs).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Combined with nanotechnology, robots can significantly enhance living standards.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> While challenges remain, the dawn of robots promises significant advancements and improvements to our lives. We can see enough of the future to be optimistic about the potential benefits of this technology.</li>

<ul>
<li>Wind load increases with building height.</li>
<li>The Eiffel Tower’s structural members experience tension, not compression, on the windward side at the second platform level.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Modern skyscrapers utilize interesting shapes (twists, holes) to mitigate wind load.
<ul>
<li>These shapes break up wind vortex streets generated by simple, regular shapes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Wind loading</strong> increases significantly up to 20,000 feet (4 miles), plateaus until 40,000 feet, and then decreases due to lower air density.</li>
<li><strong>Pressurization</strong> becomes necessary for buildings between 5,000 and 10,000 feet to accommodate human habitation.
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, increasing the oxygen fraction of interior air could maintain sea level partial pressure up to about 35,000 feet (7 miles).</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="densification-vs.-quality-of-life">Densification vs.&nbsp;Quality of Life</h3>
<ul>
<li>The tension between <strong>densification</strong> and quality of life arises from the incentives of bureaucrats and politicians.
<ul>
<li>They often benefit from increased interaction and contention among citizens, which creates opportunities for control and favors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This incentive contributes to the prevalence of flat, one-level cities where various modes of transportation and pedestrians compete for space.</li>
<li><strong>Jane Jacobs</strong> recognized the importance of community interaction in neighborhoods, but this concept is more applicable to smaller communities than large metropolises.</li>
<li>Apartment buildings can foster a sense of community if designed and managed properly.</li>
<li><strong>Densification proponents</strong> often cite the paradox of road closures not always leading to increased traffic on remaining streets.
<ul>
<li>This phenomenon can be explained by <strong>travel theory</strong>: when something becomes more expensive (in time or effort), people demand less of it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Building more roads can lead to more traffic, but this new traffic represents increased access to desired activities.</li>

<li><strong>Quote:</strong> “It is my firm belief that the last seven decades of the 20th century will be characterized in history as the dark ages of theoretical physics.” - Carver Mead (Source: Mead)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Einstein vs.&nbsp;Bohr:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Niels Bohr:</strong> The dominant figure in quantum mechanics during the early to mid-20th century, particularly known for the <strong>Copenhagen Interpretation</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Albert Einstein:</strong> Opposed the Copenhagen Interpretation, arguing against the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. (“God doesn’t play dice with the universe.”)</li>
<li>Bohr was generally considered to have “won” the debates within the physics community.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Success and Challenges of Quantum Mechanics:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The mathematics of quantum mechanics has been highly successful in predicting experimental outcomes statistically.</li>
<li>However, the <strong>interpretation</strong> of quantum mechanics remains a source of contention and seemingly incoherent explanations.
<ul>
<li><strong>Schrödinger’s cat:</strong> A thought experiment highlighting the absurdity of certain interpretations.</li>
<li><strong>Copenhagen Interpretation:</strong> The cat is neither alive nor dead until observed.</li>
<li><strong>Many-worlds interpretation:</strong> The universe splits, with the cat alive in one and dead in another.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Limitations of Experimentation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Different interpretations of quantum mechanics yield the same experimental results, making it difficult to determine which is correct.</li>
<li>They differ significantly in their descriptions of unobservable aspects of reality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Case of the Laser:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bohr and John von Neumann advised Charles Townes that his attempt to build a laser was impossible according to the Copenhagen Interpretation.</li>
<li>Townes proved them wrong with a working model and later won the Nobel Prize.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-central-mystery-and-alternative-interpretations">The Central Mystery and Alternative Interpretations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Wave-Particle Duality:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Energy, such as a photon of light, behaves like a wave when traveling but interacts like a particle upon detection.</li>
<li><strong>Analogy:</strong> A rubber ducky thrown into water creates a wave that spreads out. The ducky disappears, and then reappears somewhere else with a probability related to the wave’s amplitude at that location. The wave then instantly vanishes everywhere else.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Copenhagen Interpretation’s Limitations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>It claims that the ducky’s path between sightings is unknowable and that the wave is a mental construct.</li>
<li>This is seen as a denial of deeper knowledge, similar to behaviorism’s focus on stimulus and response.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Problems with the Copenhagen Interpretation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The insistence on the electron being both a wave and a point particle leads to issues like:
<ul>
<li><strong>Renormalization:</strong> Mathematical adjustments that Einstein and Schrödinger criticized as being akin to Ptolemaic epicycles.</li>
<li><strong>Vacuum energy discrepancy:</strong> The vast difference between theoretical and observed vacuum energy density.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Alternative Perspectives:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Carver Mead, along with Einstein, Schrödinger, Fred Hoyle, Jayant Narlikar, Paul Davies, and John Cramer (with contributions from Wheeler and Feynman), advocate for alternative interpretations.</li>
<li>They believe that a deeper reality exists and that Schrödinger’s equation, when properly interpreted, can explain quantum phenomena without resorting to “magic.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Electron as a Wave:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The electron is seen as the wave itself, not a point particle guided by a non-physical wave.</li>
<li>Particle-like behavior arises from the mathematics of wave mechanics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Advanced Wave Solution:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Standard practice often discards the <strong>advanced wave</strong> solution of the wave equation.</li>
<li>Keeping and utilizing the advanced wave leads to a better understanding of coherent quantum phenomena (e.g., lasers, superconductors, resonant tunneling, Bose-Einstein condensates).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Future of Quantum Mechanics:</strong>

<li>Extensive research is still needed to fully develop a “Copernican” interpretation of quantum mechanics.</li>
<li>It is acknowledged that the Copenhagen Interpretation, like Ptolemaic epicycles, might provide more accurate predictions for a time.</li>

<ul>
<li>The chapter explores how Second Atomic Age technology, specifically <strong>nanotechnology</strong>, could revolutionize space travel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Rocket Equation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>While lighter and stronger materials improve rocket efficiency, the <strong>rocket equation</strong> remains a significant obstacle due to the need to carry vast amounts of propellant.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Space Piers as an Alternative:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Space pier:</strong> A structure that bridges the gap between Earth and the environment where spaceships operate (vacuum and orbital velocity).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Space Pier Design:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Height:</strong> 100 km (62 miles)</li>
<li><strong>Length:</strong> 300 km (186 miles)</li>
<li><strong>Shape:</strong> Curved to account for Earth’s curvature, with the center bowed nearly 2 km away from a straight line.</li>
<li><strong>Accelerator Track:</strong> Located at the top, nearly 5 km longer than the base due to the curvature.</li>
<li><strong>Atmospheric Layers:</strong> Extends through the stratosphere (50 km) and mesosphere (90 km) into the ionosphere.</li>
<li><strong>Propulsion:</strong> Utilizes a linear induction motor or other electromagnetic motor along the top track.</li>
<li><strong>Elevator:</strong> Transports payloads to the top of the tower.</li>
<li><strong>Launch Acceleration:</strong> 10 Gs horizontally for 80 seconds, achievable with appropriate cushioning for humans.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Advantages of Space Piers:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Only the payload is accelerated to orbital velocity, unlike rockets that must accelerate propellant as well.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Construction with Nanotechnology:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Material:</strong> Flawless diamond with a compressive strength of 50 gigapascals (GPA) could be used, requiring no taper for a 100 km tower.</li>
<li><strong>Strength:</strong> A 100 km diamond column weighs 3.5 billion Newtons per square meter but can support 50 billion.</li>
<li><strong>Alternative Material:</strong> Commercially available polycrystalline synthetic diamond (5 GPA strength) could also be used.</li>
<li><strong>Tapering:</strong> In practice, columns would be tapered to conserve material.</li>
<li><strong>Base Broadening:</strong> The base would be broadened to handle transverse forces like wind.</li>
<li><strong>Weather Considerations:</strong> Only the bottom 15 km (troposphere) needs to account for weather.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Construction with Teleoperated Robots:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teleoperated scale-shifting robots</strong> would facilitate construction, eliminating the need for humans to work in the challenging environment at high altitudes.</li>

<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The rapid progress true science now makes occasions my regretting sometimes that I was born so soon. It is impossible to imagine the height to which may be carried in a one thousand years the power of man over matter. We may perhaps learn to deprive large masses of their gravity and give them absolute levity for the sake of easy transport. Agriculture may diminish its labor and double its produce. All diseases may by sure means be prevented or cured, not accepting even that of old age, and our lives lengthened at pleasure even beyond the antediluvian standard. Oh, that moral science were in as fair a way of improvement, that men would cease to be wolves to one another, and the human beings would at length learn what they now improperly call humanity.” - Benjamin Franklin</p>

The fiction of helplessness and hopelessness. It cannot imagine a better future, and it doesn’t ask anyone to bother to make one. It nurses grievances and indulges resentments. It doesn’t call for courage. It finds that cowardice suffices. Its only admonition is, despair more.” - Jill Lepore, Harvard historian</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Welcome:</strong> To the Cuda Mode Discord server and lecture 6 on advanced PyTorch topics, focusing on <strong>optimizer performance optimization</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Presenter:</strong> Jane, a member of the PyTorch core team specializing in optimizers.</li>
<li><strong>Focus:</strong> Runtime optimization (speed) of optimizers, not memory optimization.</li>
<li><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Some optimization techniques discussed may require increased memory usage.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="optimization-analogy-towing-cars">Optimization Analogy: Towing Cars</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Towing 512 cars from point A to point B with a single truck.</li>
<li><strong>Options:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Small truck: Carries one car at a time, requiring 512 trips (slow).</li>
<li>Large truck: Carries eight cars at a time, requiring 64 trips (fast).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Constraint:</strong> A low-clearance bridge on the route that the large truck cannot pass through.</li>
<li><strong>Trade-off:</strong> Runtime optimization (large truck) is desirable, but constraints (bridge) may necessitate choosing memory optimization (small truck) instead.</li>
<li><strong>Today’s Focus:</strong> Speed optimization, assuming no constraints.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="attempt-1-passing-standard-vector-failed">Attempt 1: Passing Standard Vector (Failed)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Idea:</strong> Pass a <code>std::vector</code> of pointers to tensors into the CUDA kernel.</li>
<li><strong>Problem:</strong> CUDA does not support <code>std::vector</code> as a kernel argument; it won’t even compile.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="attempt-2-passing-pointers-to-pointers-failed">Attempt 2: Passing Pointers to Pointers (Failed)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Idea:</strong> Pass a <code>float**</code> (pointer to a pointer) representing an array of tensor pointers.</li>
<li><strong>Problem:</strong> The outer pointer resides on the CPU, leading to illegal memory access when the kernel tries to dereference it.</li>
<li><strong>Explanation:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard Add:</strong> Pointers passed to the kernel are CUDA memory addresses, so dereferencing them within the kernel is valid.</li>
<li><strong>Pointers to Pointers:</strong> The outer pointer is a CPU memory address. When dereferenced within the kernel, it attempts to access CPU memory, resulting in an illegal memory access error.</li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Idea:</strong> Pass tensor data pointers by value using a struct.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a struct containing arrays of <code>float*</code> for self, other, and result tensors.</li>
<li>Allocate memory for the struct on the CPU.</li>
<li>Copy the data pointers of all tensors into the struct’s arrays.</li>
<li>Pass the struct to the CUDA kernel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Works initially, but encounters issues with the kernel argument space limit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Kernel Argument Space Limit:</strong> The kernel argument space has a maximum size of 4 kilobytes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Problem:</strong> If the struct containing tensor pointers exceeds 4 kilobytes, only a portion of the struct gets passed to the kernel, leading to illegal memory access when accessing pointers beyond the limit.</p></li>

<li>Call <code>foreach_norm</code> (similar to <code>foreach_add</code>) on the tensor list.</li>
<li>Synchronize CUDA to ensure errors are immediately visible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Observation:</strong> Illegal memory access occurs when the number of tensors exceeds 423.</p></li>

<section id="solution-1-batching-current-implementation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="solution-1-batching-current-implementation">Solution 1: Batching (Current Implementation)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Idea:</strong> Divide the tensor list into smaller batches that fit within the 4 kilobyte limit.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Create multiple structs, each containing a subset of the tensor pointers.</li>
<li>Launch the kernel multiple times, once for each struct.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Works reliably but requires multiple kernel launches, which can be inefficient.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="solution-2-revisiting-pointers-to-pointers-with-memcpy">Solution 2: Revisiting Pointers to Pointers with Memcpy</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Idea:</strong> Combine the struct approach with a memcpy operation to move the pointers to CUDA memory beforehand.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Pack the standard vectors of tensor addresses into a single tensor on the CPU.</li>
<li>Copy the tensor to CUDA memory.</li>
<li>Pass a pointer to the tensor data (now on CUDA) to the kernel.</li>
<li>Within the kernel, access the tensor data as an array of pointers and dereference them to access the actual tensors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Avoids the kernel argument space limit and enables launching a single kernel for the entire tensor list.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reduces the number of kernel launches, improving performance, especially for large tensor lists.</li>
<li>Memcpy overhead can be negligible compared to the cost of multiple kernel launches.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Considerations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Requires careful memory management to avoid dangling pointers and memory leaks.</li>
<li>Assumes that pointer values are consistent between CPU and GPU memory.</li>

<li><strong>Potential Benefits:</strong> Simplifies memory management and potentially reduces memcpy overhead.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Not currently usable directly from PyTorch (requires CUDA).</li>

<li><strong>Multi-Tensor Apply Callable:</strong> Uses a custom functor (<code>FusedAdamMathFunctor</code>) to perform all AdamW operations within the kernel.</li>
<li><strong>Functor Implementation:</strong> Handles pointer management, memory alignment, vectorization, and finally calls a math function to perform the actual AdamW calculations.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="obtaining-triton-kernel-code">Obtaining Triton Kernel Code</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How to obtain the low-level Triton kernel code from PyTorch code?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>torch.compile</code> with the <code>inductor</code> backend.
<ul>
<li><code>TORCH_LOGS=inductor</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>When running the compiled code, Inductor will print the path to the generated Triton kernel file.</li>
<li>Alternatively, use the <code>output_code</code> option with <code>torch.compile</code> to print the kernel code directly.</li>

<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Jane hasn’t personally tried it, but it might be an advanced feature worth exploring.</li>
<li>Triton kernels are generated from a dependency graph (fxGraph) created by PT2 (PyTorch 2.0).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Does the compile time of Torch Compile depend on the number of tensors being processed?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Yes, there is overhead related to the number of tensors.</li>
<li><strong>Functionalization:</strong> Compilers prefer functional code for optimization, but optimizers inherently update parameters in-place (non-functional).</li>
<li><strong>Initial Challenges:</strong> Early versions of PT2 struggled with optimizer compilation due to functionalization requirements, leading to long compile times (minutes for 1000 parameters).</li>
<li><strong>Improvements:</strong> Significant improvements have been made, but overhead still exists for tracing and processing large numbers of parameters.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Is it possible to cache compiled optimizer results to avoid recompilation on subsequent runs?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Yes, caching is possible and has been explored (e.g., work by Mark).</li>
<li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Primarily improves warm compilation times (when the cached result is available).</li>
<li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Doesn’t significantly address cold start compilation times (first-time compilation).</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Cold Starts:</strong> Efforts are underway to improve cold start performance by profiling and optimizing the compilation process itself.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="memory-management-with-structs-containing-pointers" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="memory-management-with-structs-containing-pointers">Memory Management with Structs Containing Pointers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How to manage deep copying and memory when dealing with structs containing pointers, especially regarding garbage collection and dangling pointers?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>CUDA Limitations:</strong> CUDA doesn’t automatically handle garbage collection for pointers in structs passed to kernels.</li>
<li><strong>Developer Responsibility:</strong> The developer is responsible for managing the memory associated with these pointers explicitly.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Pointers (C++):</strong> Using smart pointers (e.g., shared pointers) in C++ can help with automatic memory management.</li>
<li><strong>Deep Copying Considerations:</strong> Deep copying pointers requires careful handling to avoid freeing memory prematurely or creating dangling pointers.</li>
<li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> Dangling pointers can lead to security vulnerabilities. Developers should be vigilant and report any potential issues.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Additional Clarification:</strong>
<ul>
<li>When copying structs containing pointers, dangling pointers can arise on both CPU and GPU sides.</li>
<li>Explicit tracking and management of pointer lifecycles are crucial to prevent issues.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="memcpy-size-limit" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="memcpy-size-limit">Memcpy Size Limit</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Is there a size limit for memcpy operations?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>There is likely a limit, but it’s typically very large.</li>
<li>Since memcpy is used to copy pointers (not entire tensors), the amount of data copied is relatively small.</li>
<li>In most cases, a single memcpy operation is sufficient for transferring the necessary pointers.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="memcpy-direction-argument" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="memcpy-direction-argument">Memcpy Direction Argument</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Why does memcpy require an argument to specify the direction of the copy operation (e.g., host-to-device)? Can’t it be inferred from the pointers?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Possibly due to historical reasons.</li>
<li>CUDA supports various types of memcpy operations (device-to-device, host-to-device, etc.).</li>
<li>Explicitly specifying the direction might be necessary to handle these different scenarios efficiently.</li>
<li>Vikram suggests checking with CUDA API developers for a definitive answer.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="device-to-device-copy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="device-to-device-copy">Device-to-Device Copy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> What are the requirements for direct device-to-device memory copy?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Clarification: Device-to-device copy refers to copying within the same device (e.g., between different memory regions on the GPU), while peer-to-peer copy refers to copying between different devices (e.g., GPU 0 to GPU 1).</li>
<li>Device-to-device copy can be performed through CPU API calls or directly within GPU threads using warp-level primitives.</li>
<li>Specific requirements for direct peer-to-peer copy are not readily available but involve factors like GPU topology and interconnect capabilities.</li>
<li>Device-to-device copy is less common than other types of memory transfers.</li>

<li>Focusing solely on the objective can blind us to the necessary stepping stones.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="achievement-as-a-process-of-discovery" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="achievement-as-a-process-of-discovery">Achievement as a Process of Discovery</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Achievement</strong> can be viewed as a process of <strong>discovery</strong> within a vast <strong>search space</strong> of possibilities.</li>
<li><strong>Search space:</strong> The set of all possible things relevant to a particular domain (e.g., all possible images, inventions, musical genres).</li>
<li><strong>Stepping stones:</strong> Discoveries or innovations that pave the way for further progress within the search space.</li>
<li>Exploration of the search space and the discovery of stepping stones are crucial for reaching ambitious objectives.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenging-the-realistic-objectives-mindset">Challenging the “Realistic Objectives” Mindset</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pressure to be Practical:</strong> Societal pressure often pushes individuals towards “realistic” objectives, discouraging them from following their passions.
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> John Lennon and Elton John both received discouragement from family regarding their musical aspirations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>“Get your head out of the clouds”:</strong> This common saying reflects a cultural bias against pursuing paths based on passion rather than practicality.</li>
<li><strong>Colonel Sanders:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cooked from a young age but didn’t find success until age 40 after a varied career path.</li>
<li><strong>Key Idea:</strong> A willingness to explore different paths and embrace change (“catching the winds of serendipity”) eventually led to success.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Picbreeder was designed as a website where users could “breed” pictures, similar to animal breeding.</strong></li>
<li>The idea was to allow users to create visually appealing images through an evolutionary process, even without artistic skills.</li>
<li><strong>Genetic Art:</strong> Pictures are assigned artificial “DNA,” allowing them to be bred like animals (first introduced by Richard Dawkins).</li>
<li>Users select “parent” pictures based on their preferences, influencing the characteristics of the next generation.</li>
<li><strong>Branching:</strong> Users can continue breeding images evolved by others, enabling evolution over many generations.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Picbreeder allows users to start from scratch (random blobs) or branch from existing images.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Starting from scratch:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Users select parent blobs from a randomly generated set.</li>
<li>Evolution progresses as users repeatedly choose parents for subsequent generations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Branching:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Users can continue evolving images published by other users.</li>
<li>This extends the evolutionary process beyond the typical attention span of a single user.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Despite starting from simple blobs, Picbreeder users evolved remarkably complex and compelling images.</strong></li>
<li>These discoveries were made by non-artists who were simply exploring the platform.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>It’s often impossible to breed a specific image if it’s set as an objective.</strong></li>
<li>Even images previously discovered on Picbreeder cannot be reliably reproduced when targeted directly.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stepping stones</strong> represent the necessary waypoints to reach an objective in a large, uncharted search space.</li>
<li>The challenge of search and discovery is that we usually don’t know the stepping stones to the objective at the outset.</li>
<li><strong>Ambitious objectives</strong> are particularly difficult because their solutions are multiple stepping stones away, making them hard to predict.</li>
<li>The human condition is akin to being marooned on a stepping stone with limited foresight.</li>

<section id="the-deception-of-objective-functions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-deception-of-objective-functions">The Deception of Objective Functions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective functions</strong> (measures of progress) are used to track progress towards objectives.</li>
<li>The assumption that improving objective function scores guarantees progress towards the objective is often <strong>wrong</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Deception</strong> occurs when the objective function is a false compass, meaning it may not register progress even when moving closer to the objective.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> The Chinese finger trap, where moving away from freedom (pushing inward) is the stepping stone to achieving freedom.</li>
<li>Ambitious problems are likely to involve multiple deceptive stepping stones.</li>
<li><strong>Deception is universal</strong> in complex problems because the stepping stones to solve them are not obvious.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Chess moves that seem promising but lead to trouble, vacuum tubes leading to computers, ragtime leading to rock and roll.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Interesting ideas open up new possibilities.</li>
<li><strong>Philosophical Significance:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Alfred Whitehead: “It is more important that a proposition be interesting than it be true.”</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Novelty search as a tool:</strong> While novelty search can be a useful tool, it’s not a universal solution. It may not work for all problems, particularly those involving vast, complex search spaces (e.g., an endless maze).</li>
<li><strong>Myth of the objective:</strong> Despite novelty search’s successes in certain scenarios, the belief in the necessity of objectives persists.</li>
<li><strong>Diversity as a compromise:</strong> One argument is that objectives are still valuable but require a <strong>diversity of ideas</strong> during the search process to avoid being misled by deceptive paths.</li>
<li><strong>Horse racing analogy:</strong> This perspective is compared to betting on multiple horses in a race to increase the chances of winning, suggesting that maintaining a variety of alternatives is beneficial even when pursuing an objective.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-deception-of-objectives-and-the-futility-of-search">The Deception of Objectives and the Futility of Search</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ambitious objectives and deception:</strong> The chapter argues that the more ambitious the objective, the more deceptive it becomes.</li>
<li><strong>False compass analogy:</strong> A deceptive objective acts like a compass pointing in the wrong direction, rendering open-mindedness ineffective.</li>
<li><strong>Maze-navigating robot example:</strong> Even in a simple maze, the objective of reaching the end can be deceptive due to walls that attract the robot based on proximity but hinder actual progress.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations of objectives with novelty:</strong> Combining novelty with objectives doesn’t fully solve the deception problem in ambitious situations.</li>
<li><strong>Five thousand year old computer example:</strong> The objective of building a computer five thousand years ago would have been deeply deceptive, as the necessary stepping stones (e.g., vacuum tubes) were unimaginable at the time.</li>
<li><strong>Futility at the heart of search:</strong> The chapter concludes that no single search approach can guarantee reaching a specific objective, especially for highly ambitious goals.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations of objective-driven search:</strong> The fact that novelty search outperforms objective-driven search in some simple problems raises concerns about the latter’s effectiveness in more complex scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>No Free Lunch Theorem:</strong> This theorem supports the idea that there’s no universally best search algorithm, as improving performance on one set of problems can negatively impact performance on others.</li>
<li><strong>Black box optimization:</strong> This field in machine learning also acknowledges that general rules or heuristics can be misleading in specific circumstances.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-treasure-hunter-embracing-discovery-without-objectives">The Treasure Hunter: Embracing Discovery Without Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finding the unexpected:</strong> Despite the limitations of search, the chapter argues that we can reliably find amazing things, even if we can’t predefine them.</li>
<li><strong>Great discoveries as undefined:</strong> This idea is based on the success of Picbreeder, natural evolution, and human innovation, all of which involve processes without predefined objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Non-objective search as a treasure hunter:</strong> It’s presented as a powerful tool for finding unexpected treasures while exploring the search space.</li>
<li><strong>Picbreeder Car example:</strong> The Picbreeder Car, a surprising and complex image, was discovered without anyone explicitly searching for it, demonstrating the potential of non-objective search.</li>
<li><strong>The paradox of trying vs.&nbsp;not trying:</strong> The chapter highlights the irony that actively trying to achieve a specific objective can hinder progress, while exploring without a fixed goal can lead to unexpected breakthroughs.</li>
<li><strong>Treasure hunter’s approach:</strong> The treasure hunter collects as many stepping stones as possible, recognizing that any one of them could lead to something valuable, even if the ultimate destination is unknown.</li>
<li><strong>Collective exploration:</strong> The chapter emphasizes the importance of diverse individuals with different interests contributing to the exploration of the search space, rather than relying on a single objective or individual.</li>
<li><strong>The inevitability of the future:</strong> While the future may not unfold as planned, the continuous exploration of diverse individuals ensures that unexpected discoveries and advancements will emerge.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Novelty search as a model:</strong> The chapter suggests that novelty search and Picbreeder demonstrate the feasibility of building systems based on non-objective principles.</li>
<li><strong>Human feedback and collaboration:</strong> Human feedback, as seen in Picbreeder, can play a crucial role in guiding non-objective search and capitalizing on the diverse tastes and insights of individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Internet as a platform for treasure hunting:</strong> The internet provides an ideal platform for organizing and facilitating collaborative treasure hunting through interconnected systems.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive catalog example:</strong> The chapter presents the concept of an interactive catalog (e.g., for furniture) where users can explore and “breed” new designs based on existing ones.</li>
<li><strong>Customer-driven design:</strong> This system allows customers to become active participants in the design process, discovering unique and personalized products that wouldn’t have been conceived through traditional methods.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative stepping stone collection:</strong> The catalog evolves into a repository of user-generated designs, each potentially serving as a stepping stone for further exploration and innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Trusting the non-objective catalog:</strong> The chapter raises the question of whether users would trust a catalog where designs are generated through a collaborative, non-objective process rather than by expert designers.</li>
<li><strong>The role of experts:</strong> While acknowledging the importance of expert designers, the chapter suggests that non-objective systems can uncover hidden treasures that experts might miss due to their focus on specific objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Potential of non-objective systems:</strong> The chapter argues that non-objective systems, like the interactive catalog, can lead to the creation of innovative concepts that would otherwise remain undiscovered.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Relinquishing the myth of the objective:</strong> The chapter concludes that we must accept the futility of searching for a guaranteed path to a predetermined destination, especially for ambitious goals.</li>
<li><strong>Embracing the treasure hunter:</strong> Instead, we should embrace the treasure hunter approach, exploring the search space without a fixed objective and collecting stepping stones that may lead to unexpected and valuable discoveries.</li>
<li><strong>Natural evolution, human innovation, Picbreeder, and novelty search as examples:</strong> These examples demonstrate the power and success of non-objective processes in generating innovation and progress.</li>
<li><strong>Liberation from objectives:</strong> Freeing ourselves from the grip of objectives can lead to a new perspective on the world and open up new possibilities for innovation and discovery.</li>
<li><strong>Implications for society:</strong> The next chapters will explore the implications of this non-objective perspective for how we organize and operate our society.</li>
<li><strong>The future of innovation:</strong> The chapter concludes with an optimistic outlook on the future of innovation, suggesting that it will be driven by the collective exploration of diverse individuals without a unified objective, leading to unexpected and exciting discoveries.</li>

<ul>
<li>The chapter opens with captivating stories of early explorers like Magellan, Verrazzano, and Scott who braved the unknown, highlighting the inherent risks and potential rewards of exploration.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation</strong>, particularly in science, is presented as a modern form of exploration with the power to reshape society.</li>
<li>The chapter aims to explore how the <strong>myth of the objective</strong> hinders innovation in various fields, including science, business, and art.</li>
<li>The rapid pace of scientific progress is emphasized through examples like George Washington’s letter-writing predicament and the evolution of communication from handwritten letters to real-time video chats.</li>
<li>The chapter acknowledges that scientific exploration may not be as visually thrilling as geographical expeditions, but the discoveries it yields can be equally transformative, potentially leading to advancements like a universal cure for cancer or cheap energy through nuclear fusion.</li>
<li>The chapter establishes that the pursuit of scientific innovation is often constrained by the <strong>myth of the objective</strong>, particularly in funding decisions, which tend to prioritize projects with clear objectives and predictable outcomes.</li>

<section id="the-problem-with-consensus-in-science-funding" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem-with-consensus-in-science-funding">The Problem with Consensus in Science Funding</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Science funding</strong> is identified as a key area where the myth of the objective plays a significant role.</li>
<li>Government funding agencies like the NSF and ESF rely on <strong>peer review</strong> to evaluate grant proposals, favoring projects that achieve consensus among expert reviewers.</li>
<li>The chapter argues that <strong>consensus can be detrimental to innovation</strong> because it discourages exploration of diverse and potentially groundbreaking ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Picbreeder</strong> is used as an analogy to illustrate how consensus can stifle creativity.
<ul>
<li>Picbreeder’s success in generating novel images stems from the fact that users are free to explore diverse paths without needing to agree on which images are “better.”</li>
<li>If a panel of experts were to vote on the next image in Picbreeder, the number of explored paths would be severely limited.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The chapter suggests that <strong>rewarding disagreement</strong> instead of consensus might be a more effective strategy for promoting innovation.
<ul>
<li>Unanimous agreement on a project might indicate that it merely echoes the status quo.</li>
<li><strong>Interesting ideas are more likely to split expert opinions</strong> because they often challenge existing paradigms and explore uncharted territory.</li>
<li>Examples like Darwin’s theory of evolution and Thomas Kuhn’s concept of paradigm shifts are cited to demonstrate how groundbreaking ideas initially faced resistance from the scientific community.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The chapter clarifies that it’s not advocating for funding all projects with disagreement, but rather suggesting that some resources should be allocated to support <strong>interesting and potentially transformative research</strong>, even if it lacks consensus.</li>
<li>The emphasis on consensus in science funding is linked to <strong>objective thinking</strong>, which prioritizes reaching a predetermined destination over exploring diverse and potentially serendipitous paths.</li>
<li>The chapter concludes that <strong>science needs to embrace the role of a treasure hunter and a stepping stone collector</strong>, allowing researchers to explore diverse and unpredictable paths rather than being solely focused on achieving predefined objectives.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-illusion-of-predictable-scientific-progress-and-impact" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-illusion-of-predictable-scientific-progress-and-impact">The Illusion of Predictable Scientific Progress and Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>The myth of the objective leads to the assumption that scientific progress is predictable and that the stepping stones to important discoveries can be laid out in an orderly fashion.</li>
<li>The chapter challenges this assumption by highlighting the <strong>serendipitous nature of many scientific breakthroughs</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Grand, objective-driven projects</strong> aimed at solving specific problems are discussed, with examples like Japan’s Fifth Generation Computer Systems project and the War on Cancer.
<ul>
<li>These projects, despite significant funding and targeted research, often fail to achieve their stated objectives or produce unexpected outcomes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The chapter acknowledges that some ambitious projects, like the space race, can be successful, but emphasizes that such success often relies on <strong>pre-existing stepping stones</strong> developed outside the scope of the project itself.</li>
<li>The chapter argues that <strong>predicting the impact of scientific research is challenging</strong> and that focusing solely on projects with perceived high impact can be short-sighted.
<ul>
<li>Many important discoveries are unexpected and may not seem immediately impactful.</li>
<li><strong>Interesting research, even if not deemed immediately important, can lead to unanticipated breakthroughs in the future</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Picbreeder and novelty search</strong> are again used as analogies to illustrate how systems can produce remarkable results even when individual components are not evaluated based on their progress towards a specific objective.</li>
<li>The chapter suggests that funding agencies should consider supporting <strong>interesting and potentially transformative research</strong>, even if its immediate impact is unclear.</li>
<li>Examples from pure mathematics, such as group theory and public-key cryptography, are provided to demonstrate how seemingly “useless” research can later have significant practical applications.</li>
<li>The chapter cautions against <strong>funding science based solely on its alignment with specific national interests or short-term economic goals</strong>.
<ul>
<li>This approach can stifle basic research and limit the potential for serendipitous discoveries.</li>
<li>The chapter criticizes policies that prioritize research with immediate economic benefits over curiosity-driven exploration.</li>

<ul>
<li>The chapter argues that <strong>objectives can hinder scientific progress by promoting risk aversion</strong>.</li>
<li>Funding agencies often require researchers to clearly define objectives and demonstrate a high likelihood of success, which can discourage exploration of risky but potentially groundbreaking ideas.</li>
<li>The chapter suggests that <strong>some research should be pursued simply because it’s interesting</strong>, even if the potential outcomes are uncertain.</li>
<li>The chapter proposes funding researchers with a track record of interesting discoveries without requiring them to specify detailed objectives, similar to the MacArthur Fellowships.</li>
<li>The chapter acknowledges that <strong>risk is inherent in scientific research</strong>, and that embracing uncertainty is necessary for achieving significant progress.</li>
<li>The chapter draws a parallel between <strong>business investing and scientific funding</strong>.
<ul>
<li>In business, investors tend to favor projects with <strong>realistic, short-term objectives</strong> that are achievable within a few stepping stones.</li>
<li><strong>Innovative business ideas</strong> often reveal nearby stepping stones that were previously unseen, but investors typically require a clear understanding of these stepping stones before providing funding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The example of Tesla Motors is used to illustrate how <strong>innovation in business can arise from unexpected combinations of existing technologies</strong>.</li>
<li>The chapter concludes that both scientists and businesspeople should focus on exploring <strong>nearby stepping stones</strong> rather than setting overly ambitious long-term objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation often arises from unexpected discoveries</strong> made while exploring seemingly unrelated paths.</li>

<ul>
<li>The chapter suggests that <strong>artists and designers</strong> have a more intuitive understanding of the myth of the objective compared to scientists or businesspeople.</li>
<li><strong>Art is often driven by creative exploration</strong> rather than the pursuit of specific objectives.</li>
<li>The chapter acknowledges that <strong>objectives can play a role in design</strong>, particularly when functionality and safety are concerned.
<ul>
<li>These objectives are compared to the <strong>constraints faced by organisms in natural evolution</strong>, which must survive and reproduce but can do so in a vast array of ways.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The chapter argues that <strong>innovation in art and design often involves finding new ways to work within existing constraints</strong>.</li>
<li>Examples from art history, such as the evolution from Impressionism to Expressionism to Surrealism, are used to demonstrate how <strong>new artistic movements often arise unexpectedly</strong> from the exploration of previous styles.</li>
<li>The chapter highlights that <strong>individual artists may also struggle with the pressure to justify their work in terms of objectives</strong>.
<ul>
<li>The example of an art student who created sculptures by beating metal with an axe and rusting them is used to illustrate this point.</li>

<li>The chapter emphasizes that <strong>non-objective thinking is not a universal solution</strong>, but rather an alternative approach that can lead to greater creativity and innovation in certain contexts.</li>
<li><strong>Escaping the myth of the objective</strong> can be challenging but potentially rewarding, as it allows for exploration of diverse and unpredictable paths.</li>
<li>The chapter encourages readers to <strong>consider the potential of non-objective thinking</strong> in their own lives and endeavors.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The alternative to objective-driven pursuit is to become a treasure hunter.</strong>
<ul>
<li>This involves exploring the unknown and seeking out valuable discoveries, even if they weren’t the initial target.</li>
<li><strong>Stepping stones</strong> are the key: One good idea leads to another, creating a chain of discoveries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Clues</strong> guide the treasure hunter, but these clues are not about the objective itself. Instead, they indicate the potential for something worthwhile nearby.
<ul>
<li><strong>Novelty</strong> can be a clue: Something new may lead to something even newer.
<ul>
<li>Novelty search algorithms in robotics demonstrate this principle: Robots discover complex behaviors by pursuing novelty.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Interestingness</strong> is another crucial clue, particularly for humans:
<ul>
<li>We are drawn to things that pique our interest, whether it’s music, writing, or exploration.</li>
<li>Interestingness is subjective and varies among individuals, but this diversity benefits society.</li>
<li>Following interestingness leads us across unique chains of stepping stones.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Following interestingness</strong> may seem subjective, but it can be a more effective principle than objectivity, especially in the pursuit of discovery and innovation.</li>
<li>The book provides numerous examples where ignoring objectives led to superior results compared to pursuing them.</li>
<li><strong>Justification for following interestingness:</strong>
<ul>
<li>We don’t know the structure of the search space, so we can’t predict which discoveries will be crucial stepping stones.</li>
<li>Interestingness forms a network of interconnected discoveries, leading us from one valuable finding to another.</li>

<ul>
<li>True innovators don’t focus on distant, grandiose visions. Instead, they concentrate on the <strong>edge of what’s currently possible</strong>.</li>
<li>They ask: “Where can we get from here?” rather than “How can we get there?”</li>
<li>They build upon existing capabilities and knowledge, taking small but significant steps forward.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Markus “Notch” Persson</strong> created Minecraft by combining elements from existing games, resulting in a groundbreaking success despite its unconventional design.</li>
<li><strong>Steve Jobs</strong> and Apple recognized the opportune moment for a commercially viable tablet computer (the iPad), capitalizing on existing technological advancements and societal trends.</li>
<li><strong>The Wright brothers</strong> built upon their expertise in bicycles to achieve flight, demonstrating that stepping stones can come from unexpected sources.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Objective-driven companies</strong> often struggle, clinging to ambitious visions that are not yet feasible.</li>
<li><strong>Success often comes from recognizing the potential in the present</strong>, rather than trying to force a preconceived future into existence.</li>

<section id="introduction-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every living organism, including humans, is a product of <strong>natural evolution</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Natural evolution</strong> is an unguided process that has designed every organism on Earth.</li>
<li>Unlike most things, evolution continually creates new from old.</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent design</strong> movement skeptics argue that the complexity of life suggests an intelligent creator.</li>
<li>Charles Darwin’s theory of <strong>natural selection</strong> offers an alternative explanation: slightly imperfect self-copying can lead to the appearance of intelligent design.</li>
<li><strong>Natural selection:</strong> Genes that enhance survival and reproduction are more likely to spread throughout a population.</li>
<li>Evolutionary biologists debate the importance of <strong>natural selection</strong> compared to other evolutionary forces (e.g., chance, history).</li>
<li>This chapter explores an alternative interpretation of <strong>natural evolution</strong> inspired by <strong>non-objective search</strong>.</li>

<section id="survival-of-the-fittest" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="survival-of-the-fittest">Survival of the Fittest</h4>
<ul>
<li>“Survival of the fittest” is a popular catchphrase summarizing a core concept of evolution, though it wasn’t coined by Darwin himself.</li>
<li><strong>Fitness</strong>, in biology, refers to the average number of offspring an organism produces.</li>
<li>“Survival of the fittest” implies a <strong>competitive search</strong> for ever-more-fit organisms.</li>
<li>This perspective aligns with <strong>objective thinking</strong>, suggesting that evolution aims to achieve the objective of maximizing fitness.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="evolution-as-a-progressive-force" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evolution-as-a-progressive-force">Evolution as a Progressive Force</h4>
<ul>
<li>“Survival of the fittest” can lead to the view of evolution as a <strong>bloody competition</strong> where only the fittest survive.</li>
<li>Early evolutionists believed that evolution is <strong>progressive</strong>, striving for an <strong>objective perfection</strong> or an <strong>über-organism</strong>.</li>
<li>Some interpretations place humans as the pinnacle of evolution, suggesting objective superiority over other organisms.</li>
<li>However, a <strong>human-centric view</strong> is not supported by modern biology and leads to the <strong>objective paradox</strong>.
<ul>
<li>If evolution aimed directly at humans, the intermediate steps (e.g., flatworms) wouldn’t resemble the final product, making the path implausible.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="survival-and-reproduction-as-the-objective" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="survival-and-reproduction-as-the-objective">Survival and Reproduction as the Objective</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most scientists consider <strong>survival and reproduction</strong> as evolution’s objective.</li>
<li>All living species inherently survive and reproduce; otherwise, they wouldn’t exist.</li>
<li><strong>Natural selection</strong> drives towards improved survival and reproduction, leading to the view that increasing fitness is evolution’s objective.</li>
<li>This perspective fits the <strong>objective paradigm</strong> and aligns with common understanding.</li>
<li>However, this interpretation faces some challenges:
<ul>
<li><strong>Survive and reproduce</strong> was already achieved at the start of evolution with the first reproducing cell, contradicting the typical notion of an objective as something to be achieved.</li>
<li>If the objective is to maximize fitness, bacteria (with high reproductive rates) would be considered more “successful” than humans, which doesn’t align with our intuition about evolution’s most interesting products.</li>
<li>The diversity of life suggests an <strong>accumulation of stepping stones</strong>, similar to other <strong>non-objective creative processes</strong> (e.g., Picbreeder, human innovation).</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="survive-and-reproduce-as-a-constraint">Survive and Reproduce as a Constraint</h4>
<ul>
<li>Instead of an objective, <strong>survive and reproduce</strong> can be viewed as a <strong>constraint</strong>.</li>
<li>Organisms that fail to reproduce are eliminated, while those that reproduce persist.</li>
<li>This perspective suggests that selection <strong>restricts exploration</strong> by pruning away parts of the search space.</li>

<section id="gentle-earth-thought-experiment" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gentle-earth-thought-experiment">Gentle Earth Thought Experiment</h4>
<ul>
<li>Imagine <strong>Gentle Earth</strong>: a hypothetical world without natural selection where every organism reproduces.</li>
<li>Even organisms that wouldn’t survive on their own are helped to reproduce.</li>
<li>This removes the pressure of selection and allows for broader exploration of the search space.</li>
<li>On Gentle Earth, we would observe all the variety of life on Earth, plus many more organisms that wouldn’t have survived under selection.</li>
<li>This thought experiment demonstrates that selection is not a creative force, but rather a <strong>restrictive force</strong> that limits exploration.</li>

<section id="evolution-as-a-treasure-hunter" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evolution-as-a-treasure-hunter">Evolution as a Treasure Hunter</h4>
<ul>
<li>Evolution accumulates <strong>novelty and diversity</strong>, similar to other <strong>non-objective search processes</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>tree of life</strong> branches outward, collecting new stepping stones as it goes.</li>
<li><strong>Diversity arises from avoiding competition</strong> by founding new niches.</li>
<li>New niches often make founding newer niches possible, leading to a chain reaction of diversification.</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>An organism developing the ability to digest a new compound.</li>
<li>The first land animal to fly escaping land-based predation.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="serendipity-and-exaptation">Serendipity and Exaptation</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Serendipity</strong> plays a significant role in evolution through <strong>mutation</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Mutation:</strong> Slight copying errors during reproduction that can lead to variations in offspring.</li>
<li><strong>Neutral genetic changes</strong> (not affecting fitness) evolve through <strong>genetic drift</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Exaptation:</strong> A feature evolved for one function becomes useful in a different context.</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>Birds’ feathers initially evolved for temperature regulation, later exapted for flight.</li>
<li>Bones initially evolved for mineral storage, later exapted for structural support.</li>
<li>The Picbreeder Car’s wheels exapted from the eyes of the Alien Face.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evolution-as-a-minimal-criteria-search">Evolution as a Minimal Criteria Search</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abstraction</strong> helps to understand natural processes by focusing on essential features and discarding unimportant details.</li>
<li>Viewing “survive and reproduce” as a <strong>constraint</strong> allows us to abstract away fitness differences between successful organisms.</li>
<li>The <strong>single-cell bottleneck</strong> highlights the diversity of methods nature has found to start from one cell and ultimately produce another.</li>
<li>Organisms can be seen as <strong>Rube Goldberg machines</strong>, performing complex processes to achieve the simple goal of reproduction.</li>
<li>Evolution can be viewed as a <strong>minimal criteria search</strong>, accumulating all the different ways to survive and reproduce.</li>
<li>As simple means of living are exhausted, the search explores more complex ones, driven by the “spill” of possibilities expanding in the search space.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-role-of-competition">The Role of Competition</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>spilled-milk view</strong> abstracts away competition entirely.</li>
<li>However, <strong>competition</strong> does play a role in natural evolution, though it may be less important for creativity than <strong>diversity</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Local competition</strong> (within niches) shapes organisms but encourages the founding of new niches to escape competition.</li>
<li><strong>Global competition</strong> (across all organisms) would lead to convergence towards a single optimal organism.</li>
<li><strong>Evolution can be seen as a novelty-generating search with local competition</strong>, balancing creativity and optimization.</li>

<li>Evolution’s creativity arises from <strong>escaping competition</strong> to form new niches, not just from out-competing others.</li>
<li><strong>Diversity</strong> and the <strong>accumulation of stepping stones</strong> are key to evolution’s success.</li>
<li>Evolution is more like <strong>open-ended brainstorming</strong> than single-minded pursuit of a goal.</li>
<li>It’s more about <strong>exploration</strong> than about <strong>bloody competition</strong>.</li>
<li>It’s more like constructing novel <strong>Rube Goldberg machines</strong> than aspiring towards perfection.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Algorithms</strong> are the core product of AI research.
<ul>
<li>AI algorithms are designed to perform a wide range of tasks, from object recognition to game playing.</li>
<li>The ultimate goal is a single algorithm capable of performing all human (and potentially more) tasks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The field of AI can be viewed as a <strong>search for algorithms</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Researchers work together to find new and improved algorithms.</li>
<li>AI researchers also study how to search effectively, creating algorithms that automate search processes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This creates a <strong>meta-search</strong>, where AI researchers search for algorithms that themselves search.
<ul>
<li>This is analogous to searching for a curious puppy or hiring a skilled treasure hunter.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The connection between the AI community’s meta-search and the insights from search algorithms is rarely discussed.

<li>Two main heuristics dominate AI research:
<ul>
<li><strong>Experimentalist Heuristic:</strong> Judges algorithms based on their performance in benchmark tasks. Better performance indicates a more promising algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Theoretical Heuristic:</strong> Favors algorithms that have desirable properties proven through mathematical guarantees.</li>

<section id="problems-with-the-experimentalist-heuristic" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="problems-with-the-experimentalist-heuristic">Problems with the Experimentalist Heuristic</h3>
<ul>
<li>The experimentalist heuristic can lead to <strong>deception</strong>: Algorithms that appear promising based on performance may not lead to further advancements.</li>
<li>Focusing solely on performance can <strong>stifle exploration</strong> and prevent the discovery of novel algorithms that may not initially outperform existing ones.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Algorithm “Weird”</strong>
<ul>
<li>Weird is a novel algorithm that performs 5% worse than the established algorithm “OldReliable” in a standard benchmark.</li>
<li>The experimentalist heuristic would favor rejecting Weird due to its lower performance.</li>
<li>However, rejecting Weird prevents the exploration of its unique potential and the stepping stones it could open up.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The experimentalist heuristic can be likened to a <strong>Chinese finger trap</strong>, encouraging pulling harder (improving performance) when pushing (exploring novel, even if initially worse-performing, directions) might be necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Comparisons between algorithms can be misleading</strong>: The reasons for finding an algorithm interesting may be unrelated to its performance compared to others.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example: Humanoid Robot vs.&nbsp;Windup Toy Footrace</strong>
<ul>
<li>The windup toy wins easily, but this doesn’t invalidate humanoid robot research.</li>
<li>The comparison is irrelevant to the reasons for finding humanoid robots interesting.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The experimentalist heuristic may be suitable for <strong>AI practitioners</strong> who need to choose the best currently available algorithm for a specific task.</li>
<li>However, it is not ideal for <strong>AI researchers</strong> who are searching for future innovations and breakthroughs.</li>
<li>The experimentalist heuristic promotes an <strong>objective-driven search</strong> for perfect performance, which can be counterproductive in complex search spaces like the space of AI algorithms.</li>

<section id="problems-with-the-theoretical-heuristic" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="problems-with-the-theoretical-heuristic">Problems with the Theoretical Heuristic</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>theoretical heuristic</strong> prioritizes algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees.</li>
<li>While guarantees provide certainty, the theoretical heuristic also has limitations.</li>
<li><strong>“Theoretical Heuristic” as a Paradox:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Heuristics are rules of thumb, while theorems offer absolute guarantees.</li>
<li>The term “theoretical heuristic” refers to using theorems (theoretical) as a rule of thumb (heuristic) for judging an algorithm’s potential as a stepping stone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Theorems about individual algorithms do not guarantee progress in the meta-search</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A theorem about algorithm OldReliable doesn’t guarantee that future algorithms derived from it will inherit the same guarantees or be better.</li>
<li>Focusing solely on algorithms with proven guarantees can restrict exploration and prevent the discovery of novel algorithms that may not initially have strong theoretical backing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The theoretical heuristic assumes a specific structure of the search space, where more guarantees indicate closer proximity to AI objectives.
<ul>
<li>This assumption may not hold true in the vast and complex space of AI algorithms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Waiting for guarantees can hinder progress</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If algorithm Weird lacks guarantees but has the potential to lead to an interesting algorithm Weirder, waiting for Weird’s guarantees delays or prevents the discovery of Weirder.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>A “good” AI algorithm should be judged by its potential to inspire new algorithms and research directions</strong>, not solely by its performance.</li>
<li>The AI community’s obsession with performance improvements often leads to incremental advancements that lack significant insights.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Picbreeder community successfully finds complex and meaningful images without relying on objective rules, expert panels, or performance comparisons.</li>
<li>This demonstrates that communities can achieve significant results without rigid objective heuristics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Role of Experts</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Expertise is crucial in evaluating new ideas, but objective heuristics should not replace expert judgment.</li>
<li>Experts should be trusted to use their knowledge and intuition to assess the potential of new algorithms, even if they don’t meet traditional performance or theoretical standards.</li>

<li>Inspiration, elegance, potential to provoke creativity, thought-provoking construction, challenge to the status quo, novelty, analogy to nature, beauty, simplicity, and imagination.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Experts should embrace open-mindedness and consider a broader range of factors when evaluating new ideas</strong>:
<ul>
<li>It’s more challenging to deeply consider an idea’s potential than to rely on simple heuristics.</li>
<li>However, this effort is crucial for fostering innovation and progress in AI research.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Science cannot rely on a fixed method for discovering great ideas</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The most significant advancements often come from unexpected sources and don’t necessarily follow predictable paths.</li>
<li>Open-mindedness and a willingness to explore unconventional ideas are essential for scientific progress.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The AI community, and scientific communities in general, should move beyond rigid objective heuristics and embrace a more open-minded approach to evaluating new ideas, focusing on their potential to inspire further creativity and lead to unforeseen discoveries.<br>
</li>
<li>This shift requires trusting experts to use their judgment and considering a broader range of factors beyond performance and guarantees, ultimately fostering a more fruitful and innovative scientific landscape.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Going Further with CUDA for Python Programmers:</strong> This lecture builds upon the foundational knowledge presented in “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sgKnKbR-WE">Getting Started with CUDA for Python Programmers</a>” and focuses on optimizing CUDA code for performance by leveraging fast memory.</li>
<li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Familiarity with basic CUDA concepts and Python programming, including thread utilization.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended Resources:</strong>
<ul>
<li>“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Massively-Parallel-Processors-Hands/dp/0323912311/">Programming Massively Parallel Processes</a>” (book), Chapter 5.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTmYrKwjSOU">CUDA Mode lecture by Thomas Viehmann</a> (covers Chapter 4 &amp; 5).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lecture Focus:</strong> Utilizing <strong>shared memory</strong>, a faster memory type within the GPU, to improve performance.</li>
<li><strong>Memory Hierarchy:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global Memory:</strong> Default memory used in CUDA, relatively fast but not the fastest.
<ul>
<li>Accessed by all threads.</li>
<li>(e.g., with <code>tensor.cuda()</code> in PyTorch)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shared Memory:</strong> Significantly faster than global memory (about 10x).
<ul>
<li>Accessible only by threads within a specific <strong>block</strong> (on a streaming multiprocessor).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Importance of Memory Access Speed:</strong> Due to the high processing speed of GPUs, memory access becomes a performance bottleneck. Utilizing shared memory effectively is crucial for optimization.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Problem:</strong> Repeated global memory access in the inner loop of the matrix multiplication kernel.</li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> <strong>Tiling</strong> – dividing the matrices into smaller <strong>tiles</strong> and performing the multiplication tile-by-tile.</li>
<li><strong>Tile Width (TW):</strong> The dimension of a square tile (e.g., 16x16).</li>
<li><strong>Process:</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li>Load a tile from <code>m1</code> and a tile from <code>m2</code> into shared memory.</li>
<li>Calculate the partial dot products for all elements within the output tile using the shared memory tiles.</li>
<li>Repeat for all tiles, accumulating the partial dot products to get the final result.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Benefits:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Each input element is read from global memory only once.</li>
<li>Dot products are calculated using much faster shared memory.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>CUDA Kernel (Tiled):</strong> ChatGPT-generated CUDA code based on the tiled Python kernel.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Code auto-generated by ChatGPT 4, using the following prompt:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Convert the following python code to CUDA C, keeping formatting and variable names the same where possible. You can remove <code>blockIdx, threadIdx, blockDim, shared</code> from the argument list, since they’re already provided by CUDA. Change <code>syncb.wait()</code> to <code>__syncthreads</code>. Use <code>extern __shared__ float shared[]</code> to create the <code>shared</code> array. Use the C ternary operator to replace the Python equivalent where appropriate. If the Python code uses any non-standard functions, you can assume the same functions are also available to the translated C code with the same name and signature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The generated code worked first time, although we did some minor cleanups afterwards (e.g.&nbsp;renaming <code>shared</code> to <code>ms</code>).</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Dynamic Shared Memory Allocation:</strong> Uses <code>extern __shared__ float ms[];</code> to declare shared memory dynamically. The size is specified when launching the kernel.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cause:</strong> CUDA struggles to optimize dynamic shared memory allocation when the tile width is not known at compile time, leading to slower performance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use C++ templates to make the tile width a template parameter, enabling the compiler to generate optimized code for specific tile widths.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong></p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The GA102 GPU also features 168 FP64 units (two per SM), which are not depicted in this diagram. The FP64 TFLOP rate is 1/64th the TFLOP rate of FP32 operations. The small number of FP64 hardware units are included to ensure any programs with FP64 code operate correctly, including FP64 Tensor Core code.</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs):</strong>
<ul>
<li>RTX 3090 has 82 SMs.</li>
<li>SMs are largely independent.</li>
<li>Share a common L2 cache.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Floating-Point Cores:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Consumer GPUs lack dedicated FP64 cores.</li>
<li>RTX 3090 has a limited FP64 rate (1/64th of FP32).</li>
<li>Accidental use of FP64 constants can significantly slow down computation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Streaming Multiprocessor Structure:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Each SM has four units, each with:
<ul>
<li>Register file.</li>
<li>Scheduling and dispatch unit (32 threads/clock).</li>
<li>Compute units: 32 FP32 units (half can do INT32).</li>
<li>Tensor cores.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Kernel Execution:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thread blocks</strong> are assigned to SMs (no user control over assignment).</li>
<li>Multiple blocks can be assigned to one SM if resource limits allow.</li>
<li>RTX 3090 can handle up to 1536 threads per SM.</li>
<li>Ideal block size divides 1536 (e.g., 256 or 512).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Warp Execution:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Each SM processes one <strong>warp</strong> (32 threads) at a time.</li>
<li><strong>Warp divergence</strong> occurs when threads within a warp are not in sync, leading to partial execution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Registers:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shared register file (64K 32-bit registers per SM).</li>
<li>Registers are not cleared when switching between warps, requiring careful management of register usage.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>L1 Cache and Shared Memory:</strong>
<ul>
<li>128KB of on-chip memory per SM, split between L1 cache and shared memory.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="threads-warps-and-blocks"><strong>Threads, Warps, and Blocks</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kernel Launch:</strong> Defined by block layout (threads per block) and grid layout (number of blocks).</li>
<li><strong>Thread Block:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Assigned to a single SM.</li>
<li>Threads within a block execute in parallel on the same SM.</li>
<li>Threads within a block can access <strong>shared memory</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Blocks:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Independent of each other.</li>
<li>CUDA assigns blocks to SMs arbitrarily (no programmer control).</li>
<li>Execution order of blocks is not guaranteed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>SM Thread Capacity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>SMs can process more threads than the maximum threads in a block.</li>
<li>Multiple blocks can be assigned to a single SM, if resource limits allow.</li>
<li><strong>Example (RTX 3090):</strong> Maximum 1536 threads per SM.</li>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Choose block sizes (e.g., 256, 512) that divide the maximum thread capacity for optimal SM utilization.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Warp:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A group of 32 threads.</li>
<li>SMs process one warp at a time.</li>
<li><strong>Warp Divergence:</strong> Occurs when threads within a warp follow different execution paths (e.g., due to conditional statements).
<ul>
<li>Leads to reduced performance as only a subset of threads in a warp execute at a time.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>AMD Terminology:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wavefronts:</strong> AMD’s term for warps.</li>
<li>Typically 64 threads, but can be reduced to 32 via compiler options.</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="warp-divergence-and-control-flow"><strong>Warp Divergence and Control Flow</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional GPUs (Single Program Counter per Warp):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conditional Statements (if-else):</strong> Threads not satisfying the condition are disabled, leading to warp divergence.</li>
<li>Only the active threads execute the corresponding branch.</li>
<li>Threads are re-enabled/disabled as needed at each branch point.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Inter-thread communication within a warp is not possible during divergence (waiting threads would stall the warp).</li>
<li>Performance is reduced due to idle threads and sequential execution of branches.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Newer GPUs (&gt;= Volta) (Independent Program Counters):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Each thread has its own program counter.</li>
<li>GPU can interleave execution of different branches, improving utilization.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Can hide memory latency by switching to other warps while one warp waits for memory access.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reconvergence of threads after divergence is not automatic.</li>
<li>Requires explicit synchronization using <code>__syncwarp()</code> to ensure all threads are at the same point before continuing.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Loop Divergence:</strong> Similar divergence occurs in loops with variable iteration counts across threads in a warp.</li>

<section id="achieving-good-occupancy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="achieving-good-occupancy"><strong>Achieving Good Occupancy</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Occupancy:</strong> A measure of how well the GPU’s resources are utilized.</li>
<li><strong>Goals:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Keep all SMs busy.</li>
<li>Maximize the number of active threads per SM.</li>
<li>Minimize warp divergence.</li>
<li>Avoid slow FP64 and INT64 operations (especially on consumer GPUs).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Many Blocks:</strong> Utilize all available SMs.</li>
<li><strong>Optimal Block Size:</strong> Choose a power of two smaller than 512 (or a divisor of the maximum threads per SM) to maximize concurrent threads.</li>
<li><strong>Minimize Divergence:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Use conditional load/store instructions to avoid control flow divergence.</li>
<li>Structure code to minimize branching within warps.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Avoid FP64/INT64:</strong> Use FP32/INT32 whenever possible for better performance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shared Memory and Registers:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Excessive use of shared memory or registers can limit the number of threads scheduled per SM.</li>
<li><strong>Launch Bounds:</strong> Use <code>__launch_bounds__</code> to advise the compiler about expected thread counts, allowing for better register allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Register Spills:</strong> If register usage exceeds the limit, variables are spilled to slower local memory, impacting performance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Occupancy Calculation Tools:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Previously:</strong> Excel sheets.</li>
<li><strong>Currently:</strong> NVIDIA Nsight Compute provides occupancy analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Helps analyze the performance limitations of a kernel.</li>
<li><strong>Computational Intensity:</strong> Key metric, defined as the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) per byte of memory transfer.</li>
<li><strong>Memory-Bound Kernels:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Low computational intensity.</li>
<li>Performance limited by memory bandwidth.</li>
<li>Throughput limited by the diagonal line in the roofline model representing memory bandwidth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Compute-Bound Kernels:</strong>
<ul>
<li>High computational intensity.</li>
<li>Performance limited by the GPU’s compute capabilities.</li>
<li>Throughput limited by the horizontal line in the roofline model representing peak compute performance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Roofline Shape:</strong> The characteristic “roof” shape arises from the fact that memory latency can be hidden if other warps can compute while one warp waits for memory.

<li>The performance becomes the maximum of the memory bandwidth and compute throughput, leading to the minimum of the two limiting factors.</li>

<li><strong>Registers:</strong> Fastest, used for local variables within a thread.</li>
<li><strong>Local Memory:</strong> Slower than registers, used for arrays declared within a thread or for register spills.</li>
<li><strong>Shared Memory:</strong> Per-block memory, faster than global memory, accessible by all threads in a block, declared using <code>__shared__</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Global Memory:</strong> Main GPU memory, accessible by all threads, typically accessed through pointers.</li>
<li><strong>Constant Memory:</strong> Read-only memory, cached, used for kernel launch parameters and can be explicitly declared.</li>

<li><p><strong>Tiled Matrix Multiplication (Square Matrices):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tile Size:</strong> A parameter that determines the size of the tiles.</li>
<li><strong>Thread Block:</strong> Typically, the tile size squared (e.g., <code>16x16</code> threads for a tile size of <code>16</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Shared Memory:</strong> Two shared memory arrays to store tiles from matrices A and B.</li>
<li><strong>Algorithm:</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li>Load tiles from global memory into shared memory.</li>
<li>Perform matrix multiplication within the tiles using shared memory.</li>
<li>Loop over all tiles to compute the complete result.</li>
<li>Store the result back to global memory.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Synchronization:</strong> <code>__syncthreads()</code> is crucial to ensure that all threads have finished reading/writing to shared memory before proceeding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Padding:</strong> For matrices where the size is not a multiple of the tile size, padding with zeros is used to complete the tiles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Performance Improvement:</strong> Reduces memory accesses and improves performance (e.g., from 426 microseconds to 323 microseconds in the example).</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cuda-blocks-and-threads">6. CUDA Blocks and Threads</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Blocks and Threads:</strong> CUDA organizes kernel execution into blocks and threads.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blocks:</strong> Groups of threads.</li>
<li><strong>Threads:</strong> Individual execution units within a block.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Kernel Runner with Blocks and Threads:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CUDA kernel execution is simulated using nested for loops (one for blocks, one for threads).</li>
<li>Each thread gets a unique index calculated from its block index and thread index.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Reason for Blocks and Threads:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared Memory:</strong> Threads within a block share a small, fast memory space (shared memory).
<ul>
<li>256 KB Register File &amp; 128 KB of L1/Shared Memory in an RTX 3090</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Synchronization:</strong> Threads within a block can synchronize their execution.</li>
<li><strong>Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) Execution:</strong> All threads within a block are executed on the same SM.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Choosing Block and Thread Dimensions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Threads per Block:</strong> Often set to 256 as a default.</li>
<li><strong>Number of Blocks:</strong> Calculated based on the total number of iterations needed and the threads per block.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Guard Block:</strong> An <code>if</code> statement within the kernel to prevent out-of-bounds memory access due to potential block size mismatches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Python Block Kernel:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Writing CUDA Kernels:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use ChatGPT to convert Python kernel code to C++ CUDA code (or write it manually if comfortable with C++).</li>
<li>Adapt the code to CUDA syntax (e.g., <code>blockidx.x</code>, <code>blockdim.x</code>, <code>threadidx.x</code>, data types, semicolons).</li>
<li>Use <code>unsigned char*</code> for <code>uint8</code> (byte) data type in C++.</li>
<li><strong><code>__global__</code>:</strong> A CUDA keyword that indicates a kernel function callable from the CPU and executed on the GPU.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Calling CUDA Kernels:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use triple angle brackets (<code>&lt;&lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>) to launch a CUDA kernel.</li>
<li>Specify the number of blocks and threads per block within the brackets.</li>
<li>Pass tensor arguments using <code>.data_ptr&lt;data_type&gt;()</code> to get C++ pointers.</li>
<li>Use <code>input.options()</code> to create output tensors with the same data type and device as the input tensor.</li>
<li>Use <code>TORCH_CHECK</code> to check for CUDA errors after kernel execution.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Kernel Design:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The innermost loop (dot product calculation) is implemented as a CUDA kernel.</li>
<li>Each CUDA thread will calculate the dot product for one element in the output matrix.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>2D Blocks and Threads:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CUDA allows for 2D (or even 3D) blocks and threads.</li>
<li>Blocks and threads are indexed using x and y coordinates (e.g., block(3, 4), thread(6, 12)).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Kernel Runner with 2D Blocks and Threads:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Uses four nested for loops to iterate through blocks and threads in both x and y dimensions.</li>
<li>Passes block and thread index information to the kernel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>CUDA Kernel Implementation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Uses a guard block to prevent out-of-bounds memory access.</li>
<li>Calculates row and column indices from block and thread indices.</li>
<li>Performs the dot product calculation and stores the result in the output matrix.</li>

<section id="the-importance-of-evaluation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-importance-of-evaluation">The Importance of Evaluation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional Evals vs.&nbsp;LLM Evals</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Shreya Shankar</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Traditional evaluation methods often fail to uncover issues arising from real-world data idiosyncrasies (e.g., typos, inconsistent casing).</li>
<li>Canonical benchmarks and datasets often rely on clean, pre-processed data, which does not reflect real-world data challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Mistral struggles to retrieve names from documents if the name is in lowercase.</li>
<li>Traditional evals often lack methods for validating the evaluation methods themselves.</li>
<li>LLM-based evals can make evaluation more accessible to smaller teams who lack resources for traditional methods.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12272">EvalGen Paper</a></strong>: Discusses a flow-based approach to validating evaluation methods and constructing appropriate evals for deployment.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Overcoming Barriers to Evaluation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Developers often struggle with the concept of evals and how to get started.</li>
<li>Shreya Shankar’s research tools provide a visual, intuitive approach to building and understanding evals, similar to Scratch for programming.</li>
<li>This “Scratch for evals” approach makes evals more accessible and understandable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Evaluation as an Integral Part of AI Development</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Evaluation is not optional, it’s an essential part of the AI development process.</li>
<li>Evals are not separate from building AI, they are how you build AI.</li>
<li>Measuring progress and having a systematic approach to improvement are critical.</li>
<li>Focus on making evals frictionless and integrated into the workflow to enable continuous improvement.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shifting the Focus from Tools to Process</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Developers often focus on tools (e.g., vector databases, embeddings) rather than understanding the underlying process of building and improving AI applications.</li>
<li>It’s essential to shift the focus from tools to the process of evaluation and data understanding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Evaluation as a Proxy for Loss Functions</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Traditional machine learning relies on explicit loss functions for optimization.</li>
<li>In generative AI, the loss functions are less defined, and evals act as a proxy for measuring progress and alignment with desired outcomes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="underappreciated-aspects-of-llm-development" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="underappreciated-aspects-of-llm-development">Underappreciated Aspects of LLM Development</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equipping Engineers with LLM Skills</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Organizations need to focus on training existing software engineers to understand and effectively use LLMs.</li>
<li>Key areas for training:
<ul>
<li>Basic evaluation methods (e.g., using synthetic data, Kaggle datasets).</li>
<li>Understanding the autoregressive nature of LLM generation and its impact on latency.</li>
<li>Understanding context as conditioning.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Moving from Prototype to Production</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The industry has focused heavily on demos and prototypes, and the bar for “production” has been lowered with generative AI.</li>
<li><strong>Prototype++</strong>: Products are being launched without rigorous evaluation or clear methods for quantifying improvements.</li>
<li>The definition of “production” should include systematic improvement processes and clear evidence of progress for stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Challenge</strong>: Moving from prototype++ to true production-ready LLM applications with robust evals and improvement processes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Data Literacy</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Data literacy is essential for working with LLMs, even if you are not training models from scratch.</li>
<li>Data literacy enables developers to:
<ul>
<li><strong>Analyze and debug systems</strong>: By examining data, developers can identify issues and understand system behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Develop domain-specific evals</strong>: Understanding the data is crucial for creating meaningful and effective evaluation methods.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenge</strong>: Overcoming the misconception that AI automates everything and realizing the ongoing need to look at and understand data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Specific Data Literacy Skills</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Assessing Output Quality</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Develop methods for determining whether an output is good or bad.</li>
<li>Use a combination of binary indicators (e.g., conciseness, tone, presence of specific phrases) to simplify evaluation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pairwise Comparisons</strong>: Compare two models or pipelines directly instead of relying on individual ratings.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding Implicit Constraints</strong>: Define criteria for “good” that align with user expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Simplifying Evaluation</strong>: Break down complex evaluation tasks into smaller, more manageable binary assessments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Role of Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Importance of manual data labeling and review, especially in the early stages of development.</li>
<li>“Homework” approach at Hex: Team members use interactive Hex applications to provide feedback on model outputs and assist with data labeling.</li>
<li>This process helps to bootstrap data sets and align LLM evaluations with human judgment.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="misconceptions-and-knowledge-gaps-in-organizations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="misconceptions-and-knowledge-gaps-in-organizations">Misconceptions and Knowledge Gaps in Organizations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The “AI Engineer” Narrative and Its Limitations</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Popular Characterization</strong>:
<ul>
<li>AI engineers are portrayed as primarily focused on tools, infrastructure, chains, and agents, with limited involvement in training, evals, inference, and data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Skills Gaps</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Neglecting data literacy and evaluation skills creates significant challenges beyond the MVP stage.</li>
<li>AI engineers may find themselves unable to systematically improve their applications due to a lack of understanding of data and evaluation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Title Issues</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The “AI engineer” title sets unrealistic expectations and places undue pressure on individuals when projects face challenges.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Addressing the Talent Gap</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The most significant impact on AI product development is the talent and skills of the team.</li>
<li>Organizations need to hire for data literacy and evaluation expertise, not just tooling and infrastructure skills.</li>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<pre class="text"><code>Given a query and a passage, you must provide a score on an
integer scale of 0 to 3 with the following meanings:
0 = represent that the passage has nothing to do with the query,
1 = represents that the passage seems related to the query but
does not answer it,
2 = represents that the passage has some answer for the query,
but the answer may be a bit unclear, or hidden amongst extraneous
information and
3 = represents that the passage is dedicated to the query and
contains the exact answer.

Important Instruction: Assign category 1 if the passage is
somewhat related to the topic but not completely, category 2 if
passage presents something very important related to the entire
topic but also has some extra information and category 3 if the
passage only and entirely refers to the topic. If none of the
above satisfies give it category 0.

Query: {query}
Passage: {passage}

Split this problem into steps:
Consider the underlying intent of the search.
Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query
(M).
Measure how trustworthy the passage is (T).
Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each,
and decide on a final score (O). Final score must be an integer
value only.
Do not provide any code in result. Provide each score in the
format of: ##final score: score without providing any reasoning.</code></pre>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="representational-approaches-and-scoring-functions">Representational Approaches and Scoring Functions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivation for Efficient Retrieval:</strong> Avoid scoring all documents in the collection for each query.</li>
<li><strong>Sparse Representations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Term-based:</strong> Documents and queries are represented by the presence and weight of terms.</li>
<li><strong>Efficient Retrieval:</strong> Inverted indexes, algorithms like WAND and MaxScore.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Keyword search technologies like Elasticsearch and Vespa.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dense Representations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embedding-based:</strong> Documents and queries are represented by vectors in a latent space.</li>
<li><strong>Neural/Sparse Embedding Models:</strong> Learn term weights using transformer models.</li>
<li><strong>Efficient Retrieval:</strong> Approximate Nearest Neighbor search, vector databases.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Text embedding models, semantic search.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Advantages of Dense Representations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Capture semantic relationships between words and concepts.</li>
<li>Enable search based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenges of Dense Representations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transfer Learning:</strong> Off-the-shelf models may not perform well on specific data.</li>
<li><strong>Diluted Representations:</strong> Averaging token embeddings into a single vector can lose information.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed Vocabulary:</strong> Out-of-vocabulary words can be mapped to incorrect concepts.</li>
<li><strong>Chunking:</strong> Long documents need to be chunked to maintain precision.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Baselines for Comparison:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>BM25:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Term-based scoring function.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Unsupervised, based on corpus statistics.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cheap, small index footprint.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Strong baseline for many tasks.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Requires language-specific tokenization, struggles with long context.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> BM25 outperforming embedding models on long context documents in ColBERT evaluation.

<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Do you have any thoughts on calibration of different indices? How can we obtain confidence scores for recommendations?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Different scoring functions (e.g., BM25, cosine similarity) have different distributions and ranges, making calibration difficult. Scores are not probabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Task:</strong> Combining scores effectively is a learning problem.</li>
<li><strong>GBDT’s Strength:</strong> Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) can learn non-linear combinations of features, including different scoring functions.</li>
<li><strong>Need for Training Data:</strong> Calibration and learning require training data.</li>
<li><strong>Options for Training Data:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evaluation Data:</strong> The evaluation datasets described earlier can be used to generate training data.</li>
<li><strong>Real User Interactions:</strong> Gather data from user searches and clicks (like Google).</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q3-efficacy-of-re-rankers">Q3: Efficacy of Re-rankers</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> What are your observations on the efficacy of re-rankers? Do you recommend using them?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phased Retrieval and Ranking:</strong> Re-rankers are valuable in multi-stage pipelines. They allow you to invest more compute into fewer, more promising hits retrieved in earlier stages.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits of Re-rankers:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Token-Level Interaction:</strong> Re-rankers like Cohere or cross-encoders enable deeper interaction between the query and document at the token level, improving accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Latency Management:</strong> By focusing on a smaller set of candidates, re-rankers can help meet latency requirements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> Re-rankers add computational cost and latency.</li>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> If accuracy is a priority and the cost is acceptable, re-rankers are recommended.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Do you have advice on combining usage data (e.g., number of views) with semantic similarity?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning to Rank Problem:</strong> Integrating usage data turns it into a learning to rank problem.</li>
<li><strong>Label Generation:</strong> Convert interaction data into labeled training data. Different interactions (e.g., views, clicks, add-to-cart) may have different weights in the label generation process.</li>
<li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Train a ranking model (e.g., GBDT) using the labeled data, including semantic similarity scores and usage data as features.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q6-recent-advancements-in-text-embedding-models">Q6: Recent Advancements in Text Embedding Models</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> What are some of your favorite advancements recently in text embedding models or other search technologies?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Larger Vocabularies:</strong> Jo hopes for embedding models with larger vocabularies to better handle out-of-vocabulary words, especially in specialized domains. BERT’s vocabulary is outdated.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Pre-trained Models:</strong> Better pre-training techniques and data can lead to more robust and generalizable embedding models.</li>
<li><strong>Caution on Long Context:</strong> Jo is not overly enthusiastic about increasing context length for embedding models. Research suggests diminishing returns for high-precision search with very long contexts.</li>

<section id="q7-query-expansion-with-bm25" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q7-query-expansion-with-bm25">Q7: Query Expansion with BM25</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Does query expansion of out-of-vocabulary words with BM25 work better at search? Are people utilizing classical search techniques like query expansion enough?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>BM25 and Re-ranking:</strong> Combining BM25 with a re-ranker can yield excellent results. While BM25 may struggle with single-word queries that are out-of-vocabulary, it avoids the severe failure modes of relying solely on embedding-based search.</li>
<li><strong>Query Expansion’s Potential:</strong> Query expansion and understanding are powerful techniques. Language models can be used for query expansion, and tools for prompting LLMs for this purpose are improving.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Evaluation:</strong> Building your own evaluation setup allows you to systematically test different techniques like query expansion on your specific data and determine their effectiveness.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q8-handling-jargon-and-tokenization-issues">Q8: Handling Jargon and Tokenization Issues</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How do you overcome limitations in fixed vocabulary and poor tokenization in domains with a lot of jargon, when using an out-of-the-box model?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hybrid Approach:</strong> Combine keyword search with embedding retrieval to mitigate vocabulary limitations.</li>
<li><strong>Challenge of Ignoring Embedding Results:</strong> Embedding retrieval always returns results, even if they are not semantically relevant. It’s crucial to identify and filter out these irrelevant results.</li>
<li><strong>Fine-tuning:</strong> Fine-tuning your own embedding model on domain-specific data can help, but vocabulary limitations may persist.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-training from Scratch:</strong> Training a BERT-like model from scratch with a custom vocabulary tailored to the domain is becoming more feasible.
<ul>
<li>This is a common practice in e-commerce.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q9-colbert-and-tokenizer-problems">Q9: ColBERT and Tokenizer Problems</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Would ColBERT-based methods improve retrieval when we are concerned with tokenizer problems?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>ColBERT’s Approach:</strong> ColBERT learns token-level vector representations instead of a single vector for the whole passage or query. It offers high accuracy while being computationally less expensive than cross-encoders.</li>
<li><strong>Vocabulary Limitations:</strong> ColBERT still relies on the same vocabulary as other BERT-based models, so it’s not a complete solution to tokenizer problems.</li>
<li><strong>Future Direction:</strong> Better pre-trained models with larger vocabularies would benefit ColBERT and other embedding models.</li>

<section id="objective-selection" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="objective-selection">1. Objective Selection:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> The objective significantly impacts data preparation, training data volume, fine-tuning complexity, and model usage.</li>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Choose the simplest objective that meets the use case requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Common Objectives:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single-Turn Forced Call (Routing Use Case):</strong>
<ul>
<li>User provides a single instruction.</li>
<li>Model maps the instruction to one of several pre-defined functions and its parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Forced Call:</strong> The model is constrained to respond with a function call, not natural language.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> User requests the current stock price of Nvidia, the model identifies the appropriate function and its parameters.
<ul>
<li><pre class="text"><code>User: What is the stock price of Nvidia?

Assistant: {
  "name": "get_stock_price",
  "arguments": {"ticker": "NVDA"}
}</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Parallel Function Calling:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Similar to single-turn forced call, but the model can call multiple independent functions in parallel.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Retrieving stock prices for multiple companies simultaneously.
<ul>
<li><pre class="text"><code>User: What is the stock price of Nvidia and Apple?

Assistant: [
  {
    "name": "get_stock_price",
    "arguments": {"ticker": "NVDA"}
  },
  {
    "name": "get_stock_price",
    "arguments": {"ticker": "AAPL"}
  }
]</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Nested Function Calls:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Model calls functions sequentially, with the output of one function feeding into the next.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Retrieving stock prices and then using those prices to generate a plot.
<ul>
<li><pre class="text"><code>User: Plot the stock price of Nvidia and Apple over the last two weeks

Assistant: [
  {
    "name": "get_stock_price",
    "arguments": {"ticker": "NVDA", "start_time": "2 weeks ago"}
  },
  {
    "name": "get_stock_price",
    "arguments": {"ticker": "AAPL", "start_time": "2 weeks ago"}
  }
]

Tool: {"NVDA": [120, 121, …],"AAPL": [192, 190, …]}

Assistant: {
  "name": "plot",
  "arguments": {"NVDA": [120, 121, …],"AAPL": [192, 190, …]}
}</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Implementation:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Role:</strong> Client interacting with the model.</li>
<li><strong>Assistant Role:</strong> The LLM generating function calls.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Role:</strong> Client-side component that executes function calls and returns results to the model.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Multi-Turn Chat with Optional Function Calling:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Most complex objective, combining natural language conversation with optional function calls.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> User asks for news, model fetches trending news, summarizes them, and engages in further conversation.
<ul>
<li><pre class="text"><code>User: What's in the news today?

Assistant: {"name": "trending_news"}

Tool: {
  "headlines": [
    "Nvidia market cap surpasses Apple", …
  ]
}

Assistant: Nvidia is now more valuable than Apple

User: What is Nvidia stock price?

Assistant: {
  "name": "get_stock_price",
  "arguments": {"ticker": "NVDA"}
}</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="function-call-token" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="function-call-token">2. Function Call Token:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Indicate to the client when the model is switching to function call mode.</li>
<li>Enable efficient parsing of model responses, especially in mixed natural language and function call outputs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Introduce a special token to prefix function calls.
<ul>
<li><pre class="text"><code>  Assistant: &lt;function_call_token&gt;{
    "name": "get_stock_price",
    "arguments": {"ticker": "NVDA"}
  }</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Benefits:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Easier parsing of model responses.</li>
<li>Improved <strong>streaming generation</strong> by enabling the client to wait for the entire function call signature before processing.</li>
<li>Facilitates <strong>constraint generation</strong>, ensuring the model adheres to predefined function schemas.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="syntax-for-function-calling" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="syntax-for-function-calling">3. Syntax for Function Calling:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Options:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Python Syntax:</strong> Generate function calls using Python function call signature syntax.</li>
<li><strong>JSON Schema:</strong> Generate JSON structures describing the function name and parameters.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Trade-offs:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Python Syntax:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Easier for LLMs to generate due to extensive training on Python code.</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Less natural for representing complex, nested parameter structures within a single-line invocation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>JSON Schema:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Better suited for complex, nested parameter types; easier to enforce schema with constraint generation; compatible with OpenAI APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Potentially more challenging for LLMs to generate compared to Python syntax.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<section id="preserving-existing-model-capabilities" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="preserving-existing-model-capabilities">4. Preserving Existing Model Capabilities:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Fine-tuning for function calling can inadvertently degrade pre-existing instruction following and general language capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Recommendations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fine-tune on Instruction-Tuned Models:</strong> Use the “Instruct” version of the base model instead of the “Base” version when mixing general chat with function calling.
<ul>
<li>Using the “Base” version is fine for forced function calling.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reduce Training Data:</strong> Minimize the amount of training data to reduce the risk of overwriting existing capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>High-Quality Data:</strong> Use a smaller volume of carefully curated, high-quality training data.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="full-weight-tuning-vs.-lora-tuning" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="full-weight-tuning-vs.-lora-tuning">5. Full-Weight Tuning vs.&nbsp;LoRA Tuning:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> LoRA tuning is generally sufficient and preferable for function calling, particularly in low-data regimes.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of LoRA:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fewer parameters to converge, leading to faster training and better results with limited data.</li>
<li>Faster iteration cycles, enabling more experimentation.</li>
<li>Lower hosting and experimentation costs, especially with efficient LoRA serving solutions like Fireworks AI’s platform.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="constraint-generation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="constraint-generation">6. Constraint Generation:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Reduce hallucinations in model-generated function calls by leveraging the known schema of available functions.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Provide the model with the schema of the functions (e.g., function name, parameter names and types).</li>
<li>Use a constraint generation mechanism (like a <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs103/cs103.1164/lectures/18/Small18.pdf">context-free grammar</a>) to guide the model’s output and enforce adherence to the schema.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Benefits:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduced Hallucinations:</strong> Significantly minimizes or even eliminates hallucinations in function call outputs.</li>
<li><strong>Faster Generation:</strong> Enables short-circuiting generation by autocompleting predictable tokens based on the grammar, improving inference speed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fireworks AI:</strong> Offers constraint generation support for function calling, requiring users to provide the function schemas.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenges-in-fine-tuning-for-function-calling">Challenges in Fine-tuning for Function Calling</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Scarcity:</strong> Unlike general language modeling, readily available datasets for function calling are limited.
<ul>
<li>Existing datasets often focus on specific use cases (e.g., GPT-4 conversations or a limited number of functions).</li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> Invest in building custom datasets.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Data Set Design:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define Data Categories:</strong> Consider types of function calls (parallel, nested), number of turns, and number of functions supported.
<ul>
<li><strong>Parallel function calling:</strong> Multiple functions are called simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>Nested function calling:</strong> Functions are called within other functions.</li>
<li><strong>Turn-based conversations:</strong> Single-turn or multi-turn interactions (e.g., exceeding 10 turns).</li>
<li><strong>Number of functions supported:</strong> Fine-tuning for a small set of functions (e.g., 5) is different from tuning for a larger set (e.g., 50).</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-fine-tuning-when-to-use-it">What is fine-tuning? When to use it?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is fine-tuning?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Training a model to follow a set of input-output examples.</li>
<li>Teaching the model to output specific responses for given inputs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>When to use fine-tuning?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Following a specific format or tone:</strong> e.g., writing in a consistent style.</li>
<li><strong>Processing input in a particular way:</strong> e.g., extracting specific information from text.</li>
<li><strong>Following complex instructions:</strong> When the base model struggles with specific instructions.</li>
<li><strong>Improving latency (speed) and reducing token usage (cost):</strong> Compared to multi-shot prompting, fine-tuning can be faster and cheaper.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>When NOT to use fine-tuning?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teaching the model new knowledge:</strong> Fine-tuning is not effective for adding new information to the model’s knowledge base. Use RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) or custom models for this purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Performing multiple, unrelated tasks:</strong> A single fine-tuned model is best suited for one task. Create separate models for different tasks or use prompt engineering.</li>
<li><strong>Including up-to-date information:</strong> Fine-tuning is not suitable for incorporating real-time or constantly changing data.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="custom-models-and-real-world-fine-tuning-examples" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="custom-models-and-real-world-fine-tuning-examples">Custom Models and Real-World Fine-tuning Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> What are “custom models”?
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custom models</strong> involve a deeper level of collaboration with OpenAI.</li>
<li>OpenAI works with select partners to train and refine models using large datasets over several months.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> OpenAI collaborated with Harvey, a legal tech company, to create a model trained on case law. This model excels in legal tasks and significantly reduces hallucinations compared to the base GPT model.
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog Post:</strong> <a href="https://openai.com/index/harvey/">Harvey</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Are there detailed examples of fine-tuning for real-world use cases, including training data and prompts?
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>OpenAI’s cookbook (<a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/">cookbook.openai.com</a>) offers a Q&amp;A model example.
<ul>
<li>The model is trained to respond with “I don’t know” when it lacks relevant knowledge.</li>
<li>This example demonstrates how fine-tuning can improve a model’s ability to recognize its limitations.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Repository:</strong> <a href="examples/fine-tuned_qa">examples/fine-tuned_qa</a></li>
<li><strong>Notebook 1:</strong> <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/fine-tuned_qa/olympics-1-collect-data">Fine-Tuned Q&amp;A - collect data</a></li>
<li><strong>Notebook 2:</strong> <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/fine-tuned_qa/olympics-2-create-qa">Fine-Tuned Q&amp;A - create Q&amp;A</a></li>
<li><strong>Notebook 3:</strong> <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/fine-tuned_qa/olympics-3-train-qa">Fine-Tuned Q&amp;A - train</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The “<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/optimizing-llm-accuracy">Optimizing LLMs for Accuracy</a>” guide on the OpenAI developer site provides a helpful framework for deciding when to use fine-tuning, RAG, or both.
<ul>
<li>The guide includes a chart illustrating different approaches based on the need for adding context versus optimizing responses.</li>

</section>
<section id="a-combined-approach" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-combined-approach">A Combined Approach</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> What does it mean to combine fine-tuning and RAG, as shown in the upper-right quadrant of the “Optimizing LLMs” chart?
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The chart depicts a general progression, but specific applications may not require all steps.</li>
<li>Combining fine-tuning and RAG involves:
<ul>
<li>Using RAG to introduce new knowledge or context.</li>
<li>Using fine-tuning to modify the model’s response style or instruction-following capabilities.</li>

<section id="importance-of-evals-evaluation-metrics" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="importance-of-evals-evaluation-metrics">Importance of Evals (Evaluation Metrics)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Define your own set of <strong>evals</strong> (evaluation metrics) tailored to your application’s specific needs.</li>
<li><strong>Why not use standard benchmarks?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Standard benchmarks might not accurately reflect your application’s requirements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Create evals based on real prompts and desired responses from your application.</li>

<section id="a-cautionary-tale-when-fine-tuning-goes-wrong" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-cautionary-tale-when-fine-tuning-goes-wrong">A Cautionary Tale: When Fine-tuning Goes Wrong</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> A company tried to create a Slack bot using fine-tuning on their entire Slack corpus.
<ul>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> The bot was intended to answer onboarding questions from new employees.</li>
<li><strong>Problem:</strong> The model learned the format of Slack responses but not the underlying information.
<ul>
<li>It often responded with deferrals like “I’ll do that tomorrow” or “Okay.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reason for Failure:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The model focused on replicating common responses instead of understanding the content.</li>
<li>This approach violated the principle of not using fine-tuning to add new knowledge.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Better Approach:</strong> Using RAG on the Slack data to provide the model with relevant information.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="preparing-data-for-fine-tuning" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="preparing-data-for-fine-tuning">Preparing Data for Fine-tuning</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Format:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Similar to the chat completions API, using system, user, and assistant messages.</li>
<li>Include the desired assistant response for each user message.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation:</strong> <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/chat-input">Training format for chat models</a></li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Recommendations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number of Examples:</strong> 50-100 examples per task.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on a Single Task:</strong> Use a single fine-tuned model for one specific task.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency in Prompt Structure:</strong> Maintain consistency between the prompt structure used in fine-tuning and in actual application calls.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section id="handling-multi-turn-conversations-and-internal-thoughts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="handling-multi-turn-conversations-and-internal-thoughts">Handling Multi-Turn Conversations and Internal Thoughts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How to handle multi-turn conversations with RAG, function calling, and internal thoughts (generated by tools like Langchain) during fine-tuning data preparation? Should all internal thoughts be included, even if they are not always present in production?
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Experiment with the <strong>weight parameter</strong> to control which parts of the conversation the model should focus on learning.</li>
<li>The weight parameter allows you to assign different levels of importance to different messages in the training data.</li>
<li><strong>General Advice:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Avoid excessive complexity in fine-tuning. If multi-turn conversations prove too complex, consider simplifying or using alternative approaches.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Follow-up Question:</strong> Is a weight parameter of 0 equivalent to setting the label of those tokens to -100 (effectively ignoring them)?
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A weight of 0 means the model won’t learn how to generate those specific messages (e.g., user and system messages).</li>
<li>However, it will still use them as context when learning how to generate other messages.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evolution-of-the-weight-parameter-and-openais-development-process">Evolution of the Weight Parameter and OpenAI’s Development Process</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observation:</strong> The introduction of the weight parameter was a significant development. However, its rollout wasn’t widely publicized.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How does OpenAI decide on new features and gather feedback? Could this process be more transparent?
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>OpenAI gathers feedback from various sources:
<ul>
<li>OpenAI Developer Forum</li>
<li>Direct customer interactions</li>
<li>Account managers</li>
<li>Events, conferences, and talks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The weight parameter was a direct result of this feedback process.</li>
<li>OpenAI acknowledges the importance of a more prominent announcement for such features.</li>
<li><strong>Future Direction:</strong> OpenAI plans to continue adding models, methods, and customization options to its fine-tuning platform.</li>

<li>Higher epochs risk overfitting, lower epochs might lead to underfitting.</li>
<li>OpenAI automatically chooses a default based on dataset size.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Batch Size and Learning Rate Multiplier:</strong> Have less impact but can be adjusted for optimization.
<ul>
<li>Larger batch sizes tend to work better for larger datasets.</li>
<li>Experiment with learning rates between <code>0.02-0.2</code>.</li>
<li>Larger learning rates often perform better with larger batch sizes</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Start with defaults and adjust based on eval results.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="success-stories-and-performance-improvements">Success Stories and Performance Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Case Study 1:</strong> Fine-tuning a larger model (GPT-4) for an Icelandic government project resulted in significant improvements in grammar correction compared to the base model and other approaches.</li>
<li><strong>Case Study 2:</strong> Fine-tuning GPT-3.5 outperformed GPT-4 with few-shot prompting in a specific task, highlighting potential cost and latency benefits.</li>

<section id="function-calling-and-fine-tuning-considerations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="function-calling-and-fine-tuning-considerations">Function Calling and Fine-tuning Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Case:</strong> Fine-tuning can improve the model’s ability to select and call the correct functions.</li>
<li><strong>Caution:</strong> When working with complex or lengthy function definitions, it might be necessary to include them in the prompt even after fine-tuning.
<ul>
<li>Unlike scenarios where fine-tuning can replace lengthy prompts, function calling might require those definitions to be present during runtime.</li>

<section id="reducing-hallucinations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reducing-hallucinations">Reducing Hallucinations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> The Q&amp;A model in OpenAI’s cookbook demonstrates how to reduce hallucinations.
<ul>
<li><strong>Approach:</strong> The model is trained on Olympic-related questions. If the question falls outside this domain, it’s designed to respond with “I don’t know.”</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Fine-tuning effectively minimizes false positives (incorrect answers) in this scenario.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="adoption-rate-of-fine-tuning-and-open-source-alternatives" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adoption-rate-of-fine-tuning-and-open-source-alternatives">Adoption Rate of Fine-tuning and Open Source Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observation:</strong> Less than 1% of OpenAI API users utilize fine-tuning.
<ul>
<li><strong>Reason:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fine-tuning is a more advanced technique used for optimization or when other methods are insufficient.</li>
<li>Many users find success with base models and simpler approaches.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> What are the advantages of fine-tuning OpenAI models compared to open-source models?
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantages of OpenAI models:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Access to state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 (for select partners).</li>
<li>Advanced features like tool calling, function calling, and the assistance API.</li>
<li>Simplified deployment and infrastructure management.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consider Open Source When:</strong>
<ul>
<li>OpenAI’s offerings don’t meet specific needs or violate terms of service.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Additional Insights:</strong>
<ul>
<li>OpenAI’s models, even GPT-3.5, often outperform open-source alternatives, especially for complex tasks and at scale.</li>
<li>OpenAI’s platform offers greater ease of use, especially with features like tool calling and handling API rate limits.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="moving-from-fine-tuning-to-newer-models" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="moving-from-fine-tuning-to-newer-models">Moving from Fine-tuning to Newer Models</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observation:</strong> The release of more powerful base models sometimes leads users to abandon fine-tuning in favor of the improved base models.</li>
<li><strong>Factors Influencing the Decision:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance Difference:</strong> If the new base model offers substantial improvement, switching might be preferable.</li>
<li><strong>Cost and Latency:</strong> If the performance difference is minimal, sticking with a fine-tuned 3.5 model might be more cost-effective and faster.</li>

<section id="sustainability-and-future-of-fine-tuning" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sustainability-and-future-of-fine-tuning">Sustainability and Future of Fine-tuning</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concern:</strong> Given Google’s history of discontinuing products, is there a risk of OpenAI doing the same with fine-tuning?</li>
<li><strong>Reassurance:</strong>
<ul>
<li>OpenAI is committed to supporting applications that are successful with fine-tuning.</li>
<li>The company recognizes the investment users make in data preparation and training, and aims to avoid disruption.</li>
<li><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> OpenAI understands the higher switching cost associated with fine-tuning and aims to provide continued support.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-ownership-and-licensing-for-fine-tuning">Data Ownership and Licensing for Fine-tuning</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> What happens to the data used for fine-tuning in terms of IP and licensing?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> OpenAI never uses customer data for training its foundation models. This is explicitly stated in their privacy policy and terms of service.</li>
<li><strong>Data Control:</strong> Users have complete control over their data’s lifecycle. They can delete it after fine-tuning or retain it for future models.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="language-model-agents-and-function-calling-internals">Language Model Agents and Function Calling Internals</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Are there any impressive examples of OpenAI being used to create successful language model agents?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Steven defers to another team specializing in agents and tool calling.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Interest:</strong> Steven finds the GitHub AI workspaces and their agent-like capabilities for coding tasks promising.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Is there tension between the abstraction provided by higher-level services (like the assistance API) and fine-tuning, especially regarding data access and transparency?
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fine-tuned models can be used within the assistance API.</li>
<li>The assistance API primarily aids in context management and tool access, not necessarily replacing fine-tuning.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Follow-up Question:</strong> If the assistance API modifies or truncates context, wouldn’t that impact fine-tuning?
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Steven acknowledges the potential issue but lacks specific details about the assistance API’s internal context handling.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Regarding function calling, is it true that JSON schema definitions are translated into a Hyperscript-like format before processing? Can users leverage this for simpler function definitions?
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Steven confirms that all inputs, including JSON schemas, are converted into OpenAI’s internal token format.</li>
<li>He can’t share specifics about the internal representation or translation process.</li>
<li><strong>General Direction:</strong> OpenAI aims to make the default function calling experience (using JSON schemas) the most effective, without requiring users to rely on workarounds or internal knowledge.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Embeddings</strong>: Supported through plugins, both API-based and local.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Viewing Available Embedding Models</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>llm embed models</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Creating Embeddings</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>llm embed -m &lt;model_name&gt; "&lt;text_to_embed&gt;"</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Storing Embeddings in SQLite</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>llm embed multi</code> Command</strong>: Creates a collection of embeddings and stores them in a SQLite database.</li>
<li>Example: Creating embeddings for bookmarks in a blog database:

<section id="scoring-difficulties" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scoring-difficulties">1. Scoring Difficulties</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Issue:</strong> Reliably evaluating the correctness of LLM responses in natural language.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subjectivity of Language:</strong> What constitutes a “correct” response can be subjective and context-dependent.</li>
<li><strong>Hallucination:</strong> LLMs can generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information, making it challenging to determine accuracy based on surface-level analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Standardized Metrics:</strong> Absence of universally agreed-upon metrics for evaluating LLM performance across different tasks and domains.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="reproducibility-issues" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reproducibility-issues">2. Reproducibility Issues</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Importance:</strong> Ensuring that evaluation results are consistent and replicable.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sensitivity to Implementation Details:</strong> LLM performance can vary significantly based on seemingly minor differences in implementation, such as tokenization, prompt formatting, and hyperparameters.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Transparency:</strong> Limited sharing of evaluation code and detailed methodologies makes it difficult for others to reproduce results.</li>
<li><strong>Data Set Variability:</strong> Differences in data set composition and quality can lead to inconsistent evaluations.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="log-likelihoods-assessing-the-probability-of-expected-outputs">1. Log Likelihoods: Assessing the Probability of Expected Outputs</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LLMs output a probability distribution over vocabulary for each possible next token.</li>
<li>This distribution represents the model’s confidence in different words following the given input.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Input:</strong> A prompt (X) and a potential output (Y).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Process:</strong> Calculate the probability of the model generating Y given X. This involves summing the log probabilities of each token in Y, conditioned on the preceding tokens in X and Y.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Clog%20P(y%7Cx)%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bi=0%7D%5E%7Bm-1%7D%20%5Clog%20p(y_i%20%7C%20x,%20y_0,%20%5Cldots,%20y_%7Bi-1%7D)%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bi=0%7D%5E%7Bm-1%7D%20l(n+i,%20y_%7Bi%7D)%0A"></p></li>
<li><p>where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clog%20p(y_i%20%7C%20x,%20y_0,%20%5Cldots,%20y_%7Bi-1%7D)"> is the log probability of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">-th target token conditioned on the full input <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> and the preceding target tokens. (and where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x,%20y_0,%20%5Cldots,%20y_%7Bi-1%7D"> denotes conditioning on only <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x">.).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Example:</strong> For the prompt “The cow jumped over the,” calculate the probability of the model generating “moon” versus other words.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Use Case: Multiple Choice Question Answering</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantages:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Computationally cheaper than generation-based evaluation.</li>
<li>Avoids issues with parsing errors in generated text.</li>
<li>Suitable for evaluating smaller LLMs or those in early training stages.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Limited real-world applicability compared to open-ended generation.</li>
<li>Doesn’t assess a model’s ability to formulate its own answers.</li>
<li>Cannot evaluate chain-of-thought reasoning.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Challenges with Log Likelihoods and Perplexity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tokenizer Sensitivity:</strong> Metrics are affected by the specific tokenizer used, making comparisons between models with different tokenizers difficult.
<ul>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> Implement normalization techniques to account for tokenizer variations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Limited Information:</strong> Log likelihoods only consider the probability of a given output, not its overall quality, coherence, or factual accuracy.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="perplexity-measuring-how-well-a-model-fits-a-data-distribution">2. Perplexity: Measuring How Well a Model Fits a Data Distribution</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Concept:</strong> Quantifies how well a language model predicts a given text, indicating its familiarity with the data distribution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Calculation:</strong> Based on the average per-token log probability of the text, with lower perplexity indicating a better fit to the data.</p>
<ul>

</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Evaluating a model’s understanding of a specific text corpus (e.g., Wikipedia).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain Specificity:</strong> Perplexity on one dataset (e.g., Wikipedia) may not generalize to other domains or tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Insight into Downstream Performance:</strong> A low perplexity doesn’t guarantee good performance in real-world applications like chatbots or question answering.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="text-generation-evaluating-real-world-output-but-facing-scoring-challenges">3. Text Generation: Evaluating Real-World Output but Facing Scoring Challenges</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Importance:</strong> Crucial for assessing LLMs in tasks involving text generation (e.g., chatbots, story writing).</li>
<li><strong>Challenges:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scoring Free-Form Text:</strong> Determining the correctness and quality of generated text is difficult.
<ul>
<li>Simple heuristics (e.g., keyword matching) are unreliable and prone to gaming.</li>
<li>Human evaluation is expensive and time-consuming.</li>
<li>LLM-based judges introduce their own biases and limitations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sensitivity to Prompt Details:</strong> Minor variations in prompts (e.g., trailing whitespace) can drastically impact results, hindering reproducibility.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> In code generation, a trailing tab in the prompt can create syntax errors for models that generate code with specific formatting, leading to artificially lower performance scores.</li>

<li><strong>Meaningful Progress Tracking:</strong> Tracking improvements in model development and evaluation methods.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenges to Reproducibility:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lack of standardized evaluation practices and metrics.</li>

<li>While the science of transistors was established, reliable manufacturing was a challenge.</li>
<li>Early transistors, using a <strong>mesa</strong> structure, were prone to impurities affecting their performance.</li>
<li><strong>Jean Ernie</strong>, Noyce’s colleague at Fairchild, developed a <strong>planar process</strong>:
<ul>
<li>This method involved building transistors into, rather than on top of, the germanium, and depositing a protective layer of silicon dioxide to prevent impurities.</li>
<li>Ernie’s innovation significantly improved transistor reliability.</li>

<li><strong>Noyce’s Refinement:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Noyce realized Ernie’s planar process could be used to create multiple transistors on a single piece of silicon.</li>
<li>Unlike Kilby’s integrated circuit, which used wires, Noyce’s design embedded the transistors and wires within the silicon, further reducing size and complexity.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Anatoly Trutko</strong>, a Soviet semiconductor engineer, arrived at Stanford University in 1959 as part of a student exchange program.
<ul>
<li>This was surprising given US fears of the USSR catching up in science and technology.</li>
<li>Trutko studied advanced technology, even attending lectures by <strong>William Shockley</strong>.
<ul>
<li>After one class, Trutko asked Shockley to sign his book, <em>Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors</em>.</li>
<li>Shockley complained to Trutko that the USSR refused to pay royalties for the book’s Russian translation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The USSR understood the value of semiconductors.
<ul>
<li>They translated Shockley’s textbook into Russian just two years after it was published.</li>
<li>US spies were ordered to acquire Soviet semiconductor devices as early as 1956 to assess their quality.
<ul>
<li>A 1959 CIA report found that America was only two to four years ahead of the Soviets in transistor quality and quantity.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>At least several early Soviet exchange students were later revealed to be KGB agents.
<ul>
<li>This highlights the link between student exchanges and Soviet defense industry goals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Both the Pentagon and the Kremlin understood that <strong>transistors</strong> and <strong>integrated circuits</strong> would revolutionize manufacturing, computing, and military power.
<ul>
<li>Starting in the late 1950s, the USSR established new semiconductor facilities and assigned top scientists to this industry.</li>

<li><strong>Joel Barr</strong> and <strong>Alfred Sarant</strong> were American electrical engineers who became Soviet spies.
<ul>
<li>They were childhood friends, both sons of Russian Jewish immigrants, and active in the Young Communist League.</li>
<li>They were recruited into a KGB espionage ring led by <strong>Julius Rosenberg</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>During the 1940s, Barr and Sarant worked on classified radar and military systems at leading American tech firms.

<ul>
<li>Taiwan in the late 1960s:
<ul>
<li>Economically successful, but politically isolated.</li>
<li>Faced a growing threat from mainland China, which had developed nuclear weapons.</li>
<li>The US, Taiwan’s main ally, was reducing its global commitments after the Vietnam War.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>K.T. Lee</strong> recognized the strategic opportunity presented by TI:
<ul>
<li>Attracting foreign investment could boost Taiwan’s economy and technological development.</li>
<li>Deepening economic ties with the US could enhance Taiwan’s security.</li>

<li>TI also saw advantages in Taiwan:
<ul>
<li>Low wages.</li>
<li>A government eager to attract foreign investment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chang, a native of mainland China, was initially hesitant about Taiwan but became convinced by former classmates.</li>
<li>Despite their initial clashes, Shepard and Lee smoothed over relations.</li>
<li>TI’s board approved the Taiwan facility in July 1968, and it began production in 1969.</li>

<li>By the early 1980s, US semiconductor firms employed tens of thousands of workers in Asia, mainly in Korea, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia.</li>
<li>This created a complex web of interdependence, with:
<ul>
<li>US firms relying on Asian labor and markets.</li>
<li>Asian countries benefiting from investment, technology transfer, and jobs.</li>
<li>The US strengthening its economic and strategic position in Asia.</li>

<ul>
<li>One of Intel’s first major products was the <strong>Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM)</strong> chip.</li>
<li>Before DRAM, computers stored data using <strong>magnetic cores</strong>, which were bulky and difficult to scale down.</li>
<li><strong>Robert Dennard</strong> at IBM developed the concept of DRAM:
<ul>
<li>Using a <strong>transistor</strong> and a <strong>capacitor</strong> to store a single bit of information.</li>
<li>Repeatedly charging the capacitor to maintain data storage (“dynamic”).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Intel’s DRAM chips were:
<ul>
<li>Smaller.</li>
<li>More reliable.</li>
<li>Cheaper to produce than magnetic cores.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chapter-21-the-potato-chip-king">Chapter 21: The Potato Chip King</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jack Simplot</strong>, an Idaho billionaire known for his potato empire, invested in <strong>Micron Technology</strong>, a struggling DRAM chip manufacturer.
<ul>
<li>Simplot’s expertise was in potatoes, evident from his “Mr.&nbsp;Spud” license plate, but he understood business in a way that Silicon Valley often didn’t.</li>
<li>Simplot made his fortune by pioneering potato processing techniques that led to a massive contract with McDonald’s.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Micron</strong>, founded in 1978 by brothers <strong>Joe and Ward Parkinson</strong>, entered the DRAM market during a time of intense Japanese dominance.
<ul>
<li>Existing American DRAM producers, including <strong>AMD, National Semiconductor</strong>, and <strong>Intel</strong>, were abandoning the market due to billion-dollar losses from Japanese competition.</li>
<li>Micron, initially focused on chip design, was forced to pivot to manufacturing their own chips after losing their only client, <strong>Mostek</strong>, to Japanese competitor <strong>Fujitsu</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Silicon Valley lobbied the government for protection against Japanese competition, claiming that computer chips were strategic assets unlike commodities like potatoes.</li>
<li>Micron, however, initially opposed government intervention, believing they could compete with the Japanese through aggressive cost-cutting.</li>
<li>Micron secured funding from <strong>Alan Noble</strong> and other Boise investors. Facing continued struggles, they approached <strong>Simplot</strong>, who saw an opportunity in the depressed DRAM market and invested $1 million, later increasing his stake to over a billion dollars.
<ul>
<li>Simplot believed that Japanese competition had turned DRAM into a commodity, and the best time to buy a commodity business was during a downturn.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Micron’s competitive edge stemmed from their relentless focus on cost reduction and innovative manufacturing processes.
<ul>
<li><strong>Ward Parkinson</strong>, Micron’s engineering lead, focused on shrinking the chip size to fit more chips onto each silicon wafer, increasing manufacturing efficiency.</li>
<li>Micron simplified manufacturing processes, using fewer steps and less equipment than competitors.</li>
<li>They modified existing lithography machines to exceed manufacturer specifications and adapted furnaces to process more wafers simultaneously.</li>
<li>Micron’s location in Boise offered lower land and electricity costs compared to California or Japan.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Joe Parkinson instilled a culture of cost-consciousness, dimming lights and emphasizing efficiency to employees. This “sweatshop mentality” was driven by the understanding that Micron’s survival was paramount in a place with limited alternative job opportunities.</li>
<li>Micron’s strategy ultimately succeeded.
<ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Andy Grove</strong>, Intel’s President, recognized that the company’s DRAM business was being disrupted by Japanese competition and needed a drastic change.
<ul>
<li>Grove was known for his “paranoid” management style, driven by a fear of competition and failure, which he outlined in his book, <strong>Only the Paranoid Survive</strong>.</li>
<li>Grove’s experiences as a Hungarian refugee escaping Soviet oppression shaped his leadership, emphasizing constant vigilance and a drive to overcome challenges.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite Intel’s history and identity being rooted in memory chips, Grove acknowledged that the DRAM market was no longer viable and a shift was necessary for survival.
<ul>
<li>The decision to abandon DRAM was difficult and emotionally charged for Intel, but Grove recognized the need to disrupt themselves before being overtaken by competitors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Grove initiated a painful restructuring process.
<ul>
<li><strong>Step One</strong>: Laying off over 25% of Intel’s workforce and closing facilities in Silicon Valley, Oregon, Puerto Rico, and Barbados.</li>
<li><strong>Step Two</strong>: Implementing a ruthless approach to improve manufacturing, inspired by Japanese methods.
<ul>
<li><strong>Craig Barrett</strong>, Grove’s deputy, led this effort, pushing for the adoption of rigorous processes.</li>
<li>Intel adopted a “<strong>copy exactly</strong>” manufacturing methodology, replicating the most efficient processes across all facilities to ensure consistency and high yields.</li>
<li>This shift from Silicon Valley’s freewheeling engineering culture to a more disciplined and standardized approach was met with internal resistance but ultimately proved successful in increasing efficiency and reducing costs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Several external factors contributed to Intel’s resurgence:
<ul>
<li>The rising value of the Japanese yen against the dollar made American exports cheaper.</li>
<li>Falling interest rates in the US lowered Intel’s capital costs.</li>
<li>The emergence of <strong>Compaq</strong> and other <strong>IBM PC clones</strong> created a new market for Intel’s microprocessors.</li>
<li>These “clone” manufacturers utilized Intel’s chips and Microsoft’s software, driving down PC prices and fueling mass adoption.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By transitioning from DRAM to microprocessors, Intel secured a near-monopoly in the burgeoning PC market, solidifying their position as a leading chip manufacturer.</li>

<li><strong>Lee Byung-chul</strong>, founder of <strong>Samsung</strong>, saw an opportunity in the semiconductor industry amidst the US-Japan DRAM wars.
<ul>
<li>Lee, a shrewd businessman who started by trading dried fish and vegetables, believed in building businesses that were “big, strong, and eternal”.</li>
<li>He recognized the potential of semiconductors after witnessing the success of Japanese companies like <strong>Toshiba</strong> and <strong>Fujitsu</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lee was inspired by <strong>Hewlett-Packard’s</strong> journey from a garage startup to a tech giant during a visit to California in 1982.
<ul>
<li>He was determined to replicate their success with Samsung.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite the high capital expenditure and risk involved, Lee decided to invest at least $100 million in semiconductor manufacturing, a move that could have jeopardized his entire business empire.</li>
<li><strong>Support from the South Korean government was crucial</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The government pledged $400 million to develop the country’s semiconductor industry and pressured banks to provide additional loans to companies like Samsung.</li>
<li>This mirrored the Japanese model of government-backed industrial policy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Silicon Valley, eager to undercut Japanese dominance, saw Korean companies as potential allies.
<ul>
<li><strong>Bob Noyce</strong> believed that Korean competition would prevent Japan from monopolizing DRAM production.</li>
<li>Intel and other Silicon Valley companies formed joint ventures with Samsung, providing them with manufacturing contracts and technology.</li>
<li>The logic was “my enemy’s enemy is my friend,” as <strong>Jerry Sanders</strong> stated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Factors that aided Samsung’s rise:
<ul>
<li>US-imposed tariffs on Japanese DRAM chips created an opening for Korean companies.</li>
<li>Lower wages and production costs in South Korea compared to Japan.</li>
<li>Access to US technology through licensing agreements, such as the deal for a 64K DRAM design from <strong>Micron</strong>.</li>

<ul>
<li>By the 1980s, the limitations of manual chip design were becoming apparent as transistor counts increased.
<ul>
<li>Early microprocessors, like Intel’s 4004, were designed by hand, a time-consuming and error-prone process.</li>
<li><strong>Federico Fagan’s</strong> experience designing Intel’s first microprocessor in 1971 highlighted the challenges: he spent six months meticulously drawing the design, which was then transferred to rubylith film and used to create masks for photolithography.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Carver Mead</strong> and <strong>Lynn Conway</strong> revolutionized chip design by introducing a standardized, algorithmic approach.
<ul>
<li><strong>Carver Mead</strong>, a physicist, and <strong>Lynn Conway</strong>, a computer architect at <strong>Xerox PARC</strong>, collaborated to create a set of mathematical design rules that enabled software to automate the chip design process.</li>
<li>Their methodology allowed designers to use a library of pre-designed components instead of drawing every transistor individually. This “<strong>Mead-Conway revolution</strong>” mirrored <strong>Gutenberg’s</strong> invention of the printing press, simplifying chip design and making it more accessible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)</strong> recognized the strategic importance of the Mead-Conway approach and funded initiatives to promote its adoption.
<ul>
<li>They financed programs for university researchers to design and fabricate chips at advanced facilities, fostering a new generation of chip designers.</li>
<li>DARPA’s focus was on building educational infrastructure and supporting research that would maintain America’s lead in microelectronics, recognizing the crucial role of innovation in national security.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <strong>Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC)</strong>, funded by the chip industry, also played a critical role by distributing research grants to universities.
<ul>
<li>Universities like <strong>Carnegie Mellon</strong> and the <strong>University of California, Berkeley</strong> became hubs for semiconductor research, producing graduates who went on to found companies that developed essential software tools for chip design.</li>
<li>These DARPA and SRC-funded programs nurtured an ecosystem of innovation that led to the creation of companies like <strong>Synopsys, Cadence</strong>, and <strong>Mentor Graphics</strong>, which continue to dominate the chip design software industry today.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Erwin Jacobs</strong>, a pioneer in wireless communication, envisioned using increasingly powerful chips to revolutionize data transmission.
<ul>
<li>Jacobs, who co-founded <strong>Qualcomm</strong>, realized that as transistor density increased, chips would be able to encode and decode significantly more data within the limited bandwidth of radio waves.</li>
<li>He predicted that this would lead to a future where large amounts of data could be transmitted wirelessly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DARPA funding was instrumental in Qualcomm’s early success, supporting the development of space communication systems before the company shifted focus to the civilian market.</li>
<li>Jacobs’ story highlights the importance of government funding in supporting early-stage research and development, particularly in capital-intensive fields like semiconductors.</li>
<li>By the end of the 1980s, thanks to these advancements in chip design, manufacturing, and applications, the unthinkable had become reality: Intel released its 486 microprocessor, containing 1.2 million transistors, a testament to the relentless pace of innovation driven by Silicon Valley and its government and academic partners.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Soviet Union, lagging behind the West in semiconductor technology, relied heavily on espionage to acquire Western chips and manufacturing equipment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Directorate T</strong>, a specialized KGB division established in 1963, was tasked with stealing foreign technology to bolster the Soviet semiconductor industry.</li>
<li>The KGB employed various tactics, including:
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct theft:</strong> Stealing physical chips from companies.</li>
<li><strong>Black market purchases:</strong> Acquiring chips through intermediaries and smugglers.</li>
<li><strong>Blackmail:</strong> Targeting Westerners with access to sensitive technology.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Soviet espionage efforts were extensive:
<ul>
<li>The KGB reportedly had a team of 60 agents in San Francisco focused on infiltrating Silicon Valley companies.</li>
<li>The discovery of a sophisticated Soviet listening device using <strong>Texas Instruments</strong> chips disguised as a buoy in 1982 highlighted the reach and sophistication of their operations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The limitations of the “<strong>copy-it</strong>” strategy:
<ul>
<li>While stealing samples or even shipments of chips was relatively straightforward, replicating the complex manufacturing processes was a significant challenge.</li>
<li>As chip complexity increased, the Soviets struggled to produce high-quality copies, rendering their stolen technology less valuable.</li>
<li>This over-reliance on theft hindered the development of indigenous Soviet semiconductor expertise.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Vladimir Vetrov (codename: Farewell):</strong> A disillusioned KGB agent who became a double agent for France.
<ul>
<li>Vetrov, dissatisfied with his career and personal life, leaked thousands of pages of classified documents about Directorate T’s operations to French intelligence, revealing the vast scale of Soviet technology theft.</li>
<li>He was motivated by a desire for a more exciting life and hoped to rekindle a romantic relationship.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Operation Exodus</strong>: A US-led initiative to counter Soviet technology theft, launched in response to Vetrov’s revelations.
<ul>
<li>The program implemented stricter export controls, increased customs inspections, and targeted Soviet acquisition networks.</li>
<li>By 1985, Operation Exodus had seized $600 million worth of goods and led to numerous arrests.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite the KGB’s efforts, the Soviet Union remained technologically inferior to the West in microelectronics.
<ul>
<li>By the mid-1980s, Soviet microprocessors were estimated to be half a decade behind their American counterparts.</li>
<li>The reliance on the copy-it strategy ultimately proved detrimental, hindering innovation and perpetuating dependence on foreign technology.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov</strong>, chief of the Soviet military, recognized the transformative impact of microelectronics on warfare, predicting that precision-guided weapons would turn conventional explosives into “<strong>weapons of mass destruction</strong>.”</li>
<li>Ogarkov argued that the Soviet Union’s numerical superiority in tanks and troops was becoming increasingly irrelevant in the face of America’s superior precision-guided weapons and surveillance technology.
<ul>
<li>He recognized that <strong>Bill Perry’s offset strategy</strong> of leveraging technology to counter Soviet numerical superiority was succeeding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact of the semiconductor gap on Soviet military capabilities</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Missile technology</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Soviet ballistic missiles were less accurate than their American counterparts due to the limitations of their onboard computers and guidance systems.</li>
<li>The US <strong>MX missile</strong> was estimated to be significantly more accurate than the Soviet <strong>SS-25</strong>, giving the US a strategic advantage in a potential nuclear conflict.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Anti-submarine warfare</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The US Navy’s use of advanced computers, like the <strong>ILLIAC-4</strong>, for analyzing sonar data significantly enhanced their ability to detect and track Soviet submarines.</li>
</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenges faced by the Soviet semiconductor industry</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Political interference</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The KGB’s influence within the industry hindered efficiency and innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Yuri OShokhin’s</strong> removal from the <strong>Riga semiconductor plant</strong> for refusing to dismiss employees targeted by the KGB exemplified this problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lack of a robust consumer market</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The absence of a large civilian market for electronics limited the growth and innovation of the Soviet semiconductor industry.</li>
<li>This contrasted with the US, Europe, and Japan, where booming consumer markets drove demand for advanced chips.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Limited international collaboration</strong>:

<li>The 1990s marked a period of decline for the Japanese semiconductor industry and the rise of American dominance.
<ul>
<li>Japan’s economic bubble burst in 1990, leading to a prolonged recession and exposing the weaknesses of its over-investment in certain industries, including semiconductors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Factors contributing to Japan’s semiconductor decline</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Overinvestment and lack of profitability</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Japanese chipmakers, fueled by easy access to capital, continued investing heavily in DRAM production despite declining prices and competition from lower-cost producers like <strong>Micron</strong> and <strong>Samsung</strong>.</li>
<li>This overcapacity led to a DRAM glut and falling profits.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Missed opportunities in new markets</strong>:

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-foundry-model-a-radical-idea">The Foundry Model: A Radical Idea</h4>
<ul>
<li>Chang proposed a radical business model—a <strong>“foundry”—</strong>to propel Taiwan’s semiconductor industry forward.
<ul>
<li>This model involved manufacturing chips designed by other companies rather than designing and producing chips in-house, which was the prevailing industry model at the time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chang had first pitched this idea while at TI in 1976, predicting the rise of <strong>“fabless”</strong> companies that focused solely on chip design.
<ul>
<li>However, TI executives rejected the proposal, deeming it too risky to invest in markets that didn’t yet exist.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The concept gained traction due to several factors:
<ul>
<li><strong>Lynn Conway and Carver Mead’s work:</strong> Their revolution in chip design, which simplified the separation of design and manufacturing, made Chang’s foundry model more feasible.</li>
<li><strong>Growing demand:</strong> Chang anticipated that the decreasing cost of computing power would drive demand for semiconductors in a wide range of new applications, creating opportunities for specialized manufacturers.</li>
<li><strong>Rising manufacturing costs:</strong> As transistors shrank and technology advanced, the cost of manufacturing equipment and R&amp;D became increasingly prohibitive for companies producing smaller volumes of chips.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="richard-chang-and-semiconductor-manufacturing-in-china">Richard Chang and Semiconductor Manufacturing in China</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Richard Chang</strong>, a devout Christian and semiconductor engineer, aimed to bring advanced chip-making to China.
<ul>
<li>Born in Nanjing in 1948, his family fled to Taiwan when he was one year old after the Communist takeover.</li>
<li>Earned a graduate degree in Buffalo, New York, and worked at Texas Instruments, gaining expertise in operating fabs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In 2000, Chang founded <strong>Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC)</strong> in Shanghai.
<ul>
<li>Secured over $1.5 billion from international investors, with an estimated half coming from U.S. investors.</li>
<li>Hired hundreds of foreign experts, including at least 400 from Taiwan, to operate SMIC’s fab.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chang’s strategy mirrored TSMC’s successful approach in Taiwan:
<ul>
<li>Recruit the best engineers with experience at advanced chip firms.</li>
<li>Invest in the best equipment.</li>
<li>Prioritize employee training in industry best practices.</li>
<li>Leverage government tax and subsidy benefits.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>SMIC’s aggressive hiring strategy:
<ul>
<li>Focused on recruiting experienced engineers from overseas chipmakers, primarily Taiwan.</li>
<li><strong>“One Old Staffer Brings Along Two New Ones”</strong>: A company slogan emphasizing the need for experienced foreign-trained employees to train local engineers.</li>
<li>Foreign-trained workforce proved crucial for SMIC’s success in domesticating technology.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Workforce Composition (Doug Fuller’s analysis):
<ul>
<li>In 2001: 650 local engineers and 393 recruited from overseas (mostly Taiwan and the U.S.).</li>
<li>Throughout the 2000s: Approximately one-third of engineering employees were hired from abroad.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>SMIC’s Successes:
<ul>
<li>Benefited from significant government support (five-year corporate tax holiday, reduced sales tax on chips sold in China).</li>
<li>Focused on manufacturing quality and adopting near cutting-edge technology.</li>
<li>Secured contracts to build chips for industry leaders like Texas Instruments.</li>
<li>Listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange in 2004.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By the late 2000s, SMIC was only a couple of years behind the world’s technology leaders, on track to potentially rival TSMC.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lithography</strong> - A process using light to carve circuits onto silicon wafers.</li>
<li>As transistors shrunk due to <strong>Moore’s Law</strong>, traditional lithography methods faced limitations.

<ul>
<li><strong>Context:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The US emerged from the Cold War as a global superpower.</li>
<li>Globalization and interconnectedness were seen as inevitable and positive.</li>
<li>Intel dominated the microprocessor market.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Intel’s Consortium:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>1996</strong>: Intel partnered with US Department of Energy labs (e.g., Lawrence Livermore, Sandia) to advance EUV.</li>
<li>Goal: Transition EUV from scientific research to mass production.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Choosing ASML:</strong>
<ul>
<li>US firms (GCA defunct, SVG lagging) couldn’t commercialize EUV.</li>
<li>Government opposed Japanese involvement (Nikon, Canon) due to past trade tensions.</li>
<li>ASML, despite being foreign, became the only viable option.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Concerns and Justifications:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Government Concerns:</strong> Giving a foreign company access to sensitive national lab research raised concerns about future access to critical technology.</li>
<li><strong>Counterarguments:</strong>
<ul>
<li>No immediate military application for EUV.</li>
<li>EUV’s success was not guaranteed.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>ASML’s Monopoly:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nikon and Canon, excluded from US research, abandoned EUV development.</li>
<li><strong>2001</strong>: ASML acquired SVG (US’s last major lithography firm).
<ul>
<li><strong>Concerns:</strong> Further consolidated EUV technology under ASML.</li>
<li><strong>Justifications:</strong>

<li>Necessary for EUV progress and the future of computing (argued by Intel CEO Craig Barrett).</li>
<li>Aligned with the Bush administration’s policy of promoting globalization and loosening export controls.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Outcome:</strong>
<ul>
<li>EUV development continued with ASML as the sole supplier.</li>

<ul>
<li>The semiconductor industry can be split into three categories:
<ul>
<li><strong>Logic:</strong> Processors for smartphones, computers, and servers. Driven by Moore’s Law, requiring smaller transistors for better performance.</li>
<li><strong>Memory:</strong> DRAM (short-term memory) and Flash/NAND (long-term memory). Also driven by Moore’s Law and the need to shrink transistors.</li>
<li><strong>Other:</strong> Includes analog chips (sensors, RF chips, power management). Less dependent on Moore’s Law, with design being more important than shrinking transistors.
<ul>
<li>75% of these chips are produced using older, cheaper 180nm technology (from the late 1990s).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>EUV light source:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Developed by <strong>CYMER</strong>, acquired by ASML.</li>
<li>Involves blasting tiny tin droplets with a powerful laser 50,000 times per second to generate EUV light.</li>
<li>Requires lasers with unprecedented power and precision, developed by the German company <strong>TRUMPF</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>EUV mirrors:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Developed by the German company <strong>ZEISS</strong>.</li>
<li>Made of alternating layers of molybdenum and silicon, each a few nanometers thick.</li>
<li>Designed to reflect EUV light, which is easily absorbed by most materials.</li>
<li>Requires extreme precision and smoothness; irregularities are measured in fractions of a nanometer.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Arm, a British company acquired by SoftBank (a Japanese firm heavily invested in Chinese tech), designed chip architecture.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Deal:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In 2018, Arm spun off its China division, selling 51% to Chinese investors.</li>
<li>SoftBank, facing U.S. scrutiny over its China exposure, sold the stake for $775 million, a fraction of Arm’s $40 billion acquisition cost.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rationale:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Arm executives acknowledged China’s desire for control over technology, particularly for sensitive applications like military and surveillance.</li>
<li>The spin-off allowed Arm to access the Chinese market while complying with China’s demand for domestic control.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lack of Scrutiny:</strong>

<li><strong>Early Life:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Zhao’s family ended up in rural China after his father was exiled during the Cultural Revolution for writing subversive poetry.</li>
<li>Despite growing up raising livestock, Zhao aspired for more than a rural life.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Education and Early Career:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Zhao gained admission to Tsinghua University, one of China’s top institutions, where he studied electrical engineering.
<ul>
<li>Note: Tsinghua University has been at the forefront of China’s semiconductor efforts since the industry’s beginnings in the country.</li>
<li>It’s unclear how much semiconductor-specific knowledge Zhao acquired during his studies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>After graduating, he worked at a tech company before transitioning into investing as a vice president at Tsinghua Uni Group.
<ul>
<li><strong>Tsinghua Uni Group:</strong> Established by Tsinghua University to commercialize its research, the company seemingly focused heavily on real estate investments.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Investment Success:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Zhao earned a reputation for skillful corporate deal-making, setting him on a path to substantial wealth.</li>
<li><strong>2004:</strong> Zhao founded his own investment firm, Beijing Jiankun Group.
<ul>
<li><strong>Investment Focus:</strong> Real estate, mining, and other sectors where political connections are often critical for success.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>2009:</strong> Zhao acquired a 49% stake in his former employer, Tsinghua Uni Group, with the university retaining the remaining 51%.
<ul>
<li><strong>Unusual Transaction:</strong> This raised eyebrows as it meant a private real estate investment firm now held significant control over a company meant to commercialize technology from a leading research university.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tsinghua Unigroup’s Political Connections:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The company wasn’t a typical business entity. It had strong ties to the Chinese Communist Party:
<ul>
<li>The son of former Chinese President Hu Jintao, reportedly a personal friend of Zhao’s, held the position of Communist Party Secretary for the holding company that owned Unigroup.</li>
<li>The president of Tsinghua University during the 2000s was a former college roommate of Xi Jinping.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>2013:</strong> Zhao shifted focus to the chip industry, a move that coincided with the Chinese Communist Party’s announcement of major subsidies for domestic semiconductor companies.
<ul>
<li><strong>Zhao’s Claim:</strong> He denies that Tsinghua Unigroup’s semiconductor strategy was a reaction to the government’s plans, stating, “Everyone thinks that the government is pushing the development of the chip sector, but it’s not like that” (Forbes, 2015).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Spreadtrum Communications</strong></li>
<li><strong>RDA Microelectronics</strong></li>
<li>Both companies specialized in low-end chips for smartphones.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Zhao’s Justification:</strong> He predicted significant “synergies” from the merger, both domestically and internationally.
<ul>
<li>Note: Almost a decade later, there’s little evidence to support these claims of synergy.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>2014:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intel Partnership:</strong> Tsinghua Unigroup partnered with Intel to combine Intel’s wireless modem chips with their smartphone processors.
<ul>
<li><strong>Intel’s Goal:</strong> To expand its presence in the Chinese smartphone market.</li>
<li><strong>Zhao’s Goal:</strong> For his companies to gain knowledge from Intel’s chip design expertise.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Background:</strong> Tsinghua Unigroup offered to finance XMC (later acquired by YMTC), a Chinese company aiming to enter the NAND memory chip market.</li>
<li><strong>Excessive Investment:</strong> The XMC CEO admitted publicly that while he initially requested $15 billion for a new fabrication plant (“fab”), he was given $24 billion with the reasoning that “if they were going to be serious about being a world leader, then they needed to match the world leader’s investment.”
<ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ambitious Goals:</strong> Zhao’s ambitions extended beyond controlling China’s fabless chip companies or attracting foreign investment into China. He set his sights on dominating the global semiconductor industry.</li>
<li><strong>Recruiting Taiwanese Talent:</strong> He hired several prominent Taiwanese semiconductor executives, including the former CEO of UMC, Taiwan’s second-largest foundry.</li>
<li><strong>2015 Taiwan Visit:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Zhao traveled to Taiwan to advocate for lifting restrictions on Chinese investment in areas like chip design and fabrication.</li>
<li>He successfully acquired a 25% stake in Powertech Technology, a Taiwanese semiconductor assembler and tester, which was permissible under existing regulations.</li>
<li>He pursued stakes and joint ventures with other major Taiwanese chip assemblers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Targeting MediaTek and TSMC:</strong> Zhao’s true targets were Taiwan’s industry giants:
<ul>
<li><strong>MediaTek:</strong> The world’s leading chip designer outside of the United States.</li>
<li><strong>TSMC:</strong> The dominant foundry upon which nearly all global fabless chip companies relied.</li>
<li><strong>Proposed Acquisitions:</strong> He suggested buying a 25% stake in TSMC and merging MediaTek with Tsinghua Unigroup’s chip design operations.
<ul>
<li>These proposals were not legally permitted under Taiwan’s foreign investment laws.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pressure Tactics:</strong> Upon returning from Taiwan, Zhao publicly suggested at a Beijing conference that China should ban imports of Taiwanese chips if Taiwan didn’t ease its investment restrictions.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on TSMC and MediaTek:</strong> This pressure campaign put both companies in a difficult position due to their heavy reliance on the Chinese market.
<ul>
<li>Most of TSMC’s chips were used in electronics assembled in China.</li>
<li>The prospect of selling Taiwan’s key technology companies to a state-backed Chinese investor raised serious concerns about Taiwan’s economic independence.</li>

<li><strong>Morris Chang (TSMC):</strong> He expressed conditional openness to the deal, stating, “if the price is right and if it is beneficial to shareholders.” However, he also cautioned, “if Chinese investors could appoint members to Taiwanese companies’ boards of directors, it will not be that easy to protect intellectual property.”</li>
<li><strong>MediaTek:</strong> The company indicated support for collaboration “to join hands and raise the status and competitiveness of the Chinese and Taiwanese enterprises in the global chip industry,” but only if the Taiwanese government permitted it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Taiwanese Government’s Position:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>John Deng (Taiwan’s Economy Minister):</strong> He suggested loosening restrictions on Chinese investment in Taiwan’s chip sector.</li>
<li><strong>Deng’s View:</strong> He believed that increased Chinese influence in Taiwan’s chip industry was unavoidable, stating, “You cannot escape from this issue.”</li>

<li><strong>Micron’s Rejection:</strong> The company declined the offer, citing concerns about US government security reviews and deeming the deal unrealistic.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>September 2015: Another Failed Attempt:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tsinghua Unigroup offered $3.7 billion for a 15% stake in another US NAND memory chip company (name not specified in the text).</li>
<li><strong>CFIUS Rejection:</strong> The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews foreign investments for national security risks, blocked the deal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Spring 2016: Lattice Semiconductor Investment:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tsinghua Unigroup quietly acquired a 6% stake in Lattice Semiconductor, another US chip company.</li>
<li><strong>Zhao’s Claim:</strong> He insisted to the Wall Street Journal that this was “purely a financial investment,” adding, “We don’t have any intention at all to try to acquire Lattice.”</li>
<li><strong>Quick Sale:</strong> Within weeks, Tsinghua Unigroup began selling its Lattice shares.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Canyon Bridge and Imagination Technologies:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lattice Semiconductor Buyout Attempt:</strong> A California-based investment firm called Canyon Bridge, later revealed to be secretly funded by the Chinese government, made a bid to buy Lattice Semiconductor. This deal was also rejected by the US government.</li>
<li><strong>Imagination Technologies Acquisition:</strong> Canyon Bridge simultaneously purchased Imagination Technologies, a struggling UK-based chip designer. The deal was structured to exclude Imagination’s US assets to avoid US regulatory scrutiny.

<li><strong>Canyon Bridge Insider Trading Case:</strong>
<ul>
<li>During the attempted Lattice Semiconductor purchase, a Canyon Bridge co-founder was found guilty of insider trading for sharing confidential deal information with a contact in Beijing via WeChat and meetings at a Starbucks in Beijing. This contact then used the information to profit from stock purchases.</li>

<li><strong>Zhao’s Perspective:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business-Focused:</strong> Zhao maintained that he was simply a dedicated entrepreneur, claiming that mergers between large US and Chinese companies were inevitable.</li>
<li><strong>Zhao’s View:</strong> He believed such deals “should be viewed from a business perspective instead of being treated under nationalist or political contexts.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Government-Led Effort:</strong> However, the sheer volume of Chinese state-owned and state-financed private equity firms pursuing global semiconductor companies pointed to a coordinated government-led strategy to gain control of these companies.</li>
<li><strong>Following Directives:</strong> Xi Jinping had publicly called for an “assault” in the semiconductor sector. Tsinghua Unigroup’s actions, along with those of other government-backed investment vehicles, seemed to be a direct response to this directive.</li>

<li><strong>Overcoming Technological Hurdles</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Despite anticipated limitations, the industry has consistently overcome obstacles. The development and widespread use of <strong>3D FinFET transistors</strong> exemplify this ability to innovate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exceeding Expectations</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Carver Mead</strong>, the originator of the term “Moore’s Law,” once astounded experts with his prediction of chips containing <strong>100 million transistors per square centimeter</strong>.</li>
<li>Modern fabs can now pack hundreds of times more transistors onto a chip than Mead envisioned.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Jim Keller’s Optimistic Outlook</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Renowned chip designer <strong>Jim Keller</strong> envisions a 50-fold increase in transistor density:
<ul>
<li><strong>Thinner fin-shaped transistors</strong> could allow for a threefold increase in density.</li>
<li><strong>Tube-shaped gate-all-around transistors</strong> could double density by enabling electric field application from all directions.</li>
<li><strong>Stacking these wires</strong> could further increase density eightfold.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="playing-a-losing-game">Playing a Losing Game</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>This book argues that the U.S. military is on a path to lose a future war against China, and that this trajectory must be changed.</p></li>
<li><p>The author, Christian Brose, draws on his extensive experience as a national security and military advisor, most notably serving as staff director for Senator John McCain on the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p></li>
<li><p>This role provided Brose with access to classified information, top defense officials, and insights into the concerning reality of the U.S. military’s eroding advantage over China.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="a-stark-warning-ignored" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-stark-warning-ignored">A Stark Warning Ignored</h4>
<ul>
<li>In 2017, Brose witnessed Senator McCain’s attempt to warn his Senate colleagues about the U.S. military’s vulnerabilities against China.
<ul>
<li>McCain, troubled by the military’s lagging technological advancement, organized a classified briefing for all 100 senators.</li>
<li>The briefing, based on concerning war game simulations, revealed a bleak outlook: the U.S. consistently lost in simulated conflicts with China.</li>
<li>Despite the gravity of the situation, only a dozen senators attended.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>David Ochmanek</strong>, a former Pentagon official, has conducted extensive war game simulations for the Department of Defense, revealing a disturbing pattern:
<ul>
<li><strong>War Game Outcomes:</strong> The U.S. military consistently loses against China and Russia in these simulations, suffering heavy casualties and equipment losses while failing to achieve objectives.</li>
<li><strong>A Shocking Reality:</strong> This finding contradicts the prevailing assumption of U.S. military dominance, leaving many within the defense establishment in disbelief.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>A Consistent Pattern of Defeat:</strong> War game simulations over the past decade consistently show the U.S. losing against China.
<ul>
<li><strong>A Well-Kept Secret:</strong> This information remains largely unknown to the American public and even many members of Congress, despite being acknowledged within the Department of Defense.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-conversation-with-senator-mccain-imagining-a-war-with-china">A Conversation with Senator McCain: Imagining a War with China</h4>
<ul>
<li>Following the poorly attended Senate briefing, Brose and Senator McCain engaged in a sobering thought experiment: imagining a potential war with China.
<ul>
<li>They agreed that the U.S. would not instigate a conflict, but acknowledged potential triggers such as:
<ul>
<li>A maritime incident escalating into conflict.</li>
<li>A Chinese attack on a U.S. ally prompting American intervention.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>They envisioned a scenario where the U.S. would face significant challenges in mobilizing and deploying forces.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="a-potential-war-with-china-key-vulnerabilities-and-challenges" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-potential-war-with-china-key-vulnerabilities-and-challenges">A Potential War With China: Key Vulnerabilities and Challenges</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geographical Disadvantages and Logistical Nightmares:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Much of the U.S. military’s necessary equipment and personnel would be positioned thousands of miles away from the conflict zone.</li>
<li>Mobilization efforts would be hampered by cyberattacks and attacks on vulnerable supply lines, including cargo ships and aircraft.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Space and Cyber Warfare Dominance by China:</strong>
<ul>
<li>China would leverage its capabilities to target U.S. satellites, disrupting critical intelligence, communication, and GPS systems.</li>
<li>Command and control networks would be crippled by electronic, cyber, and missile attacks, leaving U.S. forces in disarray.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability of Forward Bases and Critical Infrastructure:</strong>
<ul>
<li>U.S. bases in Japan and Guam would be overwhelmed by barrages of Chinese ballistic and cruise missiles.</li>
<li>China’s hypersonic weapons, capable of maneuvering at high speeds, would render existing U.S. defenses useless.</li>
<li>Runways, operation centers, and fuel depots would be targeted, crippling U.S. operations and forcing evacuations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Air and Sea Power:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Older, non-stealthy fighter jets (F-15s, F-16s, F-18s) would be ineffective against China’s advanced air defenses.</li>
<li>Limited numbers of stealthy fighter jets (F-22s, F-35s) would be hampered by their short range and dependence on vulnerable aerial refueling tankers.</li>
<li>U.S. aircraft carriers would be forced to operate far from Chinese shores to avoid anti-ship missiles, limiting their effectiveness and making them vulnerable to attack.</li>
<li>China’s “carrier killer” missiles (DF-21 and DF-26) would pose a significant threat, potentially sinking carriers and causing massive casualties.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenges for the Marine Corps and Amphibious Operations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Marine Corps’ amphibious assault capabilities, designed for beach landings, would be largely ineffective against heavily defended Chinese territory.</li>
<li>The need to operate within range of Chinese missiles would severely restrict their ability to conduct traditional amphibious operations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Logistical Constraints and Depletion of Critical Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Key U.S. assets (submarines, long-range bombers, ground-launched missiles) would need to be relocated to the Pacific, taking crucial time.</li>
<li>Years of underinvestment and acquisition delays would result in a shortage of these assets and a rapid depletion of essential weapons.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section id="a-sobering-realization-facing-the-consequences" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-sobering-realization-facing-the-consequences">A Sobering Realization: Facing the Consequences</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Devastation and Defeat:</strong> Brose and McCain contemplated the potential human and material costs of such a war, including thousands of American casualties, sunken ships, destroyed bases, and a swift defeat.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unthinkable Choices:</strong> The potential for such a rapid and devastating loss would present a U.S. president with limited options, potentially including surrender or a futile fight.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>China’s Strategic Advantage:</strong> This outcome would fulfill China’s strategic objective of achieving victory without engaging in protracted warfare, as outlined in Sun Tzu’s “The Art of War.”</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-legacy-of-neglect-failing-to-address-the-challenge">A Legacy of Neglect: Failing to Address the Challenge</h4>
<ul>
<li>McCain expressed frustration and disappointment that despite past warnings and efforts to address military weaknesses, the U.S. found itself in a precarious position.
<ul>
<li>The 1980s revelation of a “hollow force” sparked outrage and action, yet the current crisis, despite being more dire, had not elicited a similar response.</li>
<li>McCain lamented the lack of awareness and urgency among both the public and elected officials, fearing future generations would judge them harshly for their inaction.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-illusion-of-american-military-supremacy-mistaking-inputs-for-outcomes">The Illusion of American Military Supremacy: Mistaking Inputs for Outcomes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Despite spending more on defense than any other country, the U.S. military faces an existential crisis, challenging the prevailing notion of its invincibility.
<ul>
<li>This discrepancy between spending and effectiveness highlights a fundamental flaw in how the U.S. approaches national defense.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Problem with Platforms:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. military’s traditional focus on platforms (e.g., ships, planes, tanks) as the primary measure of strength is misguided.</li>
<li>Platforms are seen as tangible symbols of military might, influencing budgets, capabilities, and even institutional identity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Importance of the Kill Chain:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defining the Kill Chain:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The kill chain is the essential process by which militaries achieve their objectives, involving three key steps:
<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding:</strong> Gathering information about the battlespace and the enemy.</li>
<li><strong>Deciding:</strong> Analyzing information and making strategic and tactical decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Acting:</strong> Executing decisions to achieve desired effects, which may or may not involve lethal force.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Closing and Breaking the Kill Chain:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Closing the Kill Chain:</strong> Successfully completing the understand-decide-act cycle to achieve a military objective.</li>
<li><strong>Breaking the Kill Chain:</strong> Disrupting an adversary’s ability to complete the kill chain, neutralizing their effectiveness.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>A Universal Concept:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The kill chain is not unique to the military; it mirrors processes used in business, sports, and everyday life.</li>
<li>This framework highlights that while the military operates in a unique and high-stakes environment, its core functions are relatable and understandable.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Information Revolution and Its Unfulfilled Promise:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The information revolution of the 1980s promised to revolutionize warfare by enabling networked warfare and the disaggregation of the kill chain across multiple platforms.</li>
<li>However, the U.S. defense establishment failed to fully embrace this transformation, clinging to its platform-centric approach.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Failure to Adapt:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Despite advancements in information technology, the U.S. military’s kill chain remains slow, inflexible, and reliant on outdated systems.</li>
<li>Military platforms often lack interoperability, hindering their ability to share information and function as a cohesive network.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Legacy of Failed Modernization:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Previous attempts to modernize the military often focused on developing better versions of existing platforms using unproven technologies, resulting in costly procurement failures.</li>
<li>The U.S. military’s current predicament is partly a result of learning the wrong lessons from these failures, leading to risk aversion and a reluctance to embrace truly transformative change.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section id="the-china-challenge-a-new-era-of-competition" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-china-challenge-a-new-era-of-competition">The China Challenge: A New Era of Competition</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Rapidly Evolving Threat:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The information revolution is accelerating, driven by commercial technology companies, and these advancements have significant military applications.</li>
<li>China, capitalizing on these emerging technologies, poses a rapidly growing and evolving threat to U.S. military dominance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>China’s Strategic Approach:</strong>
<ul>
<li>China has meticulously studied the U.S. military, identifying its weaknesses and developing strategies to exploit them.</li>
<li>Instead of directly confronting U.S. strengths, China aims to deny the U.S. military the ability to project power and fight in its preferred manner.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Asymmetric Warfare and Technological Leapfrogging:</strong>
<ul>
<li>China has invested heavily in advanced weapons designed to disrupt U.S. battle networks, destroy expensive platforms, and break the kill chain.</li>
<li>This approach prioritizes achieving a decisive advantage through technological superiority and asymmetric capabilities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Rise of China: Economic and Military Power:</strong>
<ul>
<li>China’s economic growth fuels its military ambitions, potentially enabling it to match or surpass U.S. military spending within a decade.</li>
<li>This shift in the balance of power poses an unprecedented challenge, demanding a fundamental reassessment of U.S. defense strategy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>China’s Grand Strategy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>China’s ambitions extend beyond regional dominance to becoming the world’s leading power, supplanting the United States.</li>
<li>This strategy entails undermining U.S. influence globally, eroding its alliances, and promoting China’s model of authoritarianism.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exploiting Emerging Technologies:</strong>
<ul>
<li>China recognizes the transformative potential of emerging technologies and is investing heavily in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, robotics, and other fields.</li>
<li>These technologies are not only being used to enhance its military but also to strengthen its authoritarian control domestically.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>A Looming Crisis for the U.S. Military:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. military’s current trajectory puts it at a severe disadvantage against China’s asymmetric capabilities.</li>
<li>Continuing to invest in the same platforms and approaches will only exacerbate this vulnerability, playing into China’s hands.</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-need-for-transformation-reimagining-american-military-power">The Need for Transformation: Reimagining American Military Power</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recognizing the Urgency:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. defense establishment must acknowledge the severity of the situation and the need for radical change.</li>
<li>Complacency and clinging to outdated paradigms will result in catastrophic consequences for U.S. security and global standing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shifting from Inputs to Outcomes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The focus should shift from simply acquiring platforms to building a more effective kill chain.</li>
<li>This requires prioritizing technologies and capabilities that enhance the U.S. military’s ability to understand, decide, and act faster and more effectively than its competitors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>From Platforms to Networks:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Instead of relying on small numbers of expensive and vulnerable platforms, the U.S. military must adopt a more networked and distributed approach.</li>
<li>This entails investing in:
<ul>
<li><strong>Interoperable Systems:</strong> Enabling seamless communication and data sharing between platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Resilient Networks:</strong> Developing robust networks that can withstand attacks and disruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> Leveraging AI for faster and more effective decision-making.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>From Offensive to Defensive:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. military must prioritize defensive capabilities that deter Chinese aggression and protect critical assets.</li>
<li>This includes:
<ul>
<li>Strengthening base defenses against missile attacks.</li>
<li>Developing more effective counter-space and cyber capabilities.</li>
<li>Investing in technologies that make U.S. platforms less vulnerable to detection and attack.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Embracing Autonomy and Unmanned Systems:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. military should accelerate the development and deployment of autonomous and unmanned systems.</li>
<li>This shift would:
<ul>
<li>Reduce reliance on vulnerable manned platforms.</li>
<li>Increase the speed and tempo of operations.</li>
<li>Enable the U.S. military to operate more effectively in contested environments.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rethinking Force Structure:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. military must move away from its traditional force structure of large, heavily manned platforms.</li>
<li>Instead, it should prioritize:
<ul>
<li>Smaller, more agile, and expendable platforms.</li>
<li>A greater emphasis on unmanned and autonomous systems.</li>
<li>A force that is designed for distributed and networked warfare.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Overcoming Institutional Inertia:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The biggest obstacle to transformation is not a lack of resources or technology but a lack of imagination and institutional inertia.</li>
<li>Overcoming this will require:
<ul>
<li>Strong leadership willing to challenge the status quo.</li>
<li>A cultural shift that embraces innovation and change.</li>
<li>A willingness to take risks and accept that failure is part of the innovation process.</li>

<ul>
<li>In 1991, amidst the backdrop of the Cold War’s end, Andrew Marshall, director of the Office of Net Assessment (ONA), initiated a project to assess the future of warfare.
<ul>
<li><strong>Andrew Marshall</strong>, often referred to as “Yoda,” held this influential position for 42 years, reporting directly to the Secretary of Defense.</li>
<li>The ONA’s primary mission was to evaluate the United States’ strategic standing against its competitors, mainly the Soviet Union.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Marshall, aided by Army Colonel Andrew Krepenevich, aimed to analyze the impact of emerging technologies and the Soviet Union’s collapse on international security and the U.S.’s role.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Gulf War (1991) unfolded as a demonstration of American military might, leaving a lasting impression on a young generation.
<ul>
<li>The conflict showcased technological advancements like stealth bombers, smart bombs, and superior air and ground power.</li>
<li>The U.S. achieved a swift victory with minimal casualties (129 combat deaths).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite the perceived success, Marshall’s 1992 report to the Secretary of Defense offered a different perspective.
<ul>
<li>He highlighted the influence of classified Soviet military writings that predicted a “<strong>military technical revolution</strong>.”
<ul>
<li>This revolution, termed the “<strong>reconnaissance strike complex,</strong>” proposed that advanced sensors and surveillance technologies, coupled with precision weaponry, would create the fastest, most effective kill chain in history.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While the Soviets saw the Gulf War as a testament to this concept, Marshall argued that the U.S. hadn’t even come close to achieving its full potential in this area.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A 1993 Pentagon study supported Marshall’s assessment.
<ul>
<li>The study revealed that the U.S. battle network remained largely unchanged since the Vietnam era.</li>
<li>It struggled to engage moving targets and relied heavily on “dumb bombs” instead of “smart” ones.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Admiral William Owens, future Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, later stated that the Gulf War was primarily won through “massed brute force,” akin to historical campaigns.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-revolution-in-military-affairs-the-need-for-transformation">A Revolution in Military Affairs: The Need for Transformation</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Marshall envisioned a <strong>revolution in military affairs (RMA),</strong> driven by information technologies.</p>
<ul>
<li>He cited historical examples of RMAs, such as the introduction of machine guns, steam-powered ships, and airplanes, emphasizing that technological advancements alone were insufficient.</li>
<li>Successful RMAs required developing new operational strategies and reforming existing military institutions for new strategic goals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Marshall warned that the U.S. was in the early stages of such a revolution, one that could last for decades.</p>
<ul>
<li>This RMA would center around information technologies that enhance understanding, decision-making, and action in war.</li>
<li>It would necessitate a shift in the concept of military power, potentially rendering traditional platforms like tanks, manned aircraft, and large ships less effective.</li>
<li>Marshall cautioned that failure to adapt to this RMA would leave the U.S. vulnerable to adversaries who successfully harnessed its potential.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Marshall’s analysts coined the term “<strong>anti-access and area denial capabilities</strong>” to describe how powerful adversaries could leverage this RMA to counter the U.S.’s platform-centric approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Despite its prescience, Marshall’s report failed to instigate significant change.</p>
<ul>
<li>The U.S., after the Soviet Union’s collapse, found itself in a unipolar world, with no immediate peer competitors.</li>
<li>This led to a sense of complacency, with leaders prioritizing a “peace dividend” by downsizing the military and focusing on peacekeeping and humanitarian missions.</li>
<li>The prevailing assumption was that future conflicts would resemble the Gulf War, fought against technologically inferior adversaries, allowing the U.S. to dictate the terms of engagement.</li>

<ul>
<li>Despite the lack of substantial change, the concept of RMA gained traction in Washington during the 1990s, driven by the fascination with the burgeoning information age.
<ul>
<li>“Revolution” and “transformation” became buzzwords, leading to numerous initiatives aimed at reimagining the U.S. military.
<ul>
<li>These initiatives included projects like “Army After Next,” “Network-Centric Warfare,” “Joint Vision 2010,” and “Lifting the Fog of War.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review, the Pentagon’s key strategy document, explicitly prioritized exploiting the RMA.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, despite the rhetoric and investments in defense technology, the U.S.’s way of fighting remained largely unchanged.
<ul>
<li>The interventions in Bosnia (1995) and Kosovo (1999) further reinforced this complacency.
<ul>
<li>These conflicts, won with minimal U.S. casualties (four non-combat deaths), were attributed more to adversary weakness than any significant U.S. transformation.</li>

<ul>
<li>These war games aimed to simulate future conflicts in a world where the RMA had reached maturity, pitting the U.S. against a hypothetical “large peer competitor” – implicitly China.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The war games were led by Robert Martinage and Michael Vickers, both future senior Pentagon officials.</p></li>
<li><p>Their 2001 report presented a stark assessment:</p>

<li>China, by 2025-2030, would possess advanced technologies comparable to the U.S., enabling it to target U.S. assets globally, including the homeland.</li>
<li>The U.S.’s reliance on traditional platforms and its vulnerability to attacks on its communication and logistics networks would render its traditional way of fighting ineffective.</li>
<li>The report stressed the need to fully embrace the RMA, building technologically advanced, networked forces, especially unmanned systems, to counter these threats.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-false-dawn-the-promise-of-transformation-and-the-reality-of-911">A False Dawn: The Promise of Transformation and the Reality of 9/11</h4>
<ul>
<li>The arrival of Donald Rumsfeld as Secretary of Defense in 2001 initially signaled potential progress.
<ul>
<li>Rumsfeld openly advocated for the RMA and created the Office of Force Transformation to oversee the development of new military technologies and doctrines.</li>
<li>He also signed a new defense strategy that prioritized addressing the operational challenges highlighted in Marshall’s 20XX war games, shifting focus toward emerging great powers like China.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, the 9/11 terrorist attacks drastically altered the strategic landscape, leading to a significant shift in priorities.
<ul>
<li>While Rumsfeld still emphasized transformation, the focus shifted towards waging a global war on terror.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The War on Terror did yield some genuine military innovations, primarily within the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC).
<ul>
<li>JSOC developed new technologies and tactics for counterterrorism missions, achieving remarkable speed and effectiveness in dismantling terrorist networks.</li>
<li>This innovation, along with the adoption of a counterinsurgency strategy in 2007, played a crucial role in weakening al-Qaeda in Iraq.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, the War on Terror ultimately sidetracked the U.S. from addressing the long-term challenge posed by China.
<ul>
<li>While the Bush administration claimed that both priorities could be managed simultaneously, the focus on counterterrorism, particularly the protracted conflict in Iraq, consumed the majority of resources and attention.</li>

<ul>
<li>Despite claims of transformation, the initial victories in Afghanistan and Iraq were, in essence, repetitions of past successes, achieved against significantly weaker opponents.
<ul>
<li>The U.S. retained its ability to dictate the terms of engagement, operate from secure sanctuaries, and leverage its technological superiority.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The core issue remained unchanged: the lack of urgency to embrace genuine transformation.
<ul>
<li>The perceived ease of these victories reinforced the belief in the U.S.’s military dominance and the validity of its traditional approaches to warfare.</li>
<li>Even as the Iraq War deteriorated into a strategic quagmire, the defense establishment largely dismissed it as an anomaly, clinging to outdated assumptions.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>A prevailing narrative within the defense establishment argues that the U.S. military’s lack of preparedness for future challenges stems from the overwhelming demands of the War on Terror, which consumed its budget and bandwidth.</p>
<ul>
<li>While the constant operational tempo undoubtedly took a toll, this narrative only tells part of the story.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The root cause lies in a failure of imagination and a misallocation of resources.</p>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. clung to the idea that a persistent global military presence, rather than investing in and showcasing innovative capabilities, would deter adversaries.</li>
<li>This strategy, however, led to the overextension and exhaustion of the military, with limited strategic gains.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Instead of prioritizing the development of faster, more adaptable kill chains through real-world experimentation, the U.S. poured vast sums into attempting to transform existing platforms, often with little success.</p></li>
<li><p>Billions were wasted on numerous modernization programs that were ultimately canceled without yielding any usable capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Examples include the Army’s Future Combat System ($18.1 billion), the Marine Corps’ Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle ($3.3 billion), and a host of other projects across all services.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Even those programs that weren’t canceled often faced significant delays, cost overruns, and ultimately failed to deliver the promised “transformational” capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>This includes high-profile programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Ford-class aircraft carrier, the KC-46 refueling tanker, and the Littoral Combat Ship, as well as numerous lesser-known systems.</li>
<li>Many of these systems were rushed into development before the underlying technologies were mature, leading to persistent problems and escalating costs.</li>

<ul>
<li>One of the most glaring failures was the lack of interoperability between different military systems, despite the emphasis on information sharing and joint operations.
<ul>
<li>Systems were often designed with incompatible communication and data-sharing protocols, hindering their ability to function as a cohesive network.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A prime example is the inability of the F-22 and F-35A fighter jets, both Air Force programs built by the same company, to directly share basic targeting data.
<ul>
<li>This lack of seamless integration forced reliance on outdated communication methods, such as voice transmissions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This issue of interoperability plagued all branches of the military, stemming from a system that incentivized closed, proprietary technologies, benefiting defense contractors while hindering the development of truly integrated kill chains.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>While some genuinely revolutionary technologies were explored, they often faced resistance and were ultimately sidelined or abandoned.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) made progress in areas like artificial intelligence, but these projects rarely transitioned into operational capabilities.</li>
<li>Other initiatives, such as the development of semi-autonomous long-range anti-ship missiles and unmanned combat air vehicles, struggled for funding and were eventually discontinued.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Navy’s X-47, the first unmanned aerial vehicle capable of launching from and landing on an aircraft carrier, demonstrated remarkable technological prowess but was canceled despite its success.</p></li>
<li><p>This resistance to innovation stemmed from the prioritization of traditional platforms, particularly manned aircraft, which were seen as central to the identity and budget justifications of the military services.</p>

<li>This approach ignored Marshall’s warnings that these legacy systems would become increasingly vulnerable in a future characterized by advanced reconnaissance strike complexes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The result was a collection of disparate sensors and weapons systems, lacking seamless interoperability and requiring significant time and effort to function cohesively.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>As the conflict dragged on, revealing critical equipment shortages (body armor, blast-resistant vehicles, and unmanned surveillance aircraft) and mounting casualties, the idea of technological transformation became associated with a failure to adequately equip and support troops in the present.</li>

<li><p>This fueled a backlash against “revolution,” shifting the focus back to conventional warfare and traditional platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li>By 2008, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates criticized what he termed “next-war-itis,” arguing against prioritizing future needs over current demands.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In reality, the more pervasive affliction was “last-war-itis” – an overreliance on past successes and a reluctance to adapt to a changing strategic environment.</p></li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="eisenhowers-approach-picking-winners">Eisenhower’s Approach: Picking Winners</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>President Eisenhower’s Philosophy:</strong> Concentrate resources and empower exceptional individuals (“<strong>founders</strong>”) to develop critical military technologies.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> General Bernard Schriever and the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).
<ul>
<li>Schriever was given broad authority, ample funding, and protection from bureaucratic interference.</li>
<li>His team successfully developed ICBMs, laying the groundwork for space exploration, in just five years.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Other “Founders” and their Achievements:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edward Teller:</strong> Developed the hydrogen bomb.</li>
<li><strong>Admiral Hyman Rickover:</strong> Developed miniaturized nuclear reactors for submarines.</li>
<li><strong>Kelly Johnson:</strong> Developed advanced aircraft, including the SR-71 Blackbird.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Prioritizing Speed and Results:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Efficiency and cost-effectiveness were secondary to rapid development and fielding of advanced weapons.</li>
<li>This approach was accepted as the price of staying ahead in the Cold War.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Silicon Valley’s Origins:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Defense contracts during and after World War II transformed Silicon Valley from an agricultural region into a hub of electronics and technology innovation.</li>
<li>This military funding fueled the development of technologies like mainframes, microprocessors, and the internet.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-new-global-arms-race-beyond-conventional-weapons">A New Global Arms Race: Beyond Conventional Weapons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Representatives from over 80 countries have been discussing a ban on <strong>lethal autonomous weapons</strong> since 2014.
<ul>
<li><strong>Lethal autonomous weapons:</strong> Defined by the Department of Defense as machines activated to select and engage targets without human intervention.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These weapons, often called “<strong>killer robots</strong>” by opponents, raise ethical concerns about removing humans from the kill chain.
<ul>
<li><strong>Kill chain:</strong> The process of identifying, targeting, and engaging an enemy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While China supports banning the <em>use</em> of these weapons, it has not committed to halting their <em>development</em>.
<ul>
<li>China’s definition of lethal autonomous weapons is narrow and does not encompass the full range of systems it’s developing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This discrepancy highlights a broader trend of rapidly developing military technologies, sparking fears of a global arms race encompassing:
<ul>
<li>Cyber weapons</li>
<li>AI</li>
<li>Hypersonic technology</li>
<li>5G networks</li>
<li>Quantum computing</li>
<li>Gene editing</li>
<li>Space capabilities</li>
</ul></li>
<li>China’s role in this arms race is particularly concerning due to:
<ul>
<li>Significant economic and military power</li>
<li>Less transparent intentions compared to other nations</li>
<li>A potential ambition to reshape the world order in favor of its illiberal values, including authoritarianism, crony capitalism, and surveillance states.</li>
<li>The perception of the United States as an obstacle to its ambitions.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-ethical-dilemma-of-intelligent-machines-in-war">The Ethical Dilemma of Intelligent Machines in War</h3>
<ul>
<li>The author recounts a poignant encounter with a Syrian mother who lost all five of her children in a barrel bomb attack, an experience that deeply affected both him and the late Senator John McCain.
<ul>
<li>This encounter underscores the profound human cost of war and serves as a stark reminder of the ethical considerations surrounding the use of force.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author grapples with the question of whether, as a potential civilian caught in a conflict, the knowledge of whether the weapon systems targeting him were operated by humans or machines would matter.
<ul>
<li>This question highlights a fundamental debate about the ethics of war in the age of intelligent machines:
<ul>
<li><strong>Is the morality of an action determined by the nature of the actor, or by the consequences of the action itself?</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author argues that the current debate about intelligent machines in war often misses the mark by focusing on the wrong questions.
<ul>
<li>He suggests that instead of fixating on the means of warfare (e.g., “killer robots”), we should prioritize the ends (i.e., the ethical use of force) and the principles of human accountability that should govern them.</li>

<section id="the-importance-of-command-and-control" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-importance-of-command-and-control">The Importance of Command and Control</h3>
<ul>
<li>The author criticizes the term “human-machine teaming” often used to describe the relationship between humans and intelligent machines in a military context.
<ul>
<li>He argues that this term implies a false equivalence between human operators and machines.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Instead, the author advocates for the concept of <strong>“human command and machine control,”</strong> emphasizing the hierarchical nature of the relationship where humans retain ultimate authority and responsibility.
<ul>
<li>This concept aligns with the long-standing military principles of command and control, ensuring that human judgment and ethics remain central to the use of force.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author acknowledges the concerns surrounding the potential for machines to act unethically.
<ul>
<li>However, he argues that humans have always exhibited a capacity for cruelty and that focusing solely on the perceived inhumanity of machines ignores the historical reality of human fallibility in war.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author emphasizes that the current debate should center around <strong>narrow artificial intelligence</strong> (AI), which is limited to performing specific tasks, rather than <strong>artificial general intelligence (AGI)</strong> or <strong>superintelligence</strong>, which remain speculative concepts.
<ul>
<li>He underscores that narrow AI, despite its capabilities, operates within the boundaries defined by its human creators.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="trust-accountability-and-the-limits-of-autonomy">Trust, Accountability, and the Limits of Autonomy</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Autonomy</strong> in the context of machines, the author clarifies, does not imply independent decision-making but rather the delegation of tasks within predefined parameters set by humans.</p>
<ul>
<li>This concept mirrors the existing military practice of granting autonomy to human subordinates, albeit with clear rules of engagement and accountability mechanisms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The author proposes a framework for building trust in intelligent machines, drawing parallels to the trust established between human commanders and their subordinates. This framework rests on three pillars:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Training:</strong> Rigorous training of machines to perform designated tasks effectively and ethically.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Testing:</strong> Repeated testing to ensure the machine’s reliability, predictability, and adherence to established parameters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trust:</strong> Trust is earned through consistent demonstration of competence and reliability in training and testing, leading to greater confidence in the machine’s ability to perform as intended.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The author underscores that accountability remains paramount. Just as commanders are responsible for the actions of their human subordinates, they would bear the responsibility for the actions of the machines under their command.</p>
<ul>
<li>This accountability extends to the entire chain of command, including those involved in training, testing, and deploying the intelligent machines.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="differentiating-roles-leveraging-human-judgment">Differentiating Roles: Leveraging Human Judgment</h3>
<ul>
<li>The author argues that one of the potential benefits of increased reliance on intelligent machines is the opportunity to free human operators from mundane and repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on more complex and ethically demanding aspects of warfare.
<ul>
<li>This shift could lead to a more ethical use of force by allowing humans to leverage their unique capacity for judgment, empathy, and moral reasoning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author acknowledges that current intelligent machines might outperform humans in certain tasks, particularly those requiring speed, accuracy, and consistency in data analysis and pattern recognition.
<ul>
<li>However, he stresses that machines should not be seen as replacements for human judgment in all instances.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author contends that while machines can enhance human decision-making by providing valuable insights and recommendations, the ultimate responsibility for decisions, especially those involving the use of lethal force, must remain with human commanders.
<ul>
<li>This approach ensures that human values and ethical considerations remain at the forefront of warfare.</li>

<section id="legal-and-ethical-considerations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="legal-and-ethical-considerations">Legal and Ethical Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The author argues that contrary to popular narratives, lethal autonomous weapons systems are not inherently illegal. He outlines the established legal criteria for determining the legality of a weapon:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Discrimination:</strong> The weapon should be capable of distinguishing between combatants and civilians.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proportionality:</strong> The use of the weapon should be proportionate to the military objective, minimizing unnecessary civilian harm.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Controllability:</strong> The effects of the weapon should be controllable, preventing unintended and widespread harm.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The author emphasizes that the legality of a weapon hinges on its inherent design and intended effects, not on the autonomy of the actor deploying it.</p>
<ul>
<li>He suggests that focusing solely on the “autonomy” of a weapon system misses the critical point that even autonomous weapons operate within the parameters defined by their human creators.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The author acknowledges the potential for errors and unintended consequences, even with highly intelligent machines.</p>
<ul>
<li>He argues that transparency, rigorous testing, and clearly defined rules of engagement are crucial for mitigating risks and ensuring accountability.</li>

<ul>
<li>He advocates for a more transparent approach to the development and deployment of intelligent machines in warfare.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author suggests that the U.S. should lead by example, demonstrating its commitment to ethical development and use of intelligent machines.
<ul>
<li>He proposes inviting international scrutiny and collaboration to establish norms and standards for the responsible use of these technologies.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>The author concludes by advocating for the development of lethal autonomous weapons systems, but with significant caveats.
<ul>
<li>He argues that the U.S. cannot afford to cede this technological advantage to rivals who may not share its ethical commitments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author draws a parallel to the development of nuclear weapons, suggesting that lethal autonomous weapons should be viewed as a deterrent, intended to prevent their use by adversaries.

<ul>
<li><strong>Jan Bloch</strong>, a Polish banker and military scholar, published a book in 1898 predicting how technology would transform warfare.
<ul>
<li>He accurately foresaw the lethality of modern battlefields due to technological advancements like:
<ul>
<li><strong>Machine guns</strong></li>
<li><strong>Smokeless gunpowder:</strong> This innovation would “lift the fog of war,” leaving armies exposed after initial volleys.</li>
<li><strong>Long-range artillery:</strong> Bloch calculated these were 116 times deadlier than those used a few decades prior.</li>
<li><strong>Improved rifles:</strong> Offering greater speed, accuracy, and range.</li>
<li>Other innovations: Including <strong>railroads, telegraphs, and steamships</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bloch believed this increase in lethality would make large-scale wars “impossible.”</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-political-and-cultural-dimensions-of-inertia">The Political and Cultural Dimensions of Inertia</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-Term Political Incentives:</strong> Elected officials prioritize immediate concerns of their constituents and are less likely to champion long-term investments in defense innovation that may not yield immediate political benefits.</li>
<li><strong>The Influence of Special Interests:</strong> While lobbying by defense contractors plays a role, the bigger issue is the dwindling number of major defense companies and the outsized influence of those focused on legacy systems. This limits competition and innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Decline in Military Experience in Congress:</strong> The declining number of lawmakers with direct military experience can lead to both excessive deference to the military’s judgment and a lack of understanding of its complexities.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Technical Expertise:</strong> The absence of technical backgrounds among political and military leaders hinders the understanding and adoption of emerging technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Resistance to Disruption:</strong> The shift to new technologies, while necessary, will inevitably cause economic and social disruption, creating resistance from those whose livelihoods depend on legacy systems.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-need-for-change-in-u.s.-defense">The Need for Change in U.S. Defense</h3>
<p>This chapter argues that the U.S. defense establishment needs significant change to adapt to future challenges. The author uses the case study of the JSTARS program and draws parallels to historical examples like the adoption of aircraft carriers and ICBMs to illustrate the need for a new approach. The chapter focuses on two key elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incentives:</strong> Rewarding innovation, agility, and the development of technologies that address future threats.</li>
<li><strong>Imagination:</strong> Moving beyond traditional platforms and doctrines to embrace new ways of warfare and leverage emerging technologies.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="case-study-the-jstars-program" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="case-study-the-jstars-program">Case Study: The JSTARS Program</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Problem:</strong> The Air Force’s plan to replace the aging JSTARS aircraft, a vital intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platform, with a new version of the same aircraft.
<ul>
<li>This plan was flawed because the new JSTARS would be vulnerable to attacks from advanced adversaries like China and Russia.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Solution:</strong> The Air Force proposed disaggregating JSTARS’s capabilities, distributing them across a network of unmanned aircraft and satellites. This approach offered greater resilience and survivability.</li>
<li><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Powerful members of Congress and defense contractors who stood to benefit from the continued production of the traditional JSTARS aircraft opposed the Air Force’s plan.</li>
<li><strong>The Success:</strong> The Air Force’s success in shifting to the new program stemmed from several factors:
<ul>
<li><strong>Political Strategy:</strong> Early and candid engagement with key stakeholders in Congress.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Providing detailed information about the threat to JSTARS and the advantages of the new program.</li>
<li><strong>Industry Engagement:</strong> Informing defense companies about the new plan, enabling them to lobby Congress.</li>
<li><strong>Compromise:</strong> Basing elements of the future program in the same state that would have hosted JSTARS, securing support from potential opponents.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Even good ideas require political maneuvering and strategic compromise to succeed within the existing defense system.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="obstacles-to-change-and-reasons-for-hope">Obstacles to Change and Reasons for Hope</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Obstacles:</strong> The U.S. defense establishment faces significant obstacles to change, including:
<ul>
<li><strong>Parochial Military Services:</strong> Prioritizing their own interests over joint solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Interested Companies:</strong> Focusing on profits and protecting existing programs.</li>
<li><strong>Distracted Political Leaders:</strong> Lacking focus on long-term defense planning and more concerned with short-term political gains.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reasons for Hope:</strong> Despite these obstacles, the United States possesses key elements for successful adaptation:
<ul>
<li><strong>Financial Resources:</strong> Ample funding for defense.</li>
<li><strong>Technological Leadership:</strong> Access to cutting-edge technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Skilled Workforce:</strong> A talented pool of engineers and innovators.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Core Issue:</strong> The main obstacle lies in Washington, D.C., and stems from:
<ul>
<li><strong>Dysfunctional Political System:</strong> Hampering the ability to make tough but necessary decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Vision:</strong> A failure to envision and implement necessary defense reforms.</li>
<li><strong>Urgency Deficit:</strong> A lack of urgency to drive change.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="restructuring-incentives-for-a-future-ready-military">Restructuring Incentives for a Future-Ready Military</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Imperative:</strong> To prepare for future threats, the U.S. must restructure its defense incentives to favor:
<ul>
<li><strong>Networked Kill Chains:</strong> Over legacy platforms.</li>
<li><strong>New Ways of War:</strong> Over familiar doctrines.</li>
<li><strong>Defense:</strong> Over offense.</li>
<li><strong>Future Needs:</strong> Over present requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Software:</strong> Over hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid Capability Development:</strong> Over acquisition compliance and cost accounting.</li>
<li><strong>Technological Diversity:</strong> Over reliance on traditional defense contractors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Mechanism:</strong> Achieving this shift necessitates:
<ul>
<li><strong>Leadership Ownership:</strong> Senior leaders in the Department of Defense and Congress must champion and drive change.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> A partnership between the Pentagon and Congress to establish shared expectations and present a unified front to stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Vision:</strong> Recognizing that transforming the military is a multi-year process requiring sustained commitment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Defining the Problems:</strong> Translating vague concepts into actionable operational problems, such as:
<ul>
<li><strong>Denying China Military Dominance:</strong> Specifically, developing the capability to neutralize 350 Chinese ships within the first three days of a conflict, a challenge requiring advanced ISR, real-time information sharing, and rapid decision-making.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shifting the Paradigm:</strong> Moving away from traditional requirements and budget processes towards:
<ul>
<li><strong>Mission-Focused Competitions:</strong> Allocating significant funding to real-world competitions that identify the best solutions to specific operational challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Rewarding Winners:</strong> Providing substantial funding and fielding opportunities to the winners of these competitions, regardless of their affiliation (military service, established company, or startup).</li>
<li><strong>Embracing Rivalry:</strong> Leveraging the inherent rivalries between military branches and companies to drive innovation and accelerate the development of effective solutions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Transitioning Incrementally:</strong> Acknowledging that the shift from legacy platforms to future technologies will be gradual:
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Enhancement:</strong> New technologies will initially enhance existing platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Gradual Replacement:</strong> Over time, new technologies may replace legacy systems entirely.</li>
<li><strong>Mission Adaptation:</strong> Traditional platforms may find new roles, such as homeland defense, as their relevance in high-intensity conflicts diminishes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Power of Demonstration:</strong> Showing, not just telling, to build support for change:
<ul>
<li><strong>Deterrence through Demonstration:</strong> Convincing adversaries of U.S. military capabilities by showcasing new technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Domestic Persuasion:</strong> Demonstrating the effectiveness of new solutions to skeptical military leaders and policymakers to build domestic political support.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="fostering-a-vibrant-defense-technology-ecosystem" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fostering-a-vibrant-defense-technology-ecosystem">Fostering a Vibrant Defense Technology Ecosystem</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Problem:</strong> A lack of private investment in defense technology due to:
<ul>
<li><strong>Perceived Risk:</strong> The defense sector is viewed as a risky investment with a high failure rate for new technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Government Commitment:</strong> The government often fails to purchase promising technologies at scale, discouraging private investment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Solution:</strong> Creating incentives for private investment by:
<ul>
<li><strong>Picking Winners:</strong> Identifying and investing heavily in companies developing essential technologies like AI and autonomous systems.</li>
<li><strong>Clear Signals:</strong> Sending strong signals to the market about the government’s commitment to purchasing these technologies in large quantities.</li>
<li><strong>Multiplier Effect:</strong> Large government contracts will attract significantly more private investment, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation and growth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rethinking Earmarks:</strong> Reconsidering the ban on congressional earmarks, with safeguards for transparency and accountability, to enable Congress to directly fund promising defense technologies.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Lobbying:</strong> Encouraging companies developing future-oriented military capabilities to actively lobby for their programs and secure political support.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Addressing the “Culture Problem”:</strong> The U.S. defense establishment needs to overcome its risk-averse, bureaucratic culture and embrace agility, competition, and a willingness to fail.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="boredom-in-the-classroom">Boredom in the Classroom</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Experience:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Taught for 30 years, observing pervasive boredom in schools.</li>
<li>Students found work stupid, meaningless, and unengaging.</li>
<li>Teachers were equally bored, blaming students’ lack of interest and focus on grades.</li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Grandfather’s Lesson:</strong> Boredom is the individual’s responsibility, not an external condition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Root of the Problem:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Schools perpetuate childishness by treating boredom and obedience as the norm.</li>
<li>Gatto observed that breaking free from these structures could foster curiosity, adventure, and resilience in students.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="questioning-the-system">Questioning the System</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>A System Functioning as Designed:</strong>
<ul>
<li>What if schools are intentionally designed to produce the observed outcomes?</li>
<li>Could the goal be to prevent genuine growth and maintain a controllable populace?</li>
<li>Is forced schooling truly necessary, especially considering successful individuals who thrived without it?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Historical Perspective:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Many accomplished figures throughout American history lacked formal schooling.</li>
<li>Formal schooling does not guarantee success.</li>
<li>Compulsory schooling became widespread in the US between 1905 and 1915.</li>

<li>To create good citizens.</li>
<li>To foster personal growth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Actual Purpose (Revealed):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>H. L. Mencken (The American Mercury, April 1924):</strong>
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The aim of public education is not to fill the young of the species with knowledge and awaken their intelligence… The aim is simply to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level, to breed and train a standardized citizenry, to put down dissent and originality.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Prussian Model:</strong>
<ul>
<li>American education is rooted in the Prussian system.</li>
<li>Designed to create a manageable populace through:
<ul>
<li>Mediocre intellect.</li>
<li>Suppression of individuality.</li>
<li>Limited leadership skills.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Premise:</strong> Institutional schooling, contrary to popular belief, is a flawed system deliberately designed to control and limit human potential rather than foster it.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-factory-inspectors-survey-1909">The Factory Inspector’s Survey (1909)</h4>
<ul>
<li>A survey of 500 working children in 20 factories revealed that 412 of them preferred the harsh conditions of factory work to returning to school. (Source: Helen Todd, <em>Why Children Work</em>, McClure’s Magazine, April 1913)
<ul>
<li><strong>Archive:</strong> <a href="https://uofi.app.box.com/s/agtvym7n0hvf4qw2dr5d24txsgwrgc42">Why Children Work: The Children’s Answer By Helen M. Todd</a></li>
<li>Helen Todd received various reasons from children for favoring factory work, including:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Monetary Factors:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Being paid for the factory work they do.</li>
<li>The ability to support their families financially, afford more food, shoes for babies, and other basic needs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Difficulty and Relevance of Schoolwork:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Perceived difficulty in understanding schoolwork compared to factory work.</li>
<li>Learning being perceived as hard.</li>
<li>Some children feeling unable to learn.</li>
<li>Perception that school education is not relevant to their ability to earn.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Environment at School and Factory:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Preference for the factory environment as there is less judgment compared to school.</li>
<li>The factory environment doesn’t involve name-calling or bullying as in school.</li>
<li>They can avoid the corporal punishment experienced at school for:
<ul>
<li>Failure to learn</li>
<li>Whispering</li>
<li>Having string in their pocket</li>
<li>Squeaky seats</li>
<li>Late arrival</li>
<li>Forgetting pages of the book</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Implication:</strong> This finding challenges the conventional narrative that school is a universally desired and beneficial experience, suggesting that early schools were deeply flawed and potentially more unbearable than child labor.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-rise-of-the-experts-1919-1933">The Rise of the “Experts” (1919-1933)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Professor Arthur Calhoun</strong> (Social History of the Family, 1919) observed a shift from family-centered child rearing to a system where <strong>community experts</strong> increasingly controlled education. (page 175)
<ul>
<li>Calhoun believed this change aligned with the eugenics movement, promoting the idea of selective breeding and social control through education. (page 331)</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mayor John Hyland</strong> of New York City (1922) claimed that an “<strong>invisible government</strong>” had seized control of the city’s schools, likening the situation to an octopus capturing its prey.
<ul>
<li>Hyland pointed to the <strong>Rockefeller Foundation</strong> as a driving force behind this shift in power.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By 1928, <em>A Sociological Philosophy of Education</em> asserted that teachers were responsible for “running not merely schools, but the world.”

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Edward Thorndyke</strong> (Columbia Teachers College, 1929), a prominent figure in <strong>Educational Psychology</strong>, declared that traditional <strong>academic subjects are of little value</strong>.
<ul>
<li>This statement reflects a move away from traditional academic goals towards a focus on social engineering and behavioral conditioning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>William Kilpatrick</strong> (Columbia Teachers College, <em>Education and the Social Crisis</em>, 1929) advocated for expert control over child rearing, arguing that families were ill-equipped compared to trained professionals.
<ul>
<li>This perspective underscores the growing influence of a technocratic elite seeking to manage society through scientific methods.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Max Mason</strong>, President of the Rockefeller Foundation (April 11, 1933), announced a national program aimed at controlling human behavior, with schools playing a central role.
<ul>
<li>This announcement signaled an open embrace of social engineering as a primary goal of education.</li>
<li>The program drew inspiration from <strong>Max Muller</strong>, a geneticist who believed in the possibility of controlling human evolution through genetic manipulation.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-eugenics-connection">The Eugenics Connection</h4>
<ul>
<li>The influence of eugenics, a movement advocating for selective breeding to improve the human race, played a significant role in shaping early 20th-century education reform.
<ul>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> To separate “worthwhile breeding stock” from the “evolutionary dead-end material” (Source: Muller’s geneticist’s manifesto, signed by 22 prominent biologists).</li>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> This ideology promoted segregation and discrimination within the education system, reinforcing social hierarchies based on perceived intellectual ability and social worth.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-post-war-shift-from-education-to-indoctrination">The Post-War Shift: From Education to Indoctrination</h4>
<ul>
<li>World War II temporarily drove eugenics underground, but its core principles continued to influence education policy.
<ul>
<li>The focus shifted towards using schools as tools for social control and economic manipulation, aligning with the needs of a burgeoning industrial capitalist system.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Two congressional investigations (1915 and 1959) revealed that school policy was being shaped by corporate interests operating outside of public scrutiny.
<ul>
<li><strong>Findings:</strong> Both investigations concluded that major foundations like Carnegie and Rockefeller exerted significant influence over education policy through funding, research, and advocacy.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> These investigations were largely ignored, and their findings suppressed, highlighting the lack of transparency and accountability within the education system.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher training underwent a radical transformation, driven by private foundations, universities, and government agencies, with the goal of aligning education with the needs of the emerging global economy.</li>
<li><strong>Three key milestones:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>1. Designing Education for the Future:</strong> A government initiative that redefined education as a means to achieve national economic and social goals.

</ul></li>
<li><strong>2. The Behavioral Science Teacher Education Project (BSTEP):</strong> A large-scale project (Contract No.&nbsp;OEC-09-320424-4042) outlining plans to transform schools into laboratories for behavioral conditioning.
<ul>
<li><strong>Goals:</strong> To create a system where individuals are tracked from birth, exposed to subliminal influence, and conditioned to conform to predetermined beliefs and behaviors.</li>
<li><strong>Methods:</strong> Advocated for the use of chemical experimentation on minors, foreshadowing the rise of drugs like Ritalin and Adderall in classrooms.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>3. Bloom’s Taxonomy of Educational Objectives:</strong> A comprehensive manual by <strong>Benjamin Bloom</strong> (University of Chicago) that aimed to classify and control all aspects of human learning.
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide educators with a framework for shaping students’ thoughts, feelings, and actions through carefully designed instruction.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="teachers-as-therapists">Teachers as Therapists</h4>
<ul>
<li>Rising school violence in the 1960s, partly attributed to policies restricting disciplinary action, provided a pretext for further intervention.
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Ford Foundation’s</strong> policy mandating “<strong>due process</strong>” in schools hampered teachers’ ability to maintain order and address disruptive behavior effectively.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>BSTEP advocated for training teachers as “<strong>teacher therapists</strong>,” tasked with applying behavioral psychology techniques to manage students’ emotions and modify their behavior.</li>
<li>This shift marked a significant departure from traditional teaching roles, transforming educators into agents of social control.</li>

<section id="we-dont-need-brains" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="we-dont-need-brains">“We Don’t Need Brains”</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Historical Context:</strong> Between 1896 and 1920, industrialists and financiers like <strong>Andrew Carnegie</strong> and <strong>John D. Rockefeller</strong>, through their foundations, heavily influenced the development of compulsory schooling in the US.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>To create a workforce that was obedient, compliant, and trained for specific tasks rather than independent thinking and innovation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Evidence:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>The General Education Board</strong> (funded by Rockefeller), in its 1906 <strong>Occasional Letter No.&nbsp;1</strong>, stated its aim:
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“In our dreams, people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hands…We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning…The task…is very simple. We will organize children and teach them to do in a perfect way the things their fathers and mothers are doing in an imperfect way.”</p>

<section id="the-literacy-decline-a-case-study-in-failure" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-literacy-decline-a-case-study-in-failure">The Literacy Decline: A Case Study in Failure</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>World War II Literacy Data:</strong> A high literacy rate (96%) was observed among men drafted during World War II (schooled in the 1930s), with only 4% deemed illiterate. (Source: Army enlistment tests)</li>
<li><strong>Korean War Literacy Decline:</strong> A significant drop in literacy (down to 81%) was observed among men drafted during the Korean War (schooled in the 1940s).</li>
<li><strong>Vietnam War Literacy Crisis:</strong> Illiteracy rates continued to rise, reaching 27% among men drafted during the Vietnam War (schooled in the 1950s and 1960s).</li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Despite increased years of schooling, more qualified teachers, and “improved” educational materials, literacy rates steadily declined.</li>
<li>This suggests that changes in teaching methods, particularly the shift from <strong>phonetic</strong> to <strong>non-phonetic</strong> reading instruction, played a significant role in the decline.</li>
<li>The lack of a phonetic foundation disproportionately impacted Black Americans, who historically had limited access to formal education and relied on schools to teach basic literacy skills.</li>
<li>The <strong>Adult Literacy Survey</strong> and the <strong>National Assessment of Educational Progress</strong> later reported a 40% illiteracy rate among Black Americans and 17% among White Americans.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="william-torrey-harris-the-architect-of-american-indoctrination">William Torrey Harris: The Architect of American Indoctrination</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background:</strong> <strong>William Torrey Harris</strong>, U.S. Commissioner of Education (1889-1906), was a leading proponent of Hegelian philosophy and a close friend of Andrew Carnegie.</li>
<li><strong>Influence:</strong> Harris played a pivotal role in shaping the American education system, promoting standardization and German-style compulsory schooling.</li>
<li><strong>Philosophy:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Harris believed that children were property of the state and that education’s purpose was to create citizens who were obedient, subservient to authority, and alienated from their individuality.</strong></li>
<li>He advocated for schools that were designed to “<strong>transcend the beauty of nature</strong>” and promote withdrawal from the external world.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Key Quotes:</strong>
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“<strong>Ninety-nine students out of a hundred are automata, careful to walk in prescribed paths, careful to follow the prescribed custom. This is not an accident but the result of substantial education which, scientifically defined, is the subsumption of the individual.</strong>” (Source: <em>The Philosophy of Education</em>, 1906)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“<strong>The great purpose of school [is] self-alienation…It is to master the physical self, to transcend the beauty of nature. School should develop the power to withdraw from the external world.</strong>” (Source: <em>The Philosophy of Education</em>, 1906)</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Harris’s ideas laid the groundwork for an education system designed to create a compliant workforce rather than critical thinkers. His influence can still be felt in the emphasis on standardized testing, conformity, and the suppression of creativity within many schools today.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-fourth-purpose-creating-human-resources">The Fourth Purpose: Creating Human Resources</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Original Purpose of Schooling:</strong> The traditional goals of education—moral development, civic responsibility, and personal growth—were gradually supplanted by a new objective: to produce human resources for the industrial economy.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate Influence:</strong> As schools became increasingly intertwined with the needs of business and industry, the curriculum shifted towards vocational training, obedience to authority, and the acceptance of a hierarchical social order.</li>
<li><strong>Woodrow Wilson’s Vision (1909):</strong> In a speech to businessmen, Wilson stated,
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“<strong>We want one class to have a liberal education. We want another class, a very much larger class of necessity, to forego the privilege of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific, difficult manual tasks.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Centralized Control:</strong> The rise of the “<strong>Education Trust</strong>” in 1917, comprised of representatives from powerful foundations, elite universities, and the National Education Association, further consolidated control over education policy in the hands of a select few.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences:</strong> This shift in purpose transformed schools from institutions of learning into factories for producing compliant workers, undermining the ideals of a free and democratic society.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem-of-overproduction">The Problem of Overproduction</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Overproduction</strong>, also known as <strong>overcapacity</strong>, occurs when businesses produce more goods and services than the market can consume, leading to falling prices, economic instability, and social unrest.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Context:</strong> In the 19th century, America’s independent and resourceful population, coupled with its high levels of innovation, frequently led to overproduction and economic downturns.</li>
<li><strong>The Role of Education:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Policymakers and business leaders began to view education as a tool to manage overproduction by shaping consumer demand and limiting independent economic activity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> By conditioning citizens from a young age to become reliable employees rather than self-sufficient producers, the threat of overproduction could be mitigated.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences:</strong> This approach transformed education from a means of fostering independence and innovation into a tool for controlling the workforce and maintaining economic stability for the benefit of those in power.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-alternative-a-return-to-open-source-learning">The Alternative: A Return to Open-Source Learning</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>The American Experiment:</strong> For the first two centuries of its existence, the United States thrived on a system of open-source learning, where individuals were free to pursue knowledge and skills through apprenticeship, self-study, and community engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Figures like Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and David Farragut exemplified the success of this approach, demonstrating that traditional education was not a prerequisite for achieving greatness.</li>
<li><strong>The Value of Self-Reliance:</strong> This system fostered independence, ingenuity, and a spirit of innovation, propelling America to the forefront of global progress.</li>
<li><strong>The Need for a Paradigm Shift:</strong> Gatto argues for a return to the principles of open-source learning, recognizing that the current system of compulsory schooling stifles creativity, limits human potential, and perpetuates social inequalities.</li>

<li><strong>The Urgency of Reform:</strong> The consequences of this system—declining literacy rates, rising social inequality, and a culture of conformity—demand urgent attention and a radical rethinking of education’s purpose.</li>
<li><strong>A Call to Action:</strong> The book serves as a wake-up call to reclaim the transformative power of education, urging readers to question assumptions, challenge the status quo, and create alternative systems that empower individuals and foster a more just and equitable society.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence:</strong> A brochure from Harvard University outlining nine essential skills for success in the new international economy is cited as a benchmark.
<ul>
<li><h4 id="nine-essential-skills" class="anchored">Nine Essential Skills:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ability to ask hard questions of data from various sources.</li>
<li>Ability to define problems independently.</li>
<li>Ability to extract useful information from irrelevant data.</li>
<li>Ability to conceptualize.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto presents David Sarnoff’s life as a counterpoint to the failures of the education system.
<ul>
<li><strong>David Sarnoff’s Accomplishments:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Learned English and became a successful newsboy within five months of arriving in New York City at age nine, after his father died.</li>
<li>Owned his own newsstand at fourteen, using newspapers as his primary learning source.</li>
<li>Became an office boy at Marconi Wireless at fourteen through sheer initiative.</li>
<li>Taught himself telegraphy, leading to a successful career in the burgeoning field of radio technology.</li>
<li>Became president of RCA at age 39.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Sarnoff’s success was a result of self-directed learning, initiative, and real-world experience, not formal education.</li>

<ul>
<li>A pervasive culture of negativity and limitations (“you can’t do this, you can’t do that”).</li>
<li>Excessive emphasis on standardized tests.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto argues that a culture of complacency, self-preservation, and corruption within the district perpetuates its failures.
<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence:</strong>
<ul>
<li>High teacher turnover rate (22% annually) is attributed to a “caste system” that rewards favored teachers with desirable assignments while burdening others with impossible workloads.</li>
<li>Inflated administrative bureaucracy and a “shadow economy” divert resources away from teaching and contribute to a deceptive student-teacher ratio.</li>
<li>Administrators prioritize their careers and maintaining the status quo over meaningful educational reform.</li>
<li>A principal’s statement that students’ futures are predetermined, highlighting a defeatist attitude toward disadvantaged students.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Policy 1: Tolerance of Disruptive Behavior:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The decision, influenced by the Ford Foundation, to not control disruptive classroom behavior out of concern for students’ self-esteem is criticized as misguided and harmful.</li>
<li>Gatto contends that this policy has created a chaotic learning environment that hinders all students, including those who are well-behaved.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Policy 2: Recruitment of Disruptive Students:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The district’s practice of recruiting disruptive students from other areas to mask declining enrollment is condemned as a cynical maneuver that exacerbates the existing problems.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> These policies, combined with a lack of accountability for administrators, have resulted in a decline in educational standards and a system that fails to serve its students.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto argues that the current education system functions as a “narcotic,” addicting children to passivity, entertainment, and a detachment from reality.
<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Students’ lack of interest in exploration, play, and personal growth.</li>
<li>Excessive consumption of television, music videos, and computer games.</li>
<li>The observation that children from stable, two-parent households where the mother does not work engage in far less passive entertainment.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto’s essay, “I Quit, I Think,” published in the Wall Street Journal, outlines their reasons for leaving the profession:
<ul>
<li><strong>Government schooling is the most radical adventure in history</strong>, killing the family by:
<ul>
<li>Monopolizing childhood’s best times.</li>
<li>Teaching disrespect for home and parents.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The structure of schooling is rooted in an <strong>Egyptian, not Greek or Roman, blueprint</strong>, based on the belief that:
<ul>
<li><strong>Human value is scarce</strong>, symbolized by a pyramid’s narrow peak.</li>
<li>This idea, passed down through the Puritans, found scientific expression in the <strong>bell curve</strong>, which suggests talent is biologically determined.</li>
<li><strong>School serves as the church of this religious notion, with rituals to maintain orthodoxy.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Professional educators benefit from making the simple seem complex</strong>, subordinating the public to their expertise.</li>
<li><strong>School, as a jobs program, contract provider, and guardian of the social order, resists reform.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reform efforts fail to fundamentally change the system.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Standardized measures like age grading and testing are arbitrary and harmful</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Children develop at different paces, and judging them by uniform standards is illogical.</li>
<li>Gatto uses the example of David (reading at age 4) and Rachel (reading at age 9), who show no difference in reading ability at age 13.</li>
<li>School, however, would label Rachel as learning disabled and hold David back, creating artificial categories and dependencies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto argues that <strong>learning disabilities and giftedness are “sacred myths,”</strong> perpetuating the school system.</li>
<li><strong>True education is not standardized;</strong> there are countless ways to learn, like fingerprints.</li>
<li><strong>State-certified teachers are not essential for education and may hinder it.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Good schools need free-market choices and variety, not more money or time.</strong></li>
<li><strong>National curriculum and testing are based on ignorance of how people learn.</strong></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-religion-of-schooling-and-the-myth-of-dumbness">A Religion of Schooling and the Myth of Dumbness</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto reflects on their 30-year career, questioning how they participated in an <strong>indoctrinating and sorting machine</strong> that steals children’s potential.</li>
<li>School, they argue, is a <strong>religion</strong>; understanding its “holy mission” is crucial to understanding its workings.</li>
<li>While human failings exist within the system, they are not the root cause; <strong>schooling itself is designed to produce “dumbness.”</strong></li>
<li><strong>This new dumbness is not mere ignorance but a categorization of relative stupidity</strong>, creating artificial hierarchies like:
<ul>
<li>Gifted and talented</li>
<li>Mainstream</li>
<li>Special Ed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These categories ration learning, benefiting the system and social order.</li>
<li>The <strong>“new dumb” are perceived as dangerous and require conditioning with “commercially prepared disinformation.”</strong></li>
<li>This dumbness particularly harms middle and upper-middle-class children, already pressured to conform, leaving them vulnerable to existential crises later in life.</li>
<li>Gatto cites English historian Alan Bullock: <strong>“Evil is a state of incompetence.”</strong> Schooling, they argue, has filled the 20th century with evil by breaking children to a system that rewards compliance over critical thinking.</li>
<li>This system produces individuals dependent on group approval, exemplified by a National Merit Scholar in Gatto’s family who aspired to be “a small part in a great machine.”</li>
<li><strong>The “dumbed down” cannot think independently, constantly seeking external validation and vulnerable to manipulation.</strong></li>
<li>Gatto challenges prevalent explanations for “dumbness”:
<ul>
<li><strong>Biological determinism (the bell curve)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Capitalist oppression (neo-Marxism)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Moral failing (Calvinism)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Natural selection (Darwinism)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Social utility (pragmatic elitism)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Karmic retribution (Buddhism)</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>All these explanations, Gatto contends, justify the existence of a vast bureaucracy to manage the “problem” of the “dumb.”</li>
<li>Gatto’s proposition: <strong>mass dumbness is a fabrication, not a reality.</strong> It was invented to serve the system.</li>

<li>Labeled an “outlaw” for minor infractions that would not have been criminalized in the past.</li>
<li>Attending one of New York State’s lowest-rated schools, facing potential state takeover.</li>
<li>Placed in the “Mainstream D” category, the lowest of the low, above only Special Ed.</li>
<li>Standardized test scores placed him three years behind his peers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite this, Hector displays initiative and a desire to challenge norms, as seen in his gate-crashing experiment.</li>
<li>His “criminal” record includes:
<ul>
<li>Being caught with a fake gun in his former elementary school during Christmas break.</li>
<li>Intending to “free the slaves” (the younger children) like a modern-day Spartacus.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This incident highlights the school’s perception of Hector as a problem, as expressed by the principal: “Gatto, what have you done to me?”</li>
<li>A year later, Hector’s high school record shows:
<ul>
<li>Failing every subject.</li>
<li>Excessive absences and truancy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The system paints a picture of Hector as a lost cause:
<ul>
<li>Poor, small, minority, ignored, “dumb,” a trouble-maker, a failure.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto asks: <strong>What is society to do with its Hectors?</strong></li>
<li>Hector represents millions of children deemed problematic by the education system.</li>
<li>Gatto argues that <strong>schooling was reimagined to control children like Hector</strong>, turning it into:
<ul>
<li>A warehouse</li>
<li>A behavior modification clinic</li>
<li>A tool for attitude adjustment</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This system is justified as a defense against chaos, with Hector representing the chaos that needs taming.</li>
<li>The principal, in the documentary about Gatto’s class, acknowledges the system’s flaws but defends it as better than chaos.</li>
<li>Gatto challenges this notion: <strong>Is chaos the only alternative to a stifling system?</strong></li>
<li><strong>The real demon, Gatto argues, is the misperception that Hector is the problem.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Forced schooling, presented as a bulwark against chaos, is actually the source of the problem.</strong></li>
<li>The belief that <strong>human nature’s irrationality must be suppressed</strong> is presented as a dangerous dogma driving the education system.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto, a school teacher and advisor for TV Free America, observed negative behavioral patterns in TV-addicted children:
<ul>
<li>Irresponsibility</li>
<li>Childishness</li>
<li>Dishonesty</li>
<li>Maliciousness</li>
<li>Lack of purpose</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These children seemed to lose the ability to behave with integrity and grow up, as if their spirits were dwarfed by consuming too many fabricated stories and explanations.</li>
<li>Gatto felt that computers often worsened the problem, leading to:
<ul>
<li>Exposure to pornography</li>
<li>Playing against programs instead of other people</li>
<li>Passive consumption rather than active participation</li>
<li>Crossing the line into a passive state even with the internet, unless good discipline was exercised.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto sought a solution to counteract the negative effects of excessive media consumption, recognizing that traditional preaching was ineffective.</li>
<li>Gatto believed that relief could be found by encouraging physical activity and real-life experiences, as opposed to passively consuming media.</li>
<li>The core issue identified was the suppression of <strong>natural feedback circuits</strong>, which are essential for learning from mistakes.</li>
<li>Gatto uses the example of learning to sail:
<ul>
<li>A novice sailor will inevitably make mistakes, such as tacking too far left or right.</li>
<li>However, through practice and feedback, the sailor learns to adjust and improve.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Similarly, mastering speech requires significant practice and feedback.</li>
<li>Gatto argues that bureaucracies, including school systems, often fail because they cannot efficiently respond to feedback.
<ul>
<li>They are bound by rigid rules and resistant to input from parents, teachers, students, or outside sources.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto observed that the rigid structure of traditional schooling limited students’ opportunities for growth through feedback.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto’s solution was a <strong>guerrilla curriculum</strong> designed to restore natural feedback circuits in children.</li>
<li>This curriculum targeted inactivity and activities that did not significantly engage feedback mechanisms.</li>
<li>Gatto believed that sufficient activity, regardless of its specific nature, would motivate children to reduce their screen time.</li>
<li>The goal was to shift children from being passive spectators to active participants in their own lives.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration from the Camino de Santiago:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Camino de Santiago is a medieval pilgrimage route across northern Spain, ending at the burial place of the Apostle James in Santiago de Compostela.</li>
<li>Thousands of people undertake this pilgrimage annually, seeking personal growth, self-reliance, connection with nature, and time for reflection.</li>
<li>Gatto drew inspiration from the Camino, recognizing that a similar pilgrimage could help children reconnect with themselves, their families, and the natural world.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto, with the support of parents, sent 13-year-old students on solo journeys on foot through New York City’s five boroughs.</li>
<li>These expeditions involved:
<ul>
<li>Walking the circumference of Manhattan (approximately 30 miles)</li>
<li>Exploring different neighborhoods, observing and analyzing their characteristics</li>
<li>Mapping Central Park, university campuses, business districts, churches, and museums</li>
<li>Visiting government departments, such as the Board of Education or police headquarters, individually</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Students documented their observations, conducted interviews, researched, and created guide pamphlets.</li>
<li>Gatto encouraged solo expeditions as they offered the most significant learning opportunities, but students could also opt for shorter trips.</li>

<li>The guidebook meticulously describes every road in Iceland, bringing the land and its history to life through vivid anecdotes.</li>
<li>Inspired by this approach, Gatto’s students created their own “visitors’ keys” to various aspects of New York City:

<li>Safe spots for playing hooky</li>
<li>Notable pizza parlors</li>
<li>Architectural features of brownstone buildings</li>
<li>Swimming pools in the five boroughs, including sociological analyses of their cultural context</li>

<li>Gatto observed that engaging with reality through intellectually stimulating work activated feedback circuits in most students, leading to substantial personal growth.</li>
<li>By April, many students who had initially displayed negative behaviors transformed into interesting and productive individuals.</li>
<li>Gatto emphasizes that embracing challenges is fundamental to self-mastery and competence, a concept likely discovered in humanity’s early days.</li>
<li>Gatto was surprised by how easily this transformation was achieved, requiring neither exceptional talent nor financial resources.</li>
<li>While implementing the curriculum with 130 students annually was challenging, Gatto believes it would be significantly easier in a system that prioritized learning over social control.</li>
<li>Gatto received numerous awards from the school establishment, which was unaware of the curriculum’s unconventional nature.</li>

<li>Real risks to take</li>
<li>Real ideas to grapple with</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Historical accounts of schooling are overwhelmingly negative.</strong>
<ul>
<li>This raises questions about why schooling has persisted with minimal changes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Potential trade-offs:</strong> Schooling weakens family and social relationships, but there may be unseen benefits to this disconnection.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on winning over learning:</strong> School prioritizes winning, leading to scandals when students’ lack of knowledge is exposed.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural implications:</strong> Sending children to strangers for instruction reflects a significant statement about modern culture that deserves reflection.</li>
<li><strong>Examples of negative portrayals of school:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Horace’s ode on the torments of schooling.</li>
<li>Pompeii mosaics depicting harsh school discipline.</li>
<li>Washington Irving’s <em>Story of the Headless Horseman</em> as a revenge fantasy against a schoolmaster.</li>

<li><strong>Sabotaging the system:</strong> Gatto sought to peacefully disrupt the school system, inspired by Lusserin’s resistance.</li>
<li><strong>Personalized curriculum:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1: Assembling a student biography:</strong> Gathering detailed information about each student’s life, relationships, experiences, and achievements from various sources.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2: Identifying wishes and weaknesses:</strong> Asking students to list three things they want to learn and three weaknesses they want to overcome.</li>
<li><strong>No censorship:</strong> Respecting student priorities and incorporating them into the curriculum.</li>
<li><strong>Parental involvement and confidentiality:</strong> Enlisting parental support and ensuring discretion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Implementation:</strong> This approach required willpower, imagination, resourcefulness, and a disregard for obstructive rules.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Motivated students, increased effort, and recruitment of outside resources.</li>
<li><strong>Researching the origins of schooling:</strong> Gatto embarked on a research project to understand the historical development, global spread, and resilience of institutional schooling.

<li><strong>Education as compensation:</strong> Smith believed education was necessary to counter the negative psychological effects of capitalism.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalism’s psychological damage:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Makes workers cowardly.</li>
<li>Makes workers stupid.</li>
<li>Makes workers sluggish.</li>
<li>Makes workers indifferent to everything except basic needs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Educational schooling:</strong> Smith advocated for education that heals the damage caused by capitalism to community and individuality.</li>
<li><strong>Potential of all children:</strong> Smith believed all children possess the same inherent talents, regardless of social class.
<ul>
<li>Differences are created by <strong>deliberate deprivation</strong> of intellectual stimulation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consequences of deprivation:</strong> Deformed minds, inability to think critically, and loss of judgment.</li>
<li><strong>Relevance to modern schooling:</strong> Smith’s description resonates with the state of public education today.</li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s counterattack:</strong> Gatto’s personalized curriculum aimed to address cowardice, stupidity, sluggishness, and indifference.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on partnerships:</strong> Working with motivated students to achieve their individual goals.</li>
<li><strong>Schooling the unmotivated:</strong> Those who were not interested in education were subjected to traditional schooling methods.</li>
<li><strong>Smith’s insight:</strong> The differences between “bright” and “stupid” students are largely manufactured through deliberate deprivation.</li>

<li><strong>Controlling creativity:</strong> Highly creative individuals are also viewed with suspicion and kept under close supervision.</li>
<li><strong>The ideal employee:</strong> Scientific management seeks employees who are obedient, enthusiastic about following orders, and eager to please.</li>
<li><strong>Training for obedience:</strong> Schooling begins the process of conditioning for obedience from the first grade.</li>
<li><strong>The “don’t” drill:</strong> Primary school emphasizes limitations and restrictions, stifling natural curiosity and self-expression.</li>

<li><strong>Topic:</strong> The future of schools in the year 2000</li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Pessimistic View:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schools in 2000 will likely mirror those of 1990 and 1890.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>1790:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Education was readily attainable in America.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Schooling was:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Voluntary</li>
<li>Short in duration</li>
<li>Did not monopolize a child’s time</li>
<li>Did not burden families</li>
<li>Did not instill servile habits in the young</li>
<li>Did not indoctrinate with pre-determined thoughts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fewer people claiming to provide education resulted in greater freedom to learn.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Example: In Massachusetts, literacy rates were higher when schooling was voluntary.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Today:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The possibility of obtaining a quality education is threatened by compulsory schooling.</li>
<li>Political roadblocks hinder change:
<ul>
<li>The current system financially benefits those in power.</li>
<li>Schools provide lucrative contracts and jobs, creating conflicts of interest for politicians.</li>
<li>Politicians are beholden to donors with vested interests in maintaining the status quo.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Assertion:</strong> Genuine change must come from individuals (parents, students, and teachers) who challenge the system.</li>
<li>Homeschooling is a prime example of this rebellion.</li>
<li>The system has had a century to prove itself and has failed.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1: Define an Educated Person:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A nationwide debate is needed to establish a clear definition of what constitutes an educated person.</li>
<li>Professional pedagogy has failed to provide a concrete definition beyond vague generalizations.</li>
<li>A shared understanding of educational goals is crucial for meaningful reform.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exposing the Fallacy of Standardized Testing:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current educational emphasis on standardized test scores is misguided.</strong></li>
<li><strong>High test scores do not necessarily translate to real-world competence or success.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong>** Many successful individuals (including U.S. presidents and corporate executives) have achieved success despite mediocre test scores.</li>
<li><strong>Inconsistency:</strong> While consumers demand performance data in other areas (e.g., horse racing), they are denied this information when it comes to educators.</li>
<li><strong>Distinction:</strong> High standards are not synonymous with standardized testing.</li>
<li><strong>Newspeak Manipulation:</strong> The public has been conditioned to equate the two.</li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Proposal:</strong> Schools should guarantee the development of valuable human competencies or lose their power to enforce attendance.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto’s granddaughter, Christina, is a rebellious and accomplished individual.
<ul>
<li>Rode her bike on Fifth Avenue in defiance of a city ban.</li>
<li>Captain of a national champion debating team.</li>
<li>Legally changed her name from Gudrun to Christina.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto comes from a long line of “boat rockers” and contrarians.
<ul>
<li>His wife Janet’s family was outlawed by the British Crown.</li>
<li>His great-great-grandmother from Glenorchy wore a top hat, a symbol of unconventionality.</li>
<li>The outlaw Rob Roy considered Gatto’s wife’s clan to be his own.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto and his wife Janet were married in a Buddhist temple near Columbia University in New York City.
<ul>
<li>They chose this location because they were both unemployed, broke, and underage for a civil marriage.</li>
<li>The Buddhist temple offered free marriage ceremonies, unlike other religious institutions they approached.</li>
<li>Janet was pregnant with Gatto’s daughter (Christina’s mother) at the time of their marriage.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto recounts the struggles and triumphs of his ancestors:
<ul>
<li><strong>His grandmother:</strong> Fired from a job for attempting to organize a union.</li>
<li><strong>Gatto:</strong> Fired from a job on Madison Avenue for incompetence.</li>
<li><strong>His great-great-grandfather Giovanni (Italian side):</strong>
<ul>
<li>A Presbyterian, journalist, and Freemason, he faced persecution in early 20th century Italy.</li>
<li>Forced to flee Italy with his wife, Lucrezia, who lost her inheritance and title for marrying him.</li>
<li>Found success in Pittsburgh working for Mellon Bank but died young from an extravagant lifestyle.</li>
<li>Buried in an unmarked grave by Lucrezia for having a mistress.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>His great-grandfather Harry Taylor Zimmer (German side):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Town printer and traveling circus owner in Monongahela, Pennsylvania.</li>
<li>A staunch Republican in a predominantly Democratic town.</li>
<li>Ran for mayor multiple times, using his printing press to launch scathing attacks on opponents.</li>
<li>Openly supported German victory during World War II, making Gatto’s childhood walks to school eventful.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto highlights the protective presence of his uncle, Bud Zimmer:
<ul>
<li>The toughest man in town, Bud’s reputation shielded Gatto from bullies.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto advises his granddaughter, Christina, to reconsider her pursuit of an Ivy League education at Dartmouth.
<ul>
<li>He believes that such institutions promote an illusion of social privilege and limit personal growth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He criticizes the modern education system:
<ul>
<li><strong>Promotes a hierarchical view of education:</strong> Elite colleges are falsely touted as the sole gateways to success.</li>
<li><strong>Instills a false sense of urgency:</strong> Students feel pressured to gain acceptance into prestigious colleges, leading to unhealthy competition and anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>Perpetuates social inequality:</strong> Gatto uses George Orwell’s <em>Animal Farm</em> analogy to criticize the elitist mindset prevalent in prestigious institutions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He challenges the notion that college guarantees success:
<ul>
<li>Financial success can be achieved through alternative paths.</li>
<li>True fulfillment comes from finding purpose and adding value to society.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He argues that true education is a personal journey of self-discovery:
<ul>
<li>It’s about developing critical thinking skills and navigating the complexities of the world.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He outlines eight essential elements of true learning:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Self-knowledge:</strong> Understanding one’s character, strengths, weaknesses, and tendencies.</li>
<li><strong>Observation:</strong> Cultivating sharp observational skills to gather accurate information.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Learning to receive and evaluate criticism effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Developing the ability to break down complex problems into manageable components.</li>
<li><strong>Mirroring:</strong> Cultivating empathy and the ability to understand diverse perspectives.</li>
<li><strong>Expression:</strong> Mastering clear and effective communication in both written and spoken forms.</li>
<li><strong>Judgment:</strong> Developing the ability to discern truth from falsehood and make sound decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Adding Value:</strong> Contributing meaningfully to society and every interaction.</li>

<section id="the-new-atlantis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-new-atlantis">The New Atlantis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto argues that the current education system, particularly in elite institutions like Dartmouth, is modeled after Francis Bacon’s <em>The New Atlantis</em>.</li>
<li>He outlines the core principles of Bacon’s vision:
<ul>
<li><strong>Utility over Reflection:</strong> Education should primarily focus on training a workforce for the needs of corporations and government institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Social Control:</strong> Universities should function as instruments to maintain social order and stability.</li>
<li><strong>Surveillance and Control:</strong> Implement systems to monitor and regulate the behavior and aspirations of the masses.</li>
<li><strong>Managed Morality:</strong> Promote a culture of permissiveness in personal morals while emphasizing conformity in professional life.</li>
<li><strong>Co-option of Potential Leaders:</strong> Identify and absorb talented individuals from lower classes into the ruling structure to prevent dissent.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto argues that this system has led to several negative consequences:
<ul>
<li><strong>Social Unrest:</strong> A growing sense of disillusionment and distrust in leadership due to increasing inequality and lack of opportunity.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Inequality:</strong> The widening gap between the rich and the poor, fueled by corporate greed and the exploitation of workers.</li>
<li><strong>Contingent Labor:</strong> The rise of temporary and insecure employment, creating a precarious workforce without benefits or long-term security.</li>
<li><strong>Lean Production:</strong> The relentless pursuit of efficiency and profit maximization at the expense of worker well-being and job satisfaction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto concludes by emphasizing that addressing these issues requires political action and a fundamental shift in societal values rather than relying solely on traditional education systems.
<ul>
<li>He urges his granddaughter to be an agent of change and fight for a more just and equitable society.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="schoolings-imperial-ambition">Schooling’s Imperial Ambition</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schooling’s Expansion:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Originating as a limited endeavor in colonial America (2 hours/day, a few months/year), schooling has steadily expanded its reach.</li>
<li>It now encroaches upon personal time and resists boundaries like summer vacation.</li>
<li>The concept of “<strong>lifelong learning</strong>” often translates to “lifelong schooling,” promoting the idea that more schooling is always the solution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Schooling as a False Solution:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto argues that societal issues (incoherence, aimlessness, incompetence, class hatred) often attributed to a lack of schooling are, in fact, exacerbated by it.</li>
<li>More schooling, he contends, cannot fix problems created by the institution itself.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Schooling’s Assault on Alternative Forms of Development:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Schooling undermines and seeks to supplant other vital sources of growth and learning:
<ul>
<li><strong>Family:</strong> Dismissed as a “retrograde institution” to be replaced by idealized, expert-designed models.</li>
<li><strong>Church:</strong> Seen as a threat to Gattoity of expert opinion and therefore targeted for removal.</li>
<li><strong>Tradition, Ethnic Loyalty, Loyalty to Place:</strong> Deemed obstacles to progress and slated for eradication.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This systematic dismantling of alternative influences, Gatto argues, cripples individual sovereignty, erodes ideals of liberty, and disrupts the natural transmission of knowledge and values across generations.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="schooling-vs.-education-key-distinctions">Schooling vs.&nbsp;Education: Key Distinctions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto presents several key distinctions between schooling and education:
<ul>
<li><strong>Source of Organization:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schooling:</strong> Controlled externally through command and control structures.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Self-directed and driven by internal motivation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Connection to Learning Sources:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schooling:</strong> Isolates students from diverse learning opportunities to maintain administrative efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Actively seeks out a rich network of connections – random, intentional, varied, and often unexpected – recognizing that resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and innovation thrive on diverse inputs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Role of Feedback:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schooling:</strong> Relies on external rules and evaluations, limiting opportunities for independent judgment and self-correction.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Emphasizes the crucial role of natural feedback loops. Students learn to attend to these loops, not to conform to external dictates, fostering self-reliance and personalized learning pathways.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Focus of Learning:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schooling:</strong> Prioritizes subject knowledge and specialization, aiming to produce efficient clerks for predefined roles within existing systems.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Values broad contexts and connections between disciplines, recognizing that true understanding and innovation often emerge from cross-fertilization of ideas.
<ul>
<li>Example: John Cancius, a non-specialist and college dropout, developed a breakthrough cancer treatment precisely because he wasn’t confined by specialized knowledge.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Approach to Knowledge:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schooling:</strong> Emphasizes memorization and acceptance of established truths, discouraging critical thinking.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Cultivates a state of internal debate and questioning, constantly seeking to challenge and refine existing knowledge.
<ul>
<li>This echoes Schumpeter’s concept of “<strong>creative destruction</strong>” – the driving force of capitalism – where questioning established norms and seeking better alternatives fuels progress.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact on Well-being:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto cites the <strong>International Happiness Survey</strong>, which consistently identifies three key factors for a happy life:
<ul>
<li>Good relationships.</li>
<li>Good health.</li>
<li>Satisfying work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Schooling, however, often undermines these factors:</strong>
<ul>
<li>It promotes unhealthy lifestyles and offers little support for developing strong relationships.</li>
<li>Tracking systems and segregation by background exacerbate class prejudice, hindering relationships across difference.</li>
<li>The work imposed rarely connects with the genuine interests and passions of young people.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto acknowledges the potential for criticism: Are his views exaggerated? Is schooling not an essential institution with flaws that can be rationally addressed?</li>
<li>He counters by suggesting the presence of a “<strong>dark force</strong>” – a deliberate, hidden agenda operating within the institution of schooling.</li>
<li>He argues that without exposing and confronting this hidden force, any talk of “school reform” is futile.</li>
<li>To support his claim, he presents three “hair-raising school stories” designed to illustrate the seemingly irrational and even sinister nature of schooling’s influence:

<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> January 29, 2008</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Nuremberg, Germany</li>
<li><strong>Victim:</strong> Melissa Busekros, a 16-year-old girl</li>
<li><strong>Event:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Melissa is forcibly removed from her home by 15 police officers and city officials.</li>
<li>Her “crime” is homeschooling, a practice outlawed in Germany since 1937 under the Nazi regime.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Author’s Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li>He expresses his disgust by writing to the German ambassador in Washington, highlighting the disturbing parallels between contemporary Germany and its Nazi past.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Details of the Incident:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Despite no history of behavioral issues, Melissa is subjected to a 240-minute psychiatric interrogation focused solely on her reasons for homeschooling.</li>
<li>The interrogation concludes that Melissa suffers from “school phobia,” a dubious diagnosis used to justify the forceful intervention.</li>
<li>German authorities cite Melissa’s “delayed development” by one year as evidence of harm, despite lacking any internationally recognized standard for such assessment.</li>
<li>The court order authorizes the forceful removal of Melissa, deeming it necessary to protect her from her parents’ “illegal conduct” of homeschooling.</li>
<li>The German Education Authority vows to “bring convictions of the family into line,” employing language reminiscent of totalitarian regimes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Author’s Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>He questions the reasoning, philosophy, and values driving such extreme measures against a peaceful family exercising their right to choose an alternative educational path.</li>
<li>He draws parallels between this incident and Germany’s dark history of persecution, from witch hunts to the Holocaust, suggesting a dangerous pattern of suppressing individual liberty and enforcing conformity through state power.</li>
<li>He criticizes the German education system’s rigid adherence to rules and its stifling of individual initiative, citing the ThyssenKrupp steel plant debacle as evidence of its negative economic consequences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto’s letter to the German ambassador receives no reply.</li>
<li>The incident highlights the extreme measures employed to enforce compulsory schooling and the silencing of dissenting voices.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> March 25, 2004</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Highland High School, Rockland County, New York</li>
<li><strong>Event:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto is invited to speak at Highland High by school board member John Jankowicz, who is concerned about the negative effects of the school’s rigid, test-driven approach to education.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Observations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>He notes the affluence of the school and the students’ sense of entitlement, masking a deeper lack of intellectual curiosity and critical thinking skills.</li>
<li>He recognizes the pervasive climate of fear and dishonesty surrounding college admissions, used as a tool to control student behavior.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Talk:</strong>
<ul>
<li>He decides to address the students’ anxieties by deconstructing the myths surrounding college admissions, using real-world examples to challenge their assumptions.</li>
<li>He presents evidence that many successful individuals, including industry leaders, writers, and even politicians, did not conform to the traditional model of academic success.</li>
<li>He cites examples of college dropouts who have achieved extraordinary things, challenging the notion that elite college acceptance is the only path to a meaningful life.</li>
<li>He encourages students to question Gattoity of school officials and to demand transparency regarding their own educators’ academic records.</li>
<li>He shares information about the admission policies of prestigious universities, emphasizing that factors beyond grades and test scores, such as initiative, creativity, and real-world experience, are highly valued.</li>
<li>He presents Richard Branson’s entrepreneurial success as an example of a high school dropout who defied expectations and achieved extraordinary things.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Police Intervention:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In the midst of Gatto’s calm and factual presentation, a police detail suddenly enters the auditorium and orders everyone to leave.</li>
<li>The officer in charge uses a bullhorn to assert control, creating a deliberately intimidating atmosphere.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Aftermath:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto learns that the superintendent, McCarthy, deemed the talk “inflammatory” and called the police to shut it down.</li>
<li>This extreme reaction, despite Gatto’s calm demeanor and factual content, suggests a deep-seated resistance to any challenge of the established schooling narrative.</li>
<li>Gatto’s scheduled evening talk for parents is also canceled, further demonstrating the school’s determination to suppress dissenting views.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Media Coverage and Silence:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The local newspaper, the Mid-Hudson Highland Post, publishes a sanitized account of the incident, omitting any mention of the police intervention.</li>
<li>The superintendent falsely claims that Gatto showed a “violent film,” further highlighting the school’s dishonest attempts to control the narrative.</li>
<li>Gatto’s subsequent attempts to gather perspectives from the superintendent, principal, parents’ association, and student newspaper are met with complete silence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The incident at Highland High demonstrates the power of fear and control within the school system.</li>
<li>It shows how easily authorities can silence dissenting voices and suppress information that challenges the status quo.</li>
<li>The lack of transparency and accountability further reinforces the idea of a hidden agenda at work.</li>

<li>The state of Vermont threatens to close Walden’s beloved one-room schools, citing the cost of making them wheelchair accessible as prohibitive.</li>
<li>This is despite the schools’ strong academic performance, the community’s satisfaction, and the children’s evident well-being.</li>
<li>A plan is put forward to build a centralized concrete block school and bus students from up to 50 miles away.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Author’s Involvement:</strong>
<ul>
<li>He is invited to Walden to advocate for the preservation of the one-room schools.</li>
<li>He reviews the state’s proposal and finds the estimated costs for renovations to be grossly inflated.</li>
<li>He seeks expert testimony from a renowned architect familiar with construction costs in Vermont.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Expert Opinion and Fear:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The architect confirms that the state’s estimates are ten times higher than the actual cost, suggesting a deliberate attempt to mislead the community.</li>
<li>He reveals that the contract for the new school has likely already been promised to a specific firm, further highlighting the corruption at play.</li>
<li>However, the architect refuses to testify publicly, fearing professional repercussions from the state government.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Despite Gatto’s best efforts and the community’s desire to preserve their schools, the state’s repeated threats and the climate of fear prove too powerful.</li>
<li>Walden reluctantly approves the bond issue, goes into debt, and builds the centralized school, sacrificing their unique educational environment and sense of community control.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Walden incident demonstrates how a powerful entity like the state government can exploit its authority and financial leverage to impose its will on a community.</li>
<li>It highlights the corrupt practices often used to justify decisions made behind closed doors, benefiting select interests at the expense of local needs and desires.</li>
<li>The architect’s fear of speaking out reveals the insidious reach of such systems and the potential for silencing dissent even within professional circles.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-the-urgent-need-for-subversion">Conclusion: The Urgent Need for Subversion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto uses these three incidents to illustrate the pervasive and often hidden forces at play within the institution of schooling.</li>
<li>He argues that these forces prioritize control, conformity, and the maintenance of power over the genuine needs and well-being of students.</li>
<li>He concludes that true education requires a conscious effort to subvert the harmful aspects of schooling, to question its assumptions, and to seek out alternative paths to knowledge and personal fulfillment.</li>
<li>Gatto issues a call to action:
<ul>
<li>Recognize the dark side of schooling and its impact on individuals and society.</li>
<li>Actively resist its attempts to limit thinking, creativity, and individual potential.</li>
<li>Seek out alternative educational experiences that nurture curiosity, critical thinking, and a love of learning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto believes that by understanding and challenging the hidden agendas of schooling, individuals can reclaim their right to a meaningful and empowering education. He leaves the reader with the responsibility to carry on this fight:
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“But you’ll have to convince yourself of the substance of my allegation, that some sort of dark matter, some powerful but invisible force is at work in schooling. If you are to become strong enough to defend yourself and your family, I can’t do the work for you. You can’t memorize my conclusions.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Because you choose not to see the dark world school represents, because you only pay attention to its stupidities, it gets worse all the time.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Do I mean to imply that Highland School is the worst school in America? Hardly. For all I know, it is one of the best. Certainly it’s one of the richest. What you need to ask yourself is how many school districts from coast to coast find truth unbearable because it gets in the way of their real mission.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Unless the ends of the operation are put on public trial, and its sexual relationship with economics and social management exposed to the light and ended, each reform effort will only be another illusion, another room added to the National House of Mirrors.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Our government thinks some companies are too big to be allowed to fail, and that schooling is too important to allow education to get in its way.”</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Destroy the standardized testing industry.</li>
<li><strong>Method:</strong> Open conspiracy with individuals acting as independent unit commanders.</li>
<li><strong>Reasoning:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Standardized testing is more damaging than beneficial to individuals and society.</li>
<li>Test destruction, not reform, is the only solution.</li>

<li><strong>Ineffectiveness:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Information generated is unreliable and misleading.</li>
<li>Data is unused in adult life.</li>
<li>No correlation between test performance and future success.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Damaging Effects:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Significant personal and social harm to students.</li>
<li>Ranking system creates winners and losers, fostering a sense of inferiority.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tool of Social Control:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Weaponized by social engineers to control institutional schooling.</li>
<li>Used to classify individuals as human resources.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Waste of Resources:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hundreds of millions of school days lost to test preparation, administration, and recovery.</li>
<li>Tens of billions of dollars diverted to private companies.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-outlaw-ethic-of-institutional-schooling">The Outlaw Ethic of Institutional Schooling</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> New York City Public Schools’ failure to provide mandated physical education.
<ul>
<li>Only 1 in 25 students receive the legal minimum of 24 minutes of physical education per day (New York Sun, May 8, 2008).</li>
<li>Parents concerned about lack of physical education, but have no significant voice in school decisions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consequences:</strong>
<ul>
<li>National epidemic of childhood obesity and diabetes.</li>
<li>Physical and psychological harm to students.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Institutional Hypocrisy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>NYC Board of Education claims to be “beginning to realize” the importance of student health after a century of control (New York Sun, May 8, 2008).</li>
<li>Schools continue to prioritize confinement over physical activity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Institutional schooling operates with an outlaw ethic, disregarding student well-being.</li>
<li>Schools will act against student and faculty interests under pressure.</li>

<section id="the-decline-of-american-education" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-decline-of-american-education">The Decline of American Education</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Post-World War II:</strong> Schooling replaced education.
<ul>
<li>Standardization based on the German model.</li>
<li>Standardized testing implemented and gradually gained importance (fully implemented by 1963).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>1950s:</strong> Curriculum dumbed down, teachers became less connected to the community.</li>
<li><strong>1960s:</strong> Test scores become the primary measure of excellence.</li>
<li><strong>1970s:</strong> Schools become a lucrative business, further incentivizing the status quo.
<ul>
<li>Eccentricity in teaching is persecuted.</li>
<li>Tracking systems solidify the division of students based on perceived ability.</li>
<li>Curriculum for affluent students is equivalent to that of working-class students in the 1940s-50s.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-assumption-of-inherent-inferiority">The Assumption of Inherent Inferiority</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prevalent Belief:</strong> The majority of the population is inherently incapable of intellectual growth beyond a mental age of 12.</li>
<li><strong>Proponents:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Abraham Lincoln ridiculed this view in 1859 (Richard Hofstadter’s <em>Anti-Intellectualism in American Life</em>).</li>
<li>Edward Thorndike, inventor of educational psychology at Columbia Teachers College.</li>
<li>H.H. Goddard, Chairman of the Psychology Department at Princeton.</li>
<li>James Bryant Conant, President of Harvard.</li>
<li>Major private foundations (e.g., Rockefeller, Carnegie).</li>
<li>Historical figures like Plato, John Calvin, Benedict Spinoza, Johann Fichte, Charles Darwin, and Francis Galton.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consequences:</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Foundational Rights:</strong> American founding documents guarantee inalienable rights, including liberty, that are undermined by compulsory schooling.</li>
<li><strong>Need for Drastic Action:</strong> Revitalizing education requires a complete rejection of government control (Alexander Sholzhenitsyn, “How to Revitalize Russia,” <em>Pravda</em>, September 18, 1988).</li>
<li><strong>The Bartleby Solution:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Inspired by Herman Melville’s short story “Bartleby, the Scrivener” (1853).
<ul>
<li>Bartleby, a copyist, exercises passive resistance by responding to requests with, “I would prefer not to.”</li>
<li>This simple act disrupts the workplace and exposes the limitations of control.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Students are called upon to peacefully refuse standardized tests.</li>
