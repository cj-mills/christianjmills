My name is Christian Mills. I'm an independent AI consultant and educator who helps businesses solve critical problems with practical, real-world artificial intelligence.

I partner with clients to navigate the entire AI project lifecycle, from initial strategy and de-risking to building and deploying robust, high-performance solutions.

## My Philosophy: A Consultant and an Educator

AI projects are complex and filled with uncertainty. My value lies in being more than just a technical expert; I'm your strategic partner.

*   **As a Consultant,** I focus on the business outcome. I translate your goals into a viable technical strategy, anticipate the real-world challenges (like messy data and hardware limitations), and keep the project focused on delivering measurable results.
*   **As an Educator,** I believe in transparency and empowerment. I demystify the technology, communicate progress and setbacks clearly, and ensure you're a collaborator in the process. This approach is reflected in the [free, in-depth tutorials](/series/tutorials/) I publish, sharing my knowledge with the broader community.

This dual approach ensures we not only build the right solution but also build your confidence and capability in AI.

## How I Solve Problems: Core Expertise

I specialize in tackling the tough, practical challenges that determine an AI project's success:

*   **Custom AI Solution Development:** Designing and building end-to-end systems tailored to your specific business problem, with a focus on robustness and real-world performance.
*   **Overcoming Data Bottlenecks:** Creating automated synthetic data pipelines and efficient annotation workflows, transforming a common project-killer into a strategic advantage.
*   **High-Performance Edge AI:** Optimizing and deploying models for real-time performance on edge devices like the Jetson Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi, making sophisticated AI feasible in resource-constrained environments.
*   **LLM Integration & Fine-Tuning:** Leveraging the power of Large Language Models for a variety of business applications through strategic integration and customization.
*   **AI Strategy & Project De-risking:** Providing the expert guidance needed to validate an idea, create a clear roadmap, and avoid common pitfalls before significant investment is made.

## Proof of Expertise: Selected Project Outcomes

*   **Engineered an end-to-end synthetic data factory** that allowed a client to accelerate their R&D cycle and reduce dependency on slow, manual data collection.
*   **Achieved 3x to 5x inference speed improvements** for real-time computer vision models by applying advanced optimization techniques (quantization, TensorRT), enabling deployment on low-cost edge hardware.
*   **Rapidly mastered and deployed solutions on unfamiliar hardware** (Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi with Hailo AI) to meet specific client needs, demonstrating adaptability and a commitment to finding the right solution.
*   **Built a custom, high-speed object tracking algorithm in C++** when off-the-shelf solutions were insufficient to meet performance targets.
