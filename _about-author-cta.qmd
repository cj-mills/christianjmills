::: {.callout-tip title="About Me:"}
I'm Christian Mills, an Applied AI Consultant and Educator.

Whether I'm writing an in-depth tutorial or sharing detailed notes, my goal is the same: to bring clarity to complex topics and find practical, valuable insights.

If you need a strategic partner who brings this level of depth and systematic thinking to your AI project, I'm here to help. Letâ€™s talk about de-risking your roadmap and building a real-world solution.

Start the conversation with my [Quick AI Project Assessment](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKDKPJF9Be47LA3nrEDXTVpzH2UMLz8SzHMHM9hWT5qlvjkw/viewform?usp=sf_link) or learn more [about my approach](/about.html).
