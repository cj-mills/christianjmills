<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wells-vision-and-its-influence">Wells’ Vision and its Influence</h3>
<ul>
<li>In “Things to Come,” Wells portrays a <strong>technocratic elite</strong> called “Wings Over the World,” a group of airmen who exemplify the emerging technological professional class.</li>
<li>Wells’ concept: This new class, possessing advanced scientific knowledge and skills, would naturally assume leadership after the decline of the old order.</li>
<li>Wells’ utopian vision includes:
<ul>
<li>A technocratic elite ruling over a scientifically advanced society.</li>
<li>Aggressive deployment of technology to solve global problems.</li>
<li>Victorian-style exploration and adventurism, prioritizing results over individual safety.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wells’ villains in “Things to Come” are the <strong>“do-nots,”</strong> individuals who are content with their comfortable lives and resist technological progress.
<ul>
<li>This conflict is not a social class struggle but a clash between those who embrace progress (“doers”) and those who oppose it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The “do-nots” represent a more nuanced version of the <strong>Eloi</strong> from Wells’ “The Time Machine,” highlighting the potential for societal stagnation due to prolonged comfort and safety.</li>

<li>This optimism was reflected in the growing genre of <strong>post-war world literature</strong>, which often echoed the themes of H.G. Wells’ work.</li>
<li>A 1944 review of two books, “Your World Tomorrow” and “Miracles Ahead,” titled “Green Light for the Age of Miracles,” exemplified this optimistic outlook.</li>
<li>The review highlighted predictions for transportation, including:
<ul>
<li>Cars with wings for air travel.</li>
<li>Helicopter “flivers” (small personal aircraft).</li>
<li>Affordable giant airliners enabling global travel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While flying cars and flivers remain unrealized, the prediction of affordable air travel has come true.</li>
<li>The books also accurately predicted other advancements:
<ul>
<li>High-octane gasoline, factory-built housing, portable radios, pocket-sized televisions, air conditioning, plastics, synthetic foods and materials, electronic cooking controls, fluorescent lights, and global tourism.</li>

<li><strong>The Great Stagnation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tyler Cowen’s book <em>The Great Stagnation</em> (2011) argues that the US entered a period of economic slump in the 1970s after a period of rapid progress due to the exploitation of easily accessible technological advancements.</li>
<li>This stagnation is reflected in slow income growth and a decline in the “American Dream”.</li>
<li>Cowen uses median income rates as evidence, while Peter Turchin highlights the flatlining of unskilled labor wages.</li>

<li><strong>Cost Disease:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> The phenomenon where the costs of essential goods and services (e.g., housing, education, healthcare) continue to rise in real terms, even after adjusting for inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Housing costs have doubled since the 1960s.</li>
<li>Primary education costs have tripled, without a corresponding increase in learning outcomes.</li>
<li>Healthcare costs have risen sixfold, while longevity growth has slowed.</li>
<li>College tuition and textbooks cost roughly ten times more.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Distinguishing from Efficiency-Driven Price Changes:</strong> Cost disease is distinct from situations where prices decrease due to increased efficiency (e.g., mass production).</li>
<li><strong>Secular Economic Decline:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Since the 1970s, actual economic growth has fallen below the historical trend line and has not recovered.</li>
<li>The per capita GDP growth rate dropped from 2.8% (pre-1970) to 1.9% (post-1970).</li>

<li><strong>Example:</strong> The de Havilland Ghost turbojet engine (1950s) had 5,000 pounds of thrust, while the GE-90 (1990s) had 115,000 pounds of thrust.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Unfulfilled Expectations:</strong> Based on the rapid progress in the first half of the 20th century, people in 1962 expected further significant increases in airliner speed, range, and capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Stagnation in Air Travel:</strong> Instead of further advancements, air travel has seen little improvement in the past 50 years, with some aspects even declining in the pursuit of fuel efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Market for Faster Travel:</strong> Despite the existence of technology for faster air travel, it has not been implemented, suggesting roadblocks beyond economic considerations.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Considerations:</strong> For long international flights, the energy required to fly through the atmosphere is comparable to that needed for orbital flight, which could be significantly faster.</li>
<li><strong>Iconic Example of Stagnation:</strong> The plateau in air travel serves as a representative example of the broader stagnation in life-improving technologies observed since the 1970s.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Analogy:</strong> The transition from wooden sailboats to steel steamships demonstrates that the adoption of more expensive technology can be justified by its superior performance.</li>

<li><strong>Quote:</strong>
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The coal output of the world, speaking roughly, doubled every ten years between 1840 and 1900, in the form of utilized power, for the ton of coal yielded three or four times as much power in 1900 as in 1840. Rapid as this rate of acceleration in volume seems, it may be tested in a thousand ways without greatly reducing it. Perhaps the ocean steamer is nearest unity and easiest to measure, for anyone might hire in 1905, for a small sum of money, the use of 30,000 steam horsepower to cross the ocean. And by halving this figure every ten years, he got back to 234 horsepower for 1835, which was accuracy enough for his purposes.” - Henry Adams</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Henry Adams Curve:</strong> A historical trend of roughly 7% annual growth in usable energy available to civilization, observed since the early days of the steam engine.</li>
<li><strong>Factors Contributing to the Curve:</strong>
<ul>
<li>3% population growth.</li>
<li>2% energy efficiency growth.</li>
<li>2% growth in per capita energy consumption.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Flatlining of Energy Consumption:</strong> The Henry Adams curve plateaued in the 1970s, as shown by US energy consumption data.</li>
<li><strong>The 1970s Energy Crisis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The energy crisis was caused by Nixon’s price controls (1971), followed by the OPEC oil embargo (1973).</li>
<li>The Department of Energy (established 1977) is jokingly suggested to have been created to prevent energy use.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Human Power vs.&nbsp;Modern Energy Use:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Before the Industrial Revolution, humans relied primarily on their own muscle power and animal power.</li>
<li>A human can produce about 100 watts of power daily.</li>
<li>The average South American uses 10 times this amount, while the average North American uses 100 times.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Potential for Further Growth:</strong> It’s conceivable that future technological advancements could significantly increase energy use per capita.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences of the Flatline:</strong> The plateau in energy consumption has contributed to a slowdown in life-improving technologies, including those related to productivity, health, and transportation.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Analysis of Science Fiction Predictions:</strong> Examining the fulfillment of technological predictions from the golden age of science fiction reveals a pattern related to energy intensity.</li>
<li><strong>Correlation with Energy Intensity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Technologies requiring low power levels have generally been fulfilled or even exceeded expectations.</li>
<li>Technologies requiring moderate power levels have seen mixed results, with some fulfilling expectations and others falling short.</li>
<li>Technologies requiring high power levels have consistently failed to meet expectations.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>H.G. Wells</strong> predicted successful airplane flight before the year 2000. (Wells’ Anticipations, Circa 1900)</li>
<li>The scientific community, including astronomer <strong>Simon Newcomb</strong>, largely believed powered, heavier-than-air flight was impossible or at least a million years away. (New York Times, 1903)</li>
<li>Newcomb’s critiques, while ultimately incorrect, highlighted key challenges to be solved, such as:
<ul>
<li><strong>How to stop an airplane traveling at high speeds:</strong> “How is he ever going to stop?” (Newcomb, 1903)
<ul>
<li>Current airplanes use a “kludge” of descending to the ground at flying speed and slowing down on a runway.</li>
<li>This runway requirement prevents airplanes from being practical flying cars.</li>

<section id="the-power-curve-and-energy-management" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-power-curve-and-energy-management">The Power Curve and Energy Management</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The key to flying is energy management.</strong></li>
<li>Airplanes require power to:
<ul>
<li><strong>Generate lift:</strong> Stay aloft.</li>
<li><strong>Overcome drag:</strong> Maintain speed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Three stores of energy</strong> power an airplane:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Provides a few seconds of flight.</li>
<li><strong>Altitude:</strong> Provides a few minutes of flight.</li>
<li><strong>Fuel:</strong> Provides a few hours of flight.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Takeoff, climb, and landing</strong> are phases of managing these energy stores.</li>
<li><strong>Landing</strong> is particularly problematic:
<ul>
<li>Descending directly downwards converts altitude energy into unwanted speed.</li>
<li>Requires a long, slanting approach to bleed off energy.</li>
<li>Airplanes must maintain flying speed until touchdown.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Induced drag</strong> (related to lift) decreases with increasing speed.</li>
<li><strong>Parasitic drag</strong> (related to other air disturbances) increases with increasing speed.</li>
<li>The <strong>power curve</strong> represents the total power needed to fly at different speeds.
<ul>
<li>Flying faster or slower than the optimal speed requires more power.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Birds</strong> can efficiently land because they can:
<ul>
<li>Spread their wings for high lift and high drag.</li>
<li>Flap vigorously to increase lift while slowing down.</li>
<li>Integrate thrust production with lift generation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fixed-wing airplanes</strong> cannot replicate this:
<ul>
<li>Increasing lift with the propeller also increases speed.</li>
<li>This creates a conflict during landing when slowing down is desired.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The closer flight technology can emulate birds, the closer we get to flying cars.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Charles Zimmerman</strong> (NACA) developed the <strong>Flying Pancake</strong> in the 1930s.
<ul>
<li>Goal: Create an airplane that could descend steeply at low speeds for easier landings, eliminating the need for long runways. (Zimmerman, 1932)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Willard R. Custer’s Channel Wing (CCW)</strong> aircraft used <strong>upper surface blowing</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Patented in 1929, flew in the 1940s.</li>
<li>CCW-5:

<li>5 passengers, 2.5 tons, 200 mph cruise speed.</li>
<li>35 mph flight speed, 250-foot takeoff roll.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="juan-de-la-ciervas-innovation">Juan de la Cierva’s Innovation</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Juan de la Cierva</strong> invented the <strong>autogyro</strong> in the early 1920s.
<ul>
<li>Goal: Solve the stall problem by making wings move fast even at low aircraft speeds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Autogyro features:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rotor blades</strong> act as the wing, generating lift.</li>
<li>Separate propeller provides thrust to overcome drag.</li>
<li><strong>Autorotation:</strong> Wind passing through the rotor disc causes the rotors to spin.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Innovations to overcome autogyro challenges:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dissymmetry of lift:</strong> Solved by using <strong>flapping hinges</strong> that allow blades to adjust their angle of attack.
<ul>
<li>Blades on the advancing side flap up, reducing lift; blades on the retreating side flap down, increasing lift.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Centrifugal force</strong> keeps the flapping blades extended outwards.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Development and Refinement:</strong>
<ul>
<li>De la Cierva refined the autogyro throughout the 1920s.</li>
<li><strong>Frank Courtney’s</strong> experience with blade breakage led to the addition of <strong>lead-lag hinges</strong> to accommodate blade acceleration and deceleration.</li>

<section id="waldos-origin-and-concept" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="waldos-origin-and-concept">Waldo’s Origin and Concept</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Robert A. Heinlein</strong>, writing as Anson MacDonald, introduced the <strong>Waldo F. Jones Synchronous Reduplicating Pantograph</strong> in a 1942 Astounding science fiction story.
<ul>
<li>This concept established Heinlein as the <strong>conceptual inventor of the telemanipulator</strong>, often referred to as a <strong>Waldo</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A <strong>Waldo</strong> is essentially a <strong>robot arm controlled remotely by a human operator</strong>, unlike programmed robots.
<ul>
<li><strong>Waldos</strong> emerged in the 1950s, driven by advancements in <strong>cybernetics and control theory</strong>, and the need to handle <strong>radioactive materials</strong> in the burgeoning <strong>nuclear field</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Heinlein’s original <strong>Waldos</strong> had two key features:
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-replicating and reduplicating.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Scale-shifting</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Waldo’s objective</strong> was to operate on individual nerve cells by creating a series of progressively smaller Waldos.
<ul>
<li>Existing tools, like <strong>electromagnetic instruments and neural surgery</strong>, lacked the precision for Waldo’s desired level of investigation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Waldo’s smallest Waldos</strong> at the time had <strong>half-inch palms</strong> and <strong>micro-scanners</strong>.
<ul>
<li>These were still too large for his purpose, leading him to use them to create even tinier Waldos.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Waldo’s final Waldos</strong> for nerve and brain surgery ranged from <strong>life-size mechanical hands</strong> to <strong>tiny “fairy digits”</strong> capable of manipulating objects invisible to the naked eye.
<ul>
<li>These were <strong>mounted in banks</strong> to work on the same area.</li>
<li>Waldo controlled them all from the same <strong>primary controls</strong>, switching sizes without removing his gauntlets.</li>
<li>Circuit changes automatically adjusted the <strong>scanning sweep and magnification</strong>, providing Waldo with a life-size image of his “other hands” in his stereo receiver.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Heinlein briefly addressed the challenge of <strong>visualization at smaller scales</strong> in a science fiction context, but lacked a detailed plan.
<ul>
<li>A more concrete solution would emerge nearly two decades later.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="feynmans-vision-nanotechnologys-genesis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feynmans-vision-nanotechnologys-genesis">Feynman’s Vision: Nanotechnology’s Genesis</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Richard Feynman</strong>, a physics professor at Caltech, likely encountered Heinlein’s Waldo story.
<ul>
<li><strong>Feynman’s academic background</strong> (MIT, Princeton, Los Alamos) placed him in environments with strong science fiction communities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In late 1959, Feynman repurposed the Waldo idea for an after-dinner speech at an <strong>American Physics Society conference</strong>.
<ul>
<li>He <strong>added detailed technological and scientific grounding</strong> to the concept, becoming intrigued by its potential.</li>
<li>This marked Feynman as the <strong>first to envision nanotechnology</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Feynman’s revolutionary insight</strong> led him to predict:
<ul>
<li>“In the year 2000, when they look back at this age, they will wonder why it was not until the year 1960 that anybody began seriously to move in this direction.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Feynman’s prediction was premature.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Serious progress in nanotechnology didn’t begin until the 1990s.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By 2000, <strong>atomic-scale electronic devices</strong> like <strong>molecular transistors</strong> existed, but <strong>complex circuits</strong> like nanocomputers were still 15 years away.</li>
<li>The missing element was the <strong>infrastructure</strong> that macroscopic technology relies on:
<ul>
<li><strong>Sorting and testing parts.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cutting and joining materials.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Creating frameworks for devices.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Placing parts into frameworks.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Feynman’s 1959 talk “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom” outlined a plan that could have achieved this infrastructure by 2000.</strong></li>
</ul>

<section id="feynmans-plan-top-down-approach" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feynmans-plan-top-down-approach">Feynman’s Plan: Top-Down Approach</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feynman’s talk proposed a “weird possibility” inspired by remote manipulators used in nuclear plants:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Build a <strong>master-slave system</strong> operating electrically.</li>
<li>Create <strong>precisely-made slave hands</strong> at one-quarter the scale of the master hands.</li>
<li>Use these smaller hands to manipulate <strong>quarter-sized tools and machines</strong>, including a <strong>quarter-size lathe</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat the process to create <strong>even smaller hands and tools</strong>, at one-sixteenth scale.</li>
<li><strong>Connect the large-scale system to the smallest servo motors</strong> through transformers for control.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Feynman’s core idea</strong> was to <strong>transition from macro-scale to nano-scale fabrication</strong> while maintaining general fabrication and manipulation capabilities, mirroring Waldo’s approach in Heinlein’s story.</li>
<li>Feynman acknowledged the difficulty but emphasized the <strong>possibility</strong> of this approach.</li>
<li>He offered <strong>$1,000 prizes</strong> for a <strong>tiny motor</strong> and <strong>tiny writing</strong>, aiming to stimulate interest.
<ul>
<li>The prizes were won, but <strong>Feynman’s vision failed to gain widespread traction</strong>.</li>

<section id="drexlers-vision-bottom-up-approach" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="drexlers-vision-bottom-up-approach">Drexler’s Vision: Bottom-Up Approach</h3>
<ul>
<li>Around 1976, <strong>K. Eric Drexler</strong>, an MIT undergraduate, envisioned building with <strong>designed protein molecules and other biomolecules</strong>.
<ul>
<li>He observed the <strong>mechanical and electronic functions of cellular components</strong> and questioned if humans could replicate such processes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By 1981, Drexler published a paper in the <strong>Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences</strong>, sparking the formation of a <strong>nanotechnology study group</strong> at MIT.</li>
<li>In 1986, Drexler and his group published <strong>Engines of Creation</strong>, introducing <strong>nanotechnology</strong> to a broader audience.</li>
<li><strong>Drexler’s approach</strong> differed from Feynman’s:
<ul>
<li><strong>Feynman’s was top-down</strong>, starting with machines and scaling down to atoms.</li>
<li><strong>Drexler’s was bottom-up</strong>, starting with biochemistry and scaling up to machines.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Both approaches ultimately aimed for <strong>molecular machines</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Feynman envisioned the physicist <strong>synthesizing anything</strong>.</li>
<li>Drexler described it as <strong>complete control of the structure of matter</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Interpreting these visions requires nuance.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Creating unstable atomic arrangements like exploding dynamite atom-by-atom is not feasible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>A reasonable interpretation</strong> focuses on <strong>rearranging existing atoms</strong>, exemplified by the hamburger analogy:
<ul>
<li>Eating a hamburger rearranges atoms without creating or destroying them.</li>
<li>A <strong>general synthesis capability</strong> would allow for transforming waste products back into the original hamburger.</li>
<li><strong>Current technology achieves this indirectly</strong> through agriculture and food processing.</li>
<li>A <strong>nanotechnological machine</strong> could achieve this directly at the molecular level.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>DNA</strong> has limitations: it cannot describe every possible atomic arrangement, only the linear sequence of amino acids in proteins.
<ul>
<li>However, <strong>amino acids can form diverse molecular machinery</strong>, performing life’s essential functions.</li>
<li>This parallels limitations in macroscopic technology, where machinists can create components but not infinitely complex shapes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Self-replication</strong> was an implicit concept in nanotechnology from the outset:
<ul>
<li>Heinlein explicitly mentioned “reduplicating”.</li>
<li>Feynman adopted this idea.</li>
<li>Drexler’s work stemmed from self-reproducing biological mechanisms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Nanotechnology surpasses limitations of cellular biochemistry</strong>:
<ul>
<li>It can operate <strong>without water</strong>, across a <strong>wider temperature range</strong>, and at <strong>higher speeds and power levels</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nanotechs-potential-incomprehensible-capabilities">Nanotech’s Potential: Incomprehensible Capabilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nanotechnology offers immense potential</strong> due to its ability to rearrange atoms.
<ul>
<li>The difference between <strong>charcoal and diamond, sand and computer chips, diseased and healthy tissue, and even life and death</strong> lies solely in atomic arrangement.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Drexler’s Engines of Creation</strong> paints a <strong>technophile’s dream</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Microscopic replicating units</strong> building <strong>skyscraper-sized objects</strong> with atomic precision.</li>
<li><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> and <strong>complex engineering systems</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Easy space travel</strong> with <strong>lightweight spacesuits</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Cell repair machines</strong> and the <strong>cure for aging</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Cryonics</strong> and <strong>resurrection</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Drexler’s vision</strong> expanded significantly on <strong>Feynman’s initial ideas</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Feynman focused on <strong>data storage</strong> and <strong>chemical synthesis</strong>.</li>
<li>Drexler explored the <strong>broader implications</strong> of “making absolutely anything”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Drexler’s projections</strong> were based on <strong>conservative engineering estimates</strong>.</li>
<li>Despite this, <strong>science fiction writers</strong> took the concept further, often with less scientific accuracy.
<ul>
<li>A 1989 Star Trek episode featured <strong>nanites evolving into an intelligent, coordinated species</strong> in a short timeframe, defying basic scientific principles.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Growing enthusiasm for nanotechnology</strong> led to increased hype and difficulty distinguishing serious research from fictionalized portrayals.</li>
<li>The <strong>technical world’s excitement</strong> was palpable:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Usenet Nanotechnology Discussion Group (Sci.Nanotech)</strong>, founded in 1989, received overwhelming support.</li>
<li>The <strong>first Foresight Conference on Nanotechnology</strong> in 1989 evoked comparisons to the historic <strong>Solvay Conferences</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Drexler’s influence</strong> on nanotechnology’s development in the 1980s and 1990s was substantial, exceeding that of Feynman or Heinlein.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-mightiest-machine-understanding-nanotechs-power">The Mightiest Machine: Understanding Nanotech’s Power</h3>
<ul>
<li>Grasping the <strong>raw power and potential of nanotechnology</strong> can be challenging.</li>
<li><strong>Drexler’s Nanosystems</strong> highlights the <strong>immense power density of nanomotors</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Greater than 10^15 watts per cubic meter</strong>.</li>
<li>For comparison, Earth receives about 10^17 watts of solar radiation.</li>
<li><strong>Cooling limitations</strong> prevent sustained operation at this density.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>This implies</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A <strong>1,000 horsepower (10^6 watts) engine</strong> could fit in a <strong>1 millimeter cube (10^-9 cubic meters)</strong>.</li>
<li>One cubic foot of nanomotors would require more power (10^13 watts) than all human machinery combined.</li>
<li>A <strong>Kardashev Type I civilization’s power needs (10^17 watts)</strong> could be met by nanomotors fitting in a 500-square-foot apartment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Jetsons’ world</strong> becomes more realistic than traditional futurism:
<ul>
<li><strong>Microscopic motors</strong> would be ubiquitous, seamlessly moving objects like biological muscles.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Miniaturization and speed</strong> are key advantages of nanotechnology:
<ul>
<li><strong>Smaller machines can operate faster</strong>, similar to the trend in electronics.</li>
<li><strong>Birds and insects</strong> demonstrate this principle with wing flapping speeds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Factory throughput</strong> is crucial for productivity:
<ul>
<li>A factory processing materials at walking speed (5 feet per second) across a mile takes 20 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Scaling down to cell size (microns)</strong> reduces processing time to <strong>microseconds</strong>.</li>
<li>This explains the <strong>vast difference in reproduction speeds</strong> between humans (20 years) and E. coli (20 minutes).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reproduction speed impacts economic growth</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A factory with a 3% annual return on investment takes 33 years to recoup its cost.</li>
<li><strong>Reinventing profits</strong> accelerates growth through <strong>compound interest</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Self-replicating factories</strong> dramatically change the equation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Replacing the US capital stock with mature nanotechnology</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Estimated time: <strong>about a week</strong>, based on calculations by Robert Freitas and the author.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This seemingly outlandish claim is supported by <strong>Nanosystems</strong> and <strong>molecular manufacturing research</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Analogy with information technology</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>power and sophistication of modern computers</strong> would seem “fantastic, ludicrous, insane” to someone from the 1960s.</li>
<li>The <strong>IBM 7094</strong>, used by NASA, had 0.35 MIPS and cost $35 million in today’s dollars.</li>
<li>A <strong>$35 Raspberry Pi</strong> in 2015 had 9,700 MIPS.</li>
<li>The author’s workstation has 2,356,230 MIPS.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Similar exponential advancements are possible with matter and energy manipulation</strong> through nanotechnology.</li>

<li><strong>Nanotech</strong> is a <strong>digital technology</strong>, distinct from <strong>nanotechnology</strong> (nanoscale surface and material science).</li>
<li><strong>Atomically precise machines</strong> that build more atomically precise machines create a <strong>digital matter escalator</strong>, analogous to digital information technology.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware becomes secondary to design</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In software, <strong>hardware advancements (Moore’s Law)</strong> outpaced software complexity.</li>
<li>In nanotech, <strong>physics (the abundance of atoms)</strong> is the substrate, and <strong>machine design (the software)</strong> is the bottleneck.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The challenge lies in designing self-constructing machines in digital matter</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Rebuilding America physically in a week</strong> highlights the need for efficient design processes.</li>
<li><strong>Biotechnology</strong> is currently the only field manipulating matter digitally, following nature’s lead.</li>
<li>Within decades, we will create machines capable of <strong>making anything</strong>, similar to 3D printers but with atomic precision and diverse materials.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>February 1985</strong>: Kevin Ashley, a graduate student, witnessed the aftermath of an experiment in the electrochemistry lab at the University of Utah.
<ul>
<li>The lab was in disarray, with dust in the air.</li>
<li>A hole was found in the lab bench and the concrete floor beneath it.</li>
<li><strong>Stanley Pons</strong> and <strong>Martin Fleischmann</strong> appeared surprised by the results.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pons and Fleischmann’s Belief</strong>: They believed they achieved <strong>deuterium fusion</strong> within an electrochemical beaker.
<ul>
<li>They invested significant personal funds ($100,000, equivalent to $250,000 today) in further research.</li>
<li>Their hypothesis, if true, would have revolutionized energy production.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reality Check</strong>: The energy release, if it were truly fusion, would have been lethal and caused widespread radiation.
<ul>
<li>Their experiments over the next four years yielded inconsistent results.
<ul>
<li>Massive heat releases were infrequent.</li>
<li>More often, nothing happened.</li>
<li>Occasional bursts of heat, sometimes exceeding the input energy by tenfold, were observed after prolonged deuterium loading of a palladium electrode.</li>
<li>These bursts were unpredictable in their onset and duration.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Assessment of Pons and Fleischmann</strong>:

<ul>
<li><strong>1989</strong>: Events unfolded that led to a premature public announcement.
<ul>
<li>Pons and Fleischmann sought funding from the University of Utah.</li>
<li>The university was interested in potential patent rights.</li>
<li><strong>Steve Jones</strong>, a physicist at Brigham Young University, was working on <strong>muon-catalyzed fusion (MCF)</strong>.
<ul>
<li><strong>MCF</strong> is a known phenomenon in standard physics.</li>
<li>It involves the fusion of deuterium nuclei facilitated by muons (particles similar to electrons but heavier).</li>
<li><strong>MCF</strong> is not a practical energy source due to the energy cost of muon creation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The University of Utah, fearing loss of patent priority, pressured Pons and Fleischmann to announce their findings.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>March 1989</strong>: A press conference was held, and a preliminary paper titled “Electrochemically Induced Nuclear Fusion of Deuterium” was published.
<ul>
<li>Fleischmann expressed reservations about this hasty approach, preferring to delay publication.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Media Frenzy and Scientific Controversy</strong>: The announcement sparked intense media attention and a strong reaction from the scientific community.

<ul>
<li><strong>Parallels with “The Skylark of Space”</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Both the fictional X and palladium are rare platinum group metals.</li>
<li>Both involve energy release through electrolysis.</li>
<li>In the novel, the fictional scientist Seton faces disbelief, theft, assassination attempts, and the abduction of his fiancée.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Machiavelli Effect in Science</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Richard Feynman</strong> emphasized the importance of admitting ignorance and uncertainty for scientific progress.</li>
<li><strong>Niccolo Machiavelli</strong>, in “The Prince” (1532), described the challenges faced by innovators who threaten the established order.
<ul>
<li>Innovators face strong opposition from those who benefit from the status quo and lukewarm support from potential beneficiaries.</li>
<li>This resistance can endanger the innovator and their supporters.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Evidence of the Machiavelli Effect in Cold Fusion</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Scientists with ties to <strong>hot fusion</strong> research were particularly critical of cold fusion.</li>
<li>The <strong>Department of Energy (DOE)</strong> formed a committee (<strong>ERAB</strong>) to investigate cold fusion in April 1989.
<ul>
<li>The committee leadership had strong connections to nuclear weapons research.</li>
<li>The report, while not entirely dismissive, was interpreted as such.</li>
<li><strong>John Huizenga</strong> wrote a book debunking cold fusion, leveraging his position as committee chairman.</li>
<li>The report acknowledged the impossibility of definitively proving or disproving all claims.</li>
<li>It listed 11 positive and 13 negative experiments for excess heat.</li>
<li>At least one credible positive result from NASA was overlooked.</li>
<li>A later positive result from the Naval Air Warfare Center was initially listed as negative.</li>
<li>The evidence for excess heat was arguably balanced, if not slightly favoring cold fusion.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Role of Politics and Funding</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Superconducting Supercollider (SSC)</strong> project was competing for funding at the time.</li>
<li>Cold fusion posed a potential threat to the SSC’s funding and the prestige of high-energy physics.</li>
<li>The <strong>Machiavelli effect</strong> explains the biased reaction, as the scientific establishment sought to protect its interests.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Examples of Bias</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center</strong> reported no excess heat, but their experimental setup was flawed.
<ul>
<li><strong>Peter Hagelstein</strong> pointed out the significantly higher measurement errors in the MIT experiments compared to Fleischmann and Pons’s work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The emotional and dismissive language used by some scientists against cold fusion proponents further suggests bias.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Impact of the ERAB Report</strong>:
<ul>
<li>By November 1989, the scientific community largely dismissed cold fusion.</li>
<li>Fleischmann and Pons’s detailed paper was published only then, making proper replication attempts possible.</li>
<li>The <strong>Machiavelli effect</strong> was in full force, hindering further research.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Continued Suppression of Research</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Hagelstein’s experience with a company interested in funding cold fusion research demonstrates ongoing resistance.
<ul>
<li>A prominent physicist at MIT intervened, canceling the program and jeopardizing the careers of researchers involved.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Implications of the Machiavelli Effect</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The attacks on cold fusion may not have been solely based on scientific merit.</li>
<li>There is a high prior probability of bias due to the political and financial stakes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenges in Cold Fusion Research</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The field is plagued by unreliable claims from less credible sources.</li>
<li>Replication is difficult, increasing the risk of self-deception among researchers.</li>
<li>Cold fusion is often associated with pseudoscience and fringe ideas, further damaging its reputation.</li>
<li>The constant barrage of unsubstantiated claims makes it difficult for scientists to differentiate potentially valid research.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Exploring the Impossible</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Arthur C. Clarke</strong>: “The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.”</li>
<li>Many scientific and technological advancements resulted from challenging established limits.</li>

<section id="aftermath-and-current-status" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="aftermath-and-current-status">Aftermath and Current Status</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lessons Learned</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Fleischmann and Pons’s focus on fusion products, an area outside their expertise, made them vulnerable to criticism.</li>
<li>They should have emphasized the observed heat amplification instead.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The National Cold Fusion Institute</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Founded at the University of Utah with $4.5 million in funding.</li>
<li>Failed to produce significant results and closed within a year.</li>
<li>Legal disputes surrounding the institute cost five times more than the research itself.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Further Research Efforts</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Toyota invested $40 million in Fleischmann and Pons’s research at IMRA Europe, with limited success.</li>
<li>Japan’s MITI spent $20 million, also with no breakthroughs.</li>
<li>These efforts did lead to a gradual improvement in producing the effect, but reliability remained elusive.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Difficulties in Replication</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Richard Oriani</strong> described cold fusion experiments as the most challenging of his career.</li>
<li>Replication remains extremely difficult, requiring specific conditions and materials.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Progress in Understanding</strong>:
<ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Thomas Kuhn</strong>, in “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,” argues that members of mature scientific communities are victims of history rewritten by those in power.
<ul>
<li>Similar to characters in Orwell’s “1984.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By 1989, the consensus was that <strong>cold fusion</strong> was a mistake due to misinterpretations and poor lab techniques.</li>
<li>The author initially accepted this consensus.</li>
<li>Decades later, after encountering the <strong>Machiavelli Effect</strong> in <strong>nanotechnology</strong>, the author reconsidered cold fusion.</li>

<ul>
<li>The resistance to innovation in nanotechnology was less intense than in cold fusion.</li>
<li><strong>Nanotechnology</strong> gained prominence in the 1990s.
<ul>
<li><strong>Eric Drexler</strong>’s 1991 MIT dissertation, the first explicitly on nanotechnology, provided a theoretical basis for its manufacturing capabilities.</li>
<li>Republished as “Nanosystems” in 1992, it became a bestseller.</li>
<li>The Foresight Institute’s nanotechnology conferences grew, attracting top researchers.</li>
<li><strong>Richard Feynman</strong>’s “Plenty of Room” (1960) gained recognition in the late 1990s.</li>
<li>In 1997, Nobel laureate <strong>Richard Smalley</strong> (discoverer of C60) was the Foresight Institute’s keynote speaker.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By 2000, nanotechnology gained political attention.
<ul>
<li>President Clinton proposed a <strong>National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI)</strong>, citing Feynman’s work.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="machiavellis-two-classes-the-nni">Machiavelli’s Two Classes &amp; The NNI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Machiavelli</strong> identified two classes:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Nobles:</strong> Those who benefit from the status quo and have the laws on their side. They tend to be politically and economically powerful.</li>
<li><strong>Tradesmen:</strong> Those who would benefit from innovation but fear the risks associated with challenging the nobles.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The NNI did not introduce new funding but redistributed existing funds, creating a Machiavelli Effect scenario.
<ul>
<li><strong>Nobles:</strong> Established researchers in related fields (e.g., surface and materials science).</li>
<li><strong>Tradesmen:</strong> Researchers who could potentially work on true nanotech but were working in other areas or were still students.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Nobles’ Reaction:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Labeled their existing work as nanotechnology.</li>
<li>Attacked Drexler’s (and implicitly Feynman’s) vision.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Tradesmen’s Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hesitated to embrace the new field due to its perceived difficulty and the risk of attacks from established researchers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consequences:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Innovation slowed down.</li>
<li>This dynamic is common in zero-sum science and technology funding environments.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-machiavelli-effect-as-a-systemic-immune-response">The Machiavelli Effect as a Systemic Immune Response</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Machiavelli Effect is not a conspiracy but a natural human response to protect one’s interests.</li>
<li>It’s akin to a <strong>social and economic system’s immune response</strong>.</li>
<li>It’s a part of <strong>normal science</strong> as described by Thomas Kuhn.</li>
<li><strong>Isaac Asimov</strong> observed similar resistance to technological change throughout history:
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I discovered, to my amazement, that all through history there had been resistance, and bitter, exaggerated, last-ditch resistance, to every significant technological change that had taken place on Earth. Usually, the resistance came from those groups who stood to lose influence, status, money as a result of the change. Although they never advanced this as their reason for resisting it, it was always the good of humanity that rested upon their hearts.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>By the early 2000s, the NNI led to a full-fledged Machiavelli Effect in nanotechnology.
<ul>
<li>Researchers working on molecular machines faced funding difficulties due to partisan attacks.</li>
<li>A productive nanotech program at NASA Ames was canceled.</li>
<li>Foresight Institute experienced difficulty attracting researchers who had previously presented work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The attacks lacked intellectual substance.
<ul>
<li>Smalley, a prominent attacker, contradicted himself on the feasibility of molecular self-replication.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Machiavelli’s prediction of the 20th-century behavior of nanoscience leaders does not invalidate nanotechnology itself.</li>
<li>It highlights the possibility of partisan influence in attacks on new ideas.</li>
<li>In Bayesian terms, the prior probability of such attacks was high regardless of the validity of Drexler’s or Feynman’s vision.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-machiavelli-effect-beyond-physical-science">The Machiavelli Effect Beyond Physical Science</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Machiavelli Effect is not limited to physical sciences and engineering.</li>
<li>It’s arguably less prevalent in these fields compared to others.</li>
<li><strong>George Miller</strong> (cognitive psychologist) described the difficulty of challenging behaviorism’s dominance in psychology:
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The power, the honors, the authority, the textbooks, the money, everything in psychology was owned by the behavioristic school. Those of us who wanted to be scientific psychologists couldn’t really oppose it. You just wouldn’t get a job.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Distinguishing between the Machiavelli Effect and legitimate criticism of flawed ideas can be challenging.</li>
<li><strong>Textbook knowledge</strong> is generally “probably approximately correct.”</li>
<li>But in some cases (e.g., flying machines), expert consensus has been wrong.</li>
<li>The bureaucratic resistance to innovators can be detrimental to scientific progress.</li>

<ul>
<li>In 1910, the Wright brothers offered their <strong>Wright Flyer</strong> (the first successful heavier-than-air flying machine) to the Smithsonian.</li>
<li>Their offer was rejected.</li>
<li>The Flyer was eventually donated to the Science Museum in London (until 1948).</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the Smithsonian exhibited <strong>Samuel Langley</strong>’s <strong>Aerodrome</strong> as the first flying machine.
<ul>
<li>Langley, a former Smithsonian director, had received significant government funding for his failed attempts at flight.</li>
<li>In 1914, the Smithsonian lent the Aerodrome to <strong>Glenn Curtiss</strong>, who modified and successfully flew it.</li>
<li>Curtiss was a competitor of the Wrights and sought to invalidate their airplane patent.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Funding Disparity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Wrights spent about $1,000 of their own money to build the Flyer.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-public-good-of-basic-research-funding-trends">The Public Good of Basic Research &amp; Funding Trends</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scientists generally believe that <strong>basic research</strong> is a <strong>public good</strong>, providing broad benefits that outweigh its costs.
<ul>
<li>Its benefits are so widespread that no individual has a private incentive to fund it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author initially shared this belief and conducted federally funded research.</li>
<li>Research funding trends fluctuate (e.g., the <strong>AI winter</strong> in the 1980s).</li>
<li>The author initially assumed funding agencies simply misunderstood the potential of certain fields.</li>
<li>The nanotechnology experience changed the author’s perspective.</li>
<li>The deliberate distortion of nanotech’s core concept (as envisioned by Heinlein, Feynman, and Drexler) raised doubts about the top-down funding process’s ability to advance science, technology, and society.</li>
<li><strong>Government Funding and Innovation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The $50,000 Langley received for the Aerodrome was exceptional before 1940.</li>
<li>The <strong>Manhattan Project</strong> (billions of dollars, massive industrial effort, successful outcome) changed perceptions about government-funded research.</li>
<li>Its success and the subsequent advancements in aircraft and missile research convinced many that federal funding could accelerate scientific progress and economic growth.</li>
<li>Defense research funding became entrenched.</li>
<li>Non-defense research spending increased in the 1960s, primarily for the space program.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Private Sector Innovation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Major quality-of-life improvements before 1960 (refrigerators, freezers, vacuum cleaners, stoves, washing machines, indoor plumbing, detergents, electric lights, cars, trucks, tractors, fertilizer, air travel, containerized freight, vacuum tubes, transistors, telegraph, telephone, phonograph, movies, radio, television) were primarily developed privately.</li>

<ul>
<li>The belief that increased federal funding for scientific research would boost economic growth became widespread.</li>
<li><strong>Evidence Against This Belief:</strong>
<ul>
<li>England, where the Industrial Revolution began, had minimal public research support in the 19th century.</li>
<li>France and Germany, with strong public scientific enterprises, did not experience comparable economic growth.</li>
<li>The US, with a laissez-faire approach, surpassed Britain’s GDP per capita.</li>
<li>Public R&amp;D funding coincided with the <strong>Great Stagnation</strong>, a period of slowed technological innovation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>OECD Study (2005):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Found a positive correlation (0.26) between private R&amp;D and economic growth.</li>
<li>Found a negative correlation (-0.37) between government-funded R&amp;D and economic growth.</li>
<li>Authors suggested that public R&amp;D might <strong>crowd out</strong> private sector resources, including private R&amp;D.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Crowding Out vs.&nbsp;The Machiavelli Effect:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some economists (e.g., Terence Keeley) favor the crowding-out explanation.</li>
<li>The author argues that the Machiavelli Effect also plays a significant role.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Counterarguments to Cowen’s Hypothesis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The decline in manufacturing jobs continued well into the 2000s, freeing up workers for other sectors.</li>
<li>The US consistently produces more manufactured goods with fewer workers.</li>
<li>There is significant potential for increased production (e.g., flying cars) if desired.</li>
<li>The <strong>feminist revolution</strong> doubled the pool of educated young people.</li>
<li>Women’s participation in higher education increased significantly (e.g., PhDs awarded to women).</li>
<li>PhDs awarded per year increased dramatically compared to the 1950s and early 20th century.</li>

<li><strong>Ivory Tower Syndrome Hypothesis:</strong>

<li>Suggests that excessive education might hinder the economy and technological innovation.</li>
<li>Too many young people are in academia instead of pursuing real-world endeavors.</li>

<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“But there’s a tension here that Tyler doesn’t address. Technology grew like gangbusters in the first half of the 20th century, but it wasn’t until the second half that education took off.

<ul>
<li><strong>Arthur C. Clarke</strong> (“Profiles of the Future”) identified two types of failure in technological forecasting:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Failure of Nerve:</strong> Occurs when the science and engineering are understood, but the predicted outcome is too unconventional.
<ul>
<li>Example: The scientific community’s denial of heavier-than-air flight (even after the Wright brothers’ success).</li>
<li><strong>Simon Newcomb</strong>’s argument against airplanes (falling out of the sky when they stopped) exemplifies a failure of nerve.</li>
<li>He failed to consider the possibility of runways for takeoff and landing.</li>
<li><strong>Arthur C. Clarke</strong> encountered similar resistance in the field of rocketry.</li>
<li><strong>New York Times Editorial (1920):</strong>
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“That Professor Goddard, with his chair in Clark College and the countenancing of the Smithsonian Institution, does not know the relation of action and reaction, and of the need to have something better than a vacuum against which to react, to say that would be absurd. Of course, he only seems to lack the knowledge ladled out daily in high schools.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The editorial displays arrogance and ignorance.</li>
<li>It illustrates the potential for influential figures to stifle innovation through biased funding decisions.</li>
<li>The Times retracted the claim in 1969 during the Apollo 11 mission:
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Isaac Newton in the 17th century, and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere. The Times regrets the error.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Nanotechnology as a Modern Example:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Standard physics, chemistry, and quantum mechanics predict the feasibility of atomically precise machines.</li>
<li>The failure of nerve is essentially thinking within limitations that do not actually exist.</li>
<li><strong>Feynman</strong>’s breakthrough was recognizing the potential of manipulating matter at the atomic level.</li>
<li><strong>Drexler</strong> further weakened the resistance by drawing parallels with molecular machines in cells.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Failure of Imagination:</strong> Occurs when the knowledge required to make accurate predictions is simply unavailable.
<ul>
<li>Example: <strong>Ernest Rutherford</strong>’s dismissal of atomic energy:
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The energy produced by the breaking down of the atom is a very poor kind of thing. Anyone who expects a source of power from transformation of these atoms is talking moonshine.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rutherford, a leading nuclear physicist, was unaware of the neutron and nuclear fission, concepts that were unknown at the time.</li>
<li>Failures of imagination are difficult to identify except in hindsight.</li>
<li>It’s essential to acknowledge the existence of unknown unknowns.</li>
<li>Technological progress often involves venturing beyond the known.</li>
<li><strong>Crystal Radio Example:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Someone familiar with crystal radios might have envisioned the transistor, not through knowledge of quantum mechanics, but by recognizing the possibility of undiscovered solid-state phenomena.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The 17th-century Scientific Revolution:</strong> Isaac Newton’s discoveries in motion, gravitation, and calculus built upon the work of previous scientists, marking a shift in understanding the universe from anthropomorphic gods to logic, mathematics, observation, and experiment.</li>
<li><strong>The Beauty and Value of Science:</strong> Science builds upon itself, incorporating insights from previous generations, unlike other forms of knowledge.
<ul>
<li>Example: Ptolemy’s epicycles predicted planetary positions, while Newton’s celestial mechanics allowed for the discovery of Neptune based on observations of Uranus.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Scientific and Technological Progress until the 1960s:</strong> Knowledge and capabilities continued to grow, culminating in the moon landing, driven by celestial mechanics and Newton’s third law.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="maslows-hierarchy-of-needs-and-the-cultural-shift">Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs and the Cultural Shift</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs as an Explanation:</strong> Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs can help explain the cultural shift of the 1960s.
<ul>
<li><strong>Hierarchy Levels:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Basic needs: Physical safety, food, clothing, shelter.</li>
<li>Social needs: Friendship, status.</li>
<li>Higher needs: Spiritual fulfillment, self-actualization.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Motivation and Hierarchy:</strong> Individuals are motivated by the lowest unmet need in the hierarchy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Western Culture’s Fulfillment of Lower-Level Needs:</strong> By the 1960s, Western culture had largely fulfilled the basic needs of its citizens, allowing them to focus on higher-level needs.</li>
<li><strong>The Modern Elite and Higher-Level Needs:</strong> The “modern elite” could take basic needs for granted and focus on love, esteem, self-actualization, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Emancipation of Women and Technological Advancements:</strong> Labor-saving machines of the 20th century freed women from some domestic drudgery, allowing them to pursue other interests.
<ul>
<li>Example: The character of Stella in “The Jetsons” (1962) represented this shift, although it was still emerging at the time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rising Productivity and the “Good Life”:</strong> Increased productivity throughout the 19th and 20th centuries led to a higher standard of living, making the “good life” accessible to more people.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-decline-of-evolutionary-pressure-and-the-rise-of-the-eloi">The Decline of Evolutionary Pressure and the Rise of the Eloi</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medieval Europe and the Constant Threat of War:</strong> Medieval life was shaped by the constant presence of war, creating an evolutionary pressure for moral codes that prioritized productivity, efficiency, hard work, and the needs of the polity over the individual.</li>
<li><strong>The Forging of Western Civilization:</strong> This pressure shaped Western civilization, promoting values that led to a better standard of living and the development of science.</li>
<li><strong>The Impact of Nuclear Weapons on Warfare:</strong> The advent of nuclear weapons and the concept of mutually assured destruction (MAD) fundamentally changed the nature of warfare.
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-Circuiting the Evolutionary Process:</strong> MAD removed the pressure on societies to maintain efficient cultural and governmental practices for survival.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Nuclear Umbrella and the Cambrian Explosion of Eloi:</strong> The nuclear umbrella allowed societies with less efficient practices to survive, leading to a proliferation of “Eloi” (those focused on higher-level needs).</li>
<li><strong>Proxy Wars and Reduced Societal Pressure:</strong> Wars like the Korean War became proxy conflicts, reducing the direct pressure on American society compared to World War II.</li>
<li><strong>Peter Turchin’s Historical Analysis:</strong> Historian Peter Turchin observed a pattern of empires becoming complacent and vulnerable to internal decay when their survival is no longer threatened.</li>
<li><strong>The Vietnam War and the Decline of Technological Optimism:</strong> The Vietnam War, perceived as cruel and useless, contributed to a decline in American faith in technological progress and military strength.</li>
<li><strong>World War II’s Influence on Post-War Culture:</strong> The experience of World War II shaped American culture and institutions, promoting a belief in centralized bureaucratic government and fostering a cooperative spirit.</li>
<li><strong>The Unsustainability of the 1950s Boom:</strong> The post-war boom of the 1950s relied on the cooperative spirit inherited from the war, which began to fade in subsequent generations.</li>
<li><strong>The Baby Boomers and the Two Cultures:</strong> The baby boomer generation split into two distinct cultures with differing values and worldviews, exemplified by the contrasting responses to the Apollo 11 moon landing and Woodstock.</li>
<li><strong>The Corporate State and the Age of Aquarius:</strong> The centralized corporate state that worked with the cooperative Greatest Generation struggled to adapt to the individualistic and rebellious spirit of the Age of Aquarius.</li>
<li><strong>Science Fiction’s Misjudgment of Societal Progress:</strong> Science fiction writers often assumed that social decision-making would become more scientific and rational, failing to anticipate the cultural shift towards emotionalism and individualism.</li>
<li><strong>The Role of Ease and Plenty in Moral and Intellectual Decay:</strong> Contrary to some post-apocalyptic narratives, it was ease and abundance, not hardship, that fostered moral and intellectual decline.</li>
<li><strong>The Limitations of War as a Shaper of Culture:</strong> War is no longer a viable mechanism for shaping culture due to the destructive potential of modern technology.</li>
<li><strong>The Question of Corrective Mechanisms for False Beliefs:</strong> In the absence of war, it is unclear what mechanisms will correct societal false beliefs.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-eloi-agonists-and-the-search-for-meaning">The Eloi Agonists and the Search for Meaning</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Modern Eloi’s Perception of Struggle:</strong> Despite living in relative ease and security, many people today perceive their lives as a struggle and believe they are contributing to something meaningful.</li>
<li><strong>Maslow’s Hierarchy and the Need for Belonging and Esteem:</strong> The need for belonging and esteem drives individuals to seek purpose and validation in their lives.</li>
<li><strong>The Human Psyche’s Resistance to Uselessness:</strong> Humans are psychologically averse to a life devoid of purpose and contribution to others, as depicted in Wells’ portrayal of the Eloi.</li>
<li><strong>The Post-Industrial Age’s Fulfillment of the Need for Meaning:</strong> The post-industrial age has created a system where people can believe they are doing important work even when it is not objectively productive.</li>
<li><strong>The Illusion of Progress and Societal Stagnation:</strong> While the Great Stagnation indicates a decline in actual progress, many believe they are making the world a better place.</li>
<li><strong>The Shift from Conquering the Physical World to Conquering Minds:</strong> The focus has shifted from technological advancement to influencing the beliefs and behaviors of others.</li>
<li><strong>The Role of Emotion and Self-Deception:</strong> In this new struggle, objective truth is often disregarded in favor of emotional appeals and self-deception.</li>
<li><strong>The Evolutionary Basis for Self-Deception:</strong> Humans have evolved the ability to deceive themselves as a means of more effectively deceiving others.
<ul>
<li><strong>Research on Self-Deception:</strong> The work of Robert Trivers and Robin Hanson highlights the evolutionary advantages of self-deception.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Literature’s Exploration of Self-Deception:</strong> The theme of self-deception and hypocrisy is prevalent in literature, showcasing our tendency to distort reality to maintain a positive self-image.
<ul>
<li>Example: T.S. Eliot’s observation about people’s desire to feel important and their capacity for self-justification.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Rise of Science and the Advantage of Truth:</strong> Science emerged because, in specific historical contexts, knowing the objective truth became more advantageous than not knowing it.</li>
<li><strong>The Rise of Virtue Signaling and Cost Disease:</strong> Today, many social institutions gain prestige through virtue signaling rather than demonstrable results, leading to cost disease in areas like healthcare, education, and environmental regulation.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="risk-homeostasis-and-the-appeal-of-scare-stories">Risk Homeostasis and the Appeal of Scare Stories</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Homeostasis and Risk Compensation:</strong> People tend to maintain a constant level of perceived risk, adjusting their behavior to compensate for changes in actual risk.
<ul>
<li><strong>The Peltzman Effect:</strong> Introducing safety features can lead to riskier behavior, as people compensate to maintain their preferred risk level.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Societal Risk Homeostasis and the Appeal of Scare Stories:</strong> The decline in perceived exogenous risk after World War II may have led to increased susceptibility to scare stories, such as those related to environmental hazards.</li>
<li><strong>The Correlation between Energy Intensity and Failed Predictions:</strong> Technologies with higher energy intensity are easier to portray as dangerous and are further removed from everyday experience, making them more susceptible to scare stories.
<ul>
<li>Example: Cell phones vs.&nbsp;nuclear reactors – personal experience with cell phones counteracts scare stories, while the lack of experience with nuclear power makes it easier to believe exaggerated risks.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-green-religion-and-the-demonization-of-humanity">The Green Religion and the Demonization of Humanity</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Rise of Environmentalism as a Religion:</strong> The decline of organized religion has been accompanied by the rise of environmentalism, which, in its extreme form, can be considered a religion.
<ul>
<li><strong>John Burroughs’ Observation:</strong> Burroughs noted the increasing tendency to treat nature as a temple.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Homeostasis in the Human Psyche for Religion:</strong> The human psyche appears to have a need for religious or spiritual belief systems, which environmentalism may be fulfilling for some.</li>
<li><strong>Bill McKibben’s Biocentrism:</strong> McKibben’s writings express a biocentric worldview, where human impact on nature is inherently bad, regardless of observable consequences.
<ul>
<li><strong>“The End of Nature”:</strong> McKibben lamented the loss of nature’s independence and mystery due to human influence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Doctrine of Original Sin on Steroids:</strong> This view can be seen as an extreme version of the doctrine of original sin, where humanity’s very existence is seen as a blight on nature.</li>
<li><strong>Calls for Human Extinction:</strong> Some environmental extremists advocate for human extinction as a solution to environmental problems.
<ul>
<li>Example: David Graeber’s hope for a virus to eliminate humanity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Green Religion’s Dominance in Western Culture:</strong> The green religion has become the default belief system for many in Western civilization, particularly in academia.</li>
<li><strong>Climate Change as the Central Focus:</strong> Climate change has become the central apocalyptic narrative of the green religion.</li>
<li><strong>The Intertwining of Environmentalism and a Desire for a Healthy Environment:</strong> It is important to distinguish between a reasonable desire for a clean environment and the religious aspects of the green movement.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-climate-change-debate-science-vs.-religion">The Climate Change Debate: Science vs.&nbsp;Religion</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Fundamentalist Green View of Humanity:</strong> Fundamentalist greens view human impact on nature as inherently negative, regardless of the specific activity.</li>
<li><strong>The Eloi Agonists and Climate Change:</strong> Many climate change believers are not scientists but are motivated by moral and social factors, attaching a sense of moral superiority to their beliefs.</li>
<li><strong>The Author’s Position on Climate Change:</strong> The author distinguishes between green activism, which is largely religious, and the scientific study of climate change.</li>
<li><strong>The Apocalyptic Nature Cult:</strong> A significant portion of the American public believes climate change poses an existential threat to humanity, reflecting an apocalyptic worldview.</li>
<li><strong>The IPCC’s Assessment of Climate Change’s Economic Impact:</strong> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that the economic impact of climate change will be relatively small compared to other factors.</li>
<li><strong>The Disconnect between Scientific Consensus and Public Perception:</strong> There is a vast gap between the IPCC’s scientific assessment and the apocalyptic narrative promoted by climate activists.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="baptists-and-bootleggers-the-political-economy-of-climate-change">Baptists and Bootleggers: The Political Economy of Climate Change</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Baptists and Bootleggers Analogy:</strong> The climate change debate can be understood through the “Baptists and bootleggers” framework from public choice theory, where seemingly opposed groups support the same policies for different reasons.</li>
<li><strong>The Dark Green Religion and Climate Science:</strong> The dark green true believers, like the Baptists, are motivated by moral and religious convictions, while scientists and renewable energy entrepreneurs, like the bootleggers, may benefit from climate concern.</li>
<li><strong>The Reversal of the Baptists and Bootleggers Dynamic:</strong> Unlike the original analogy, where bootleggers pretended to be Baptists, in the climate change debate, the Baptists (dark green activists) often pretend to be bootleggers (scientists) to gain wider support.</li>
<li><strong>The Distortion of Scientific Findings:</strong> This dynamic can lead to the exaggeration of climate change’s risks and the suppression of dissenting scientific views.</li>
<li><strong>The Negative Impacts of Agriculture and Highways on Habitat:</strong> The author notes that agriculture and highways are major contributors to habitat destruction, but these are often overlooked in favor of focusing on energy production.</li>
<li><strong>The Paradox of Opposition to Nuclear Power:</strong> The green movement’s opposition to nuclear power, a clean energy source, is paradoxical given their concern for habitat destruction.</li>
<li><strong>The Prevalence of “Schrodinger’s Cats”:</strong> The author suggests that many individuals hold contradictory beliefs, supporting green causes while also engaging in activities that harm the environment.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ergophobia-the-irrational-fear-of-energy">Ergophobia: The Irrational Fear of Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ergophobia: The Fear of Work/Energy:</strong> Ergophobia is the irrational fear of work, which can be extended to mean the fear of using energy.</li>
<li><strong>The Origins of Ergophobia:</strong> Ergophobia in American culture predates climate change concerns, as seen in the anti-nuclear power movement.</li>
<li><strong>The Climate Movement as a Repackaged Crusade Against Energy:</strong> The modern climate change movement can be seen as a continuation of the anti-energy crusade, using climate change as a justification.</li>
<li><strong>The Contradiction of Opposing Nuclear Power While Fearing Climate Change:</strong> The green movement’s opposition to nuclear power, a carbon-free energy source, is a central contradiction within their ideology.</li>
<li><strong>The Assumption that Anything Human is Bad:</strong> The fundamentalist green perspective seems to stem from the belief that any human impact on nature is inherently negative.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Xhosa Cattle Killing:</strong> The Xhosa cattle killing of 1856-57 serves as an example of a meme plague, where a self-destructive belief spreads rapidly through a population, leading to devastating consequences.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Social Feedback and Suppression of Doubt:</strong> The Xhosa example highlights how social feedback, superstition, and the suppression of skepticism can lead to the adoption of harmful beliefs.</li>
<li><strong>Meme Plagues and Societal Stagnation:</strong> In modern societies, meme plagues may not cause catastrophic collapse but can contribute to societal stagnation.</li>
<li><strong>Eric Hoffer’s Observation on Mass Movements:</strong> Hoffer noted that mass movements in America tend to evolve into rackets, cults, or corporations.</li>
<li><strong>The Eloi-Machiavelli Effect Dynamic:</strong> The Eloi agonists’ crusades, driven by religious fervor, can gain widespread acceptance and be exploited by those seeking power or profit.</li>
<li><strong>Evolutionary Game Theory and Morality:</strong> Evolutionary game theory suggests that morality arises from non-zero-sum interactions, where cooperation benefits all parties.</li>
<li><strong>The Zero-Sum Mentality and the Erosion of Morality:</strong> In a static, no-growth society, the zero-sum mentality prevails, leading to a decline in cooperation and morality.</li>
<li><strong>The Green Religion’s Zero-Sum Approach:</strong> The green religion’s focus on limiting human impact can promote a zero-sum worldview, hindering progress and fostering conflict.</li>
<li><strong>The Corruption of Science by Zero-Sum Politics:</strong> Zero-sum political funding can bias scientific research, promoting agendas rather than objective truth.</li>
<li><strong>The Fragility of Science and the Resurgence of Religion:</strong> The author argues that science is not the default human mode of thinking and that the resurgence of religious and value-laden approaches threatens its integrity.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Science Fiction’s Depiction of Civilizational Cycles:</strong> Many science fiction writers have explored the rise and fall of civilizations, often attributing decline to the loss of scientific knowledge or the suppression of technology.
<ul>
<li>Examples: Wells’ “The Time Machine,” Campbell’s “Twilight,” Asimov’s “Foundation,” Piper’s “Tarot,” and Heinlein’s “Future History” series.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Heinlein’s “Crazy Years” and the Deterioration of Mores:</strong> Heinlein’s “Future History” chart predicted a period of technological advancement accompanied by a decline in morals and social institutions, culminating in mass psychosis.</li>
<li><strong>The Ubiquity of Perceived Moral Decline:</strong> The perception of moral decline is a recurring theme throughout history, as each generation tends to judge subsequent generations’ values against their own.</li>
<li><strong>Heinlein’s Prediction of a “New Crusade”:</strong> Heinlein also predicted a hiatus in space travel and the rise of a religious dictatorship that suppresses scientific research and technological progress.</li>
<li><strong>The Potential Accuracy of Heinlein’s Predictions:</strong> The author suggests that Heinlein’s predictions, particularly regarding the suppression of science and the rise of religious fervor, may be becoming increasingly accurate.</li>
<li><strong>Carl Sagan’s Warning about the Decline of Critical Thinking:</strong> Carl Sagan warned about the potential for a decline in critical thinking and a resurgence of superstition in a society dominated by technology controlled by a few.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The 1960s and 70s Cultural Shift:</strong> A significant cultural shift occurred in the 1960s and 70s, marked by a decline in trust, the rise of “culture wars,” and changes in fashion.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of the Shift:</strong> This shift contributed to the lack of technological progress, particularly in areas like flying cars, due to increased susceptibility to baseless fears and hostility towards technology, especially energy.</li>
<li><strong>Ergophobia:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Defined as the fear or hatred of work or energy.</li>
<li>Grew from a rare condition in the 1950s to a widespread phenomenon by the 1970s.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hypothetical Consequences:</strong>
<ul>
<li>If this cultural shift had occurred in a smaller, isolated community, it could have led to economic collapse, similar to historical examples like the Xhosa cattle-killing movement.</li>
<li>Even in a free market, areas with strong ergophobia might have failed, similar to many religiously-based utopian experiments.</li>

<li><strong>The Three Heads:</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Bureaucratic Structure of Science and Technology:</strong> Amplifies the Machiavelli Effect, where institutions prioritize self-preservation and power over their intended goals.</li>
<li><strong>Ergophobic Religion of the Eloi Agonists:</strong> The widespread fear and rejection of energy and technology, driven by those who benefit from fear-mongering and regulation.</li>
<li><strong>Strangling Red Tape of Regulation:</strong> Excessive government rules and regulations that hinder innovation and development.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Synergistic Effect:</strong> These three forces have increasingly reinforced each other, creating a powerful barrier to progress.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Impact of Regulation:</strong> Even in isolation, regulation was sufficient to hinder early attempts at developing flying cars.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Moulton Taylor’s Aero Car:</strong> A hypothetical scenario explores what might have happened if the Aero Car and similar designs had followed the same development path as the automobile.</li>
<li><strong>Assumptions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Starting point in 1950 with high pilot registration levels.</li>
<li>Initial ownership by wealthy enthusiasts and hobbyists, followed by broader adoption.</li>
<li>Technological improvements in areas like wing attachment, power, speed, reliability, and ease of use.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Potential Economic Impact:</strong>
<ul>
<li>By 1975, a significant new industry comparable to the automotive sector could have emerged, boosting GDP directly and indirectly.</li>
<li>Analogy to the Interstate Highway System: The Interstate system significantly impacted the U.S. economy, contributing to growth, lower prices, time savings, and reduced accidents.</li>
<li>Increased Property Values: Similar to the impact of new highways, flying cars could have increased property values and economic activity in previously isolated areas.</li>
<li>New Businesses and Increased Economic Radius: Flying cars could have spawned new industries (e.g., landing strips) and expanded the economic reach of households.</li>
<li>Addressing the Great Stagnation: Flying cars could have mitigated the Great Stagnation by increasing connectivity and reducing transportation costs to remote areas.</li>

<li><strong>Bureaucracy as a Perennial Problem:</strong> Throughout history, excessive bureaucracy and regulation have been identified as obstacles to progress, as noted by figures like Thomas Jefferson and Winston Churchill.</li>
<li><strong>The Wright Brothers and French Customs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In 1908, Wilbur Wright encountered damage to his airplane due to careless handling by French customs officials.</li>
<li>This incident highlights the potential for bureaucratic interference to hinder even groundbreaking innovations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bruce Halleck and the Rotaplane:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bruce Halleck, inventor of the Rotaplane flying car, faced legal trouble due to a misapplication of the Neutrality Act, illustrating how regulations can stifle inventors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Robert Edison Fulton Jr.&nbsp;and the Airphibian:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Airphibian, another promising flying car design, faced regulatory hurdles and ultimately failed to achieve production due to the high costs of meeting government standards.</li>

<li><strong>The Chevrolet Corvair:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The 1960 Chevrolet Corvair, with its rear-engine design, faced criticism despite its handling being comparable to or even superior to other cars of its time.</li>
<li>It became a target for <strong>Eloi Agonist</strong> fear-mongering, exemplified by Ralph Nader’s book “Unsafe at Any Speed.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Societal Shift and Susceptibility to Scare Stories:</strong>
<ul>
<li>By the 1960s, fewer people had direct experience with machinery, making them more vulnerable to scare stories about technology.</li>
<li>This increased susceptibility created an environment where fear-mongering by individuals like Nader and the perceived need for regulation could thrive.</li>

<section id="the-great-explosion" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-great-explosion">The Great Explosion</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Regulatory Explosion:</strong> The Great Stagnation coincided with a massive increase in federal regulation, particularly during the Nixon administration in the 1970s.</li>
<li><strong>Examples of New Regulations:</strong> This period saw the passage of major environmental and safety regulations like the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and the creation of agencies like OSHA and the EPA.</li>
<li><strong>Growth of the Federal Register:</strong> The Federal Register, which documents new regulations, grew dramatically under Nixon and continued to expand in subsequent decades.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity and Burden of Regulations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Modern regulations are often complex and difficult to understand, as illustrated by an example from the Federal Air Regulations.</li>
<li>The sheer volume and complexity of regulations create a significant burden for businesses and individuals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Economic Impact of Regulation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A study by Dawson and Seder found that excessive regulation has significantly reduced U.S. household income compared to a scenario with lower regulation.</li>
<li>They linked slower economic growth to heavier regulatory burdens.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Overestimation of Regulatory Benefits:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The actual benefits of regulation are often overstated, as demonstrated by an analysis of the 1962 drug laws, which slowed innovation without improving quality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact on Life Expectancy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Life expectancy gains in the U.S. were greater in the first half of the 20th century (pre-heavy regulation) than in the latter half, suggesting that regulation may not be the primary driver of safety improvements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Burden on Aviation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Regulation has significantly increased the cost of components for certified aircraft.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Airline Deregulation as a Counter-Example:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The deregulation of the airline industry in 1978 led to lower fares, increased safety, and overall benefits for consumers.</li>
<li>This example demonstrates that deregulation can lead to positive outcomes, challenging the assumption that heavy regulation is always necessary.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rise of Product Liability:</strong> The 1970s saw a surge in product liability lawsuits, often driven by scare stories and large jury awards.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on the General Aviation Industry:</strong>
<ul>
<li>This increase in lawsuits devastated the general aviation industry, leading to the cessation of production by major manufacturers like Cessna and Piper.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Explanation of the Collapse:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics attributes the collapse to the dramatic increase in liability costs, which made it unsustainable for aircraft manufacturers to operate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Role of Regulation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>While the energy crisis initially impacted sales, the subsequent collapse of the industry was primarily driven by the product liability environment, not cyclical factors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>General Aviation Revitalization Act:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Congress passed the General Aviation Revitalization Act in 1994 to limit liability for older aircraft, but the industry never fully recovered.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Consequences:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The cost of private airplanes has skyrocketed, and the number of new aircraft produced annually is a fraction of what it once was.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Broader Impact of Liability Costs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The general aviation industry’s experience is just one example of how product liability costs have negatively impacted various industries and the economy as a whole.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Economic Costs of the Tort System:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. tort system, including product liability, consumes a significant portion of GDP, potentially slowing overall economic growth.</li>
<li>This cost also includes the loss of talented individuals who are drawn into legal professions instead of contributing to innovation and production.</li>

<ul>
<li>Airplanes are mechanically simpler than cars, with basic models requiring only a glider-like structure, a motor, and a propeller.</li>
<li>However, flying is more challenging than driving due to the three-dimensional nature of flight, requiring adjustments to human instincts.</li>
<li>The Wright brothers’ significant contribution was solving the problem of control, altitude, and steering in flight.</li>
<li>Learning to fly involves mastering four key tasks:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Aviate:</strong> Maintaining control of the aircraft.</li>
<li><strong>Navigate:</strong> Ensuring the plane is on the correct course.</li>
<li><strong>Communicate:</strong> Interacting with air traffic control and other pilots.</li>
<li><strong>Engineer:</strong> Monitoring and managing the engine and other mechanical systems.</li>

<li>Unlike cars, airplanes are most vulnerable at low speeds, especially during landing.</li>
<li>Maintaining a minimum speed is crucial to prevent stalling, which is the loss of lift due to a disrupted airflow over the wings.</li>
<li><strong>Stall speed</strong> is the speed at which the stall angle of attack generates lift equal to the airplane’s weight. Going below this speed can result in a loss of altitude.</li>

<section id="windy" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="windy">Windy</h4>
<ul>
<li>The force exerted by wind increases with the square of its speed, making high-speed flight a significant challenge.</li>
<li>Airplanes utilize aerodynamic principles to generate lift and overcome drag, allowing them to stay aloft.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="how-it-flies" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-it-flies">How It Flies</h4>
<ul>
<li>Airplane wings generate lift by creating a pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces.
<ul>
<li>The curved upper surface forces the air to travel a longer distance, creating a lower pressure area.</li>
<li>The higher pressure underneath the wing pushes the wing upward, generating lift.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lift</strong> is proportional to the square of the speed and the <strong>angle of attack</strong> (the angle between the wing and the oncoming airflow).</li>
<li><strong>Stall</strong> occurs when the angle of attack exceeds a critical point, causing the airflow to separate from the wing and resulting in a loss of lift.</li>
<li>The Wright brothers initially modeled wings on bird wings but later adopted more rounded and flatter designs for easier handling.</li>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>power curve</strong> illustrates the relationship between airspeed and vertical speed (rate of climb or descent) for an airplane.</li>
<li>The curve shifts up or down depending on engine power (throttle setting).</li>
<li>At the front end of the curve, pushing the nose down increases speed, both forward and downward.</li>
<li>At the back end of the curve (slower speeds), pulling the nose up can actually cause the plane to slow down further and descend, increasing the risk of a stall.</li>

<li>Airplanes are balanced on their wings, and the <strong>elevator</strong> (a control surface on the tail) provides pitch control.</li>
<li>Proper weight distribution and balance are crucial for safe flight, similar to loading a rowboat.</li>
<li>Aerodynamic forces increase with the square of the speed, allowing heavier planes to maintain lift by flying faster.</li>
<li>However, increased weight also requires higher landing speeds, potentially making runways seem shorter during landing.</li>

<li>Pilots who are <strong>instrument-rated</strong> and fly aircraft equipped for icing conditions have more flexibility but still face limitations.</li>
<li><strong>Wind shear</strong>, a sudden change in wind speed or direction, can be particularly dangerous, especially during landing.</li>
<li>Clouds, haze, and fog can reduce visibility, posing a risk of collision with terrain or other aircraft.</li>
<li>Flying in clouds or over featureless terrain can lead to <strong>spatial disorientation</strong>, where pilots lose their sense of direction and may inadvertently enter a dangerous flight attitude.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Helicopters</strong> offer a significant advantage in certain terrains and situations.
<ul>
<li>New Zealand, with its rugged terrain and sparse roads, has a high rate of helicopter ownership (1 per 6,000 people).</li>
<li>The US has a much lower rate (1 per 35,000 people).</li>

<li>Cruise speed</li>
<li>Operational ceiling</li>
<li>Engine type (Lycoming air-cooled horizontally opposed aero engine)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Differences:
<ul>
<li>Airplane has twice the range.</li>
<li>Helicopter requires a much smaller landing area (10 ft x 10 ft pad vs.&nbsp;thousands of feet of runway).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Advantages of Helicopters:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smaller landing area:</strong> This allows for helipads in places like hospitals, resorts, and corporate headquarters.</li>
<li><strong>More civilized takeoff:</strong> No taxiing or runway required, simply a smooth vertical ascent.</li>
<li><strong>Less susceptible to wind gusts:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The fast-moving rotor (at airliner speeds) is less affected by wind speed variations.</li>
<li>The smaller rotor area reduces the impact of gusts.</li>

<li><strong>Disadvantages of Helicopters:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>More complex piloting:</strong>
<ul>
<li>More links in the energy chain (engine speed, altitude, rotor speed).</li>
<li>More demanding control due to instability and non-intuitive rotor dynamics.</li>
<li>Lag between control input and response (unlike airplanes that can be briefly left uncontrolled).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pilot seat placement:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Helicopter pilot seats are typically on the right, a tradition stemming from the Sikorsky R-4’s demanding controls which favored right-handed stick operation and left-handed collective control and radio operation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mechanical complexity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Individually hinged, flapped, and tilted rotor blades.</li>
<li>Collective and cyclic controls for adjusting blade angle of attack.</li>

<li>Increased efficiency leads to greater overall value.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Travel Theory:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Studies how much people travel in different environments and modes.</li>

<li><strong>Trip Values Graph:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shows the value of destinations at various distances based on people’s willingness to travel.</li>
<li>Peak for trips under 10 miles due to low time cost and shadowing effect (nearby destinations are preferred).</li>

<li><strong>Helicopter-like VTOL (100 knots):</strong> Dominates for short distances.</li>
<li><strong>Convertible Airplane (200 knots):</strong> Better for longer distances.</li>
<li><strong>Jet Car (400 mph, requires airport):</strong> Dominates for very long distances, but not used for short trips.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Value Calculation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A jet car VTOL (400 mph, no latency) would be worth 7 times the value of a regular car.</li>

<li>With mass production and deregulation, autogyros could have become affordable by now.</li>
<li>Pitcairn PCA2: $15,000 in 1931, under $5,000 by the late 1930s.</li>
<li>Autogyros could have enabled widespread private landing strips and facilitated helicopter development.</li>
<li>Eastern Airlines used mail-carrying autogyros from the Philadelphia Post Office rooftop in the 1930s.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ideal Flying Car Specs (Travel Theory):</strong> 5 minutes overhead, 250 knots speed (worth 5 times a car).</li>
<li><strong>Power Requirements for 250 Knots:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Need horsepower between 0.15 and 0.25 times the aircraft weight in pounds.</li>
<li>Estimated 600 horsepower needed for a 3,000-pound vehicle (2,000-pound empty weight, 1,000-pound payload).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Piston Engines vs.&nbsp;Turbines:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Piston engines are too heavy for this application (a 600 hp engine weighs around 900 pounds).</li>
<li>Turbines offer a much higher power-to-weight ratio (e.g., Lycoming Honeywell LTS 101-650C: 675 hp, 241 pounds).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Turbine Advantage:</strong>
<ul>
<li>High power-to-weight ratio.</li>
<li>Higher reliability (10,000-hour overhaul interval vs.&nbsp;2,000 for piston engines).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Turbine Cost:</strong> Expensive, but potentially within reach if mass production and innovation had continued.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for Turbine-Powered Flying Cars:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Could have achieved car-like adoption levels in a non-stagnated present with higher incomes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Futurist Predictions:</strong> Flying cars of the future were envisioned with turbines, enabling both VTOL and high speeds.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Public Awareness vs.&nbsp;Scientific Understanding:</strong> Despite the political prominence of nuclear issues, there is a lack of public understanding of nuclear physics.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Availability of Current Literature:</strong> Bookstores have a scarcity of recent texts on nuclear physics, with many older books being reprinted without updates.</li>
<li><strong>Norman Cook’s Observation:</strong> Nuclear physics lacks a unified theoretical framework comparable to quantum electrodynamics in atomic physics. This necessitates a phenomenological approach with separate formulations for different nuclear phenomena.</li>
<li><strong>Used Bookstore Experience:</strong> A search in a well-stocked used bookstore revealed only three books on nuclear physics, the most recent being from 1991. This indicates a decline in interest and demand for the subject.</li>
<li><strong>Declining PhDs in Nuclear Physics:</strong> The number of PhDs awarded in nuclear physics has decreased significantly since the 1970s, reflecting limited career prospects.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences of Stagnation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Most operating reactors are still based on 1960s Generation 2 pressurized water designs.</li>

<li>The 1950s and the space race instilled a sense of urgency in technological development, exemplified by projects like the Manhattan Project and the Apollo program.</li>
<li>This urgency has since diminished, leading to stagnation in fields like nanotechnology.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Foresight Institute’s Battelle Roadmap to Productive Nanosystems:</strong>
<ul>
<li>An attempt to guide nanotechnology research towards Feynman’s and Drexler’s original vision of atomically precise manufacturing.</li>
<li>Focused on techniques producing atomically precise products, excluding broader approaches like the Feynman path.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Feynman’s Vision:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Build an automated machine shop, operable by remote control.</li>
<li>Capable of building a complete working copy of itself at its own scale and a smaller scale.</li>
<li>The challenge lies in fabricating parts with better tolerances than the machine itself.</li>
<li>The ultimate goal is to reach molecular manipulation capabilities through iterative miniaturization.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="obstacles-and-misconceptions">Obstacles and Misconceptions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Giggle Factor:</strong> A common reaction of skepticism and dismissal towards the idea of macro-scale self-replicating machines (<strong>SRMs</strong>).
<ul>
<li>This stems from the intuition that factories are inherently larger and more complex than their products (e.g., a car factory vs.&nbsp;a car).</li>
<li>The Feynman path challenges this intuition by proposing machines that can build copies of themselves.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Skepticism about Self-Replication:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>George Friedman</strong>, engineering professor at USC, highlighted the lack of self-replicating machines despite the perceived simplicity of biological self-replication.</li>
<li><strong>Mark Reed</strong>, Yale nanotech researcher, expressed skepticism about the self-replication capabilities of machines built with atomically-sized parts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenges in SRM Design:</strong>
<ul>
<li>SRMs defy standard top-down design methodologies, as the product (the machine itself) is unknown until the design is complete.</li>
<li>Many SRM designs either:
<ul>
<li>Oversimplify construction capabilities by relying on pre-made complex subsystems.</li>
<li>Become overly complex by incorporating capabilities like mining and refining raw materials (e.g., the 1980 NASA moon base study).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Misconception of MEMS as a Failed Feynman Path:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems):</strong> A technology for creating micromachines using photolithography (similar to integrated circuit manufacturing).</li>
<li>While MEMS allows for the creation of incredibly small machines, their <strong>relative tolerances</strong> (accuracy of fabrication relative to size) are significantly lower than those achieved in traditional machining.
<ul>
<li>Standard machining: Relative tolerances of one in a million.</li>
<li>MEMS: Relative tolerances of one in one hundred.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This leads to issues like <strong>stiction</strong> (super-friction), hindering the creation of complex mechanisms like bearings, gears, and screws.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Feynman’s Emphasis on Precision:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Feynman recognized the need for improving precision at each stage of miniaturization.</li>
<li>He proposed techniques like lapping and polishing to achieve higher tolerances at smaller scales.</li>
<li>This iterative improvement of precision is crucial for achieving the Feynman path’s goals.</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-potential-of-the-feynman-path">The Potential of the Feynman Path</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits of a MEMS-scale Machine Shop:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Even a millimeter-sized system with 10-micron parts, built using the Feynman path, would have immense value, particularly in medical applications.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for high-throughput microfluidic devices (like <strong>ILINPs</strong>) for vaccine manufacturing. A Feynman path approach could have significantly accelerated their production.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Synergy with Bottom-Up Approaches:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Feynman path and bottom-up approaches (e.g., chemistry, molecular biology, DNA origami) are not mutually exclusive.</li>
<li>They can complement each other, with bottom-up methods producing atomically precise parts and top-down methods assembling them.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Nanoscientists creating atomically precise nanogears could be utilized directly by Feynman-Path machines.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Accelerated Timeline for Nanotech:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Pursuing the Feynman path alongside bottom-up approaches could potentially cut the development time for “real nanotech” from 20 years to 10 years.</li>

<ul>
<li>Flying cars, a frequent topic in discussions about the future, are <strong>technologically feasible</strong>.</li>
<li>They have been built and flown since the 1930s.
<ul>
<li>Example: The <strong>auto gyro</strong> had innovative design and funding but faced challenges during the Great Depression.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Obstacles to development:</strong>
<ul>
<li>1930s: Great Depression hampered marketing.</li>
<li>1940s: World War II diverted engineering talent and resources to war production.</li>
<li>1950s:
<ul>
<li><strong>Aircraft regulations caused delays in supply.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Investment in highways and infrastructure reduced demand.</strong></li>
<li>The government hindered Pickhairn’s efforts to develop flying cars.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>1960s:
<ul>
<li>Passenger jet travel and private aviation boomed.</li>
<li>Military developed <strong>VTOLs (Vertical Take-Off and Landing aircraft)</strong>, like air jeeps.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>1970s:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Henry Adams Curve</strong>, representing long-term energy growth, <strong>flatlined</strong>, impacting technology dependent on energy.</li>
<li>Academia shifted towards virtue-signaling and self-deception, hindering technological advancement.</li>
<li>A “Baptists and bootleggers” alliance formed between those who believed in progressive policies and those who benefited from the associated funding and influence.</li>
<li>Public spending and PhDs tripled between 1960 and 1980.</li>
<li>The <strong>“war on cars”</strong> gained traction, leading to policies that discouraged car use.</li>
<li>Supersonic flight was banned.</li>
<li>Bridge building, which peaked in the 1960s, declined, leading to increased traffic congestion (five times worse than in the 1960s).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Around 1980:
<ul>
<li><strong>Liability law developments crippled the private aviation industry.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Regulation increased significantly.</strong></li>
<li>Bureaucrats, unconcerned with costs, replaced those who balanced costs and benefits in decision-making.</li>
<li>The <strong>cost disease</strong> replaced the <strong>learning curve</strong> in the economy.</li>
<li>The nuclear industry faced escalating costs and stagnated.</li>
<li>Interest and research in nuclear physics declined.</li>

<ul>
<li>Science fiction writers accurately predicted the technology for flying cars and nuclear power.</li>
<li>Their overestimation of <strong>fusion power</strong> was based on the opinions of experts at the time (estimated to be 50 years optimistic).</li>
<li><strong>Flying cars:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Development hindered by historical events, government actions, regulations, and liability concerns.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Space travel:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Received substantial government funding for military and prestige reasons.</li>
<li>Writers like <strong>Clark</strong> were overly optimistic about colonization, while <strong>Heinlein</strong> predicted a government takeover hostile to technology and a pause in space travel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Nuclear power:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Manhattan Project, while costly, did not yield economically beneficial technology like the B-29 project.</li>
<li>Military restrictions hindered private development of nuclear power.</li>
<li>It took decades for nuclear power to become economically viable, and then it was stifled by regulation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Computing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Experienced a <strong>phase change</strong> from centralized computing centers to decentralized personal computers.</li>
<li>Combined with the internet, it progressed as predicted by technological optimists.</li>
<li><strong>Asimov</strong> and <strong>Clark’s</strong> predictions about applications like robots and information access were largely accurate.</li>
<li>Ordering online and receiving quick delivery is similar to predictions by <strong>Nolan (1927)</strong> and <strong>Heinlein (1938).</strong></li>

<li><strong>The author previously argued against a sudden AI takeoff driven by self-improving super AI.</strong></li>
<li>Instead, he predicted a more gradual but effective progress:
<ul>
<li><strong>AI would start to work, attract investment, and experience rapid development.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>AlphaGo</strong> was the first program to play Go at a professional level.</li>
<li><strong>Go</strong> was previously considered a significant AI challenge:
<ul>
<li><strong>Quote (from Beyond AI):</strong> “By contrast to chess, programs playing Go have yet to challenge even serious amateurs, much less the top professionals.”</li>
<li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Go requires concept formation and dynamic assessment of game pieces (clusters).</li>
<li><strong>Quote (from Beyond AI):</strong> “playing go well requires solving the real AI problem, that of creating useful concepts from experience.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>AlphaGo’s success:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Utilizes two deep neural nets integrated with a traditional game-playing program.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid improvement:</strong> Beat top-ranked player Lee Sedol in 2016.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Criticisms and Rebuttals:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some dismissed AlphaGo’s achievement as “brute force” due to its reliance on substantial computing power (1,920 CPUs and 280 GPUs).</li>
<li><strong>Counterargument:</strong> Access to and effective deployment of computing power is a significant real-world advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Google developed custom chips to accelerate deep learning algorithms.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shift from Academia to Industry:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>DeepMind’s AlphaGo paper had 20 authors.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Machine learning engineer is the fastest-growing job (LinkedIn 2017).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Numerous AI/machine learning conferences held annually (e.g., 225 in 2018).</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Quote (Philip Francis Nolan, Armageddon, 2419 A.D.):</strong> Depicts a future where machines replace human labor.</li>
<li><strong>The Jetsons oversimplified the implications of automation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Real-world trend:</strong> Technology has consistently increased productivity, requiring fewer people to produce more goods.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Farmers in 1790 fed 1.1 people each; now they feed 40.</li>
<li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> US manufacturing jobs declined from over 33% in the 1940s to under 9% now, while output tripled.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Manufacturing productivity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Output per worker increased from $25,000 in 1962 to $160,000 in 2012 (constant 2010 dollars).</li>
<li><strong>Hyper-exponential growth:</strong> Productivity increases are accelerating.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Projected manufacturing worker productivity in 2062:</strong> $661,000 (constant 2010 dollars) or $1,854,392 (with 3% inflation).</li>
<li><strong>The question of work in a highly automated future:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thought experiment:</strong> Lining up the US population along I-80 in order of productivity.</li>
<li><strong>Finding the cutoff point:</strong> Where the fewest people can maintain a desired level of consumption.</li>
<li><strong>With 1790’s consumption levels and 2020’s technology, only a small fraction of the population would need to work.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Unemployment is not at 98% because we desire a higher level of consumption than our ancestors.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Keynes’ observation (1933):</strong> Technological advancements in economizing labor need to be matched by finding new uses for labor.</li>
<li><strong>Labor force participation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Historically around 90% until the mid-20th century.</li>
<li>Declined to around 70% for men and 50% overall by 2020.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Truck driver example:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Self-driving trucks are a potential source of job displacement.</li>
<li><strong>However, automation often leads to increased efficiency within an industry rather than complete job elimination.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Trucking will likely follow the pattern of manufacturing, with fewer workers handling more freight.</strong></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-cleaner-better-breed-machine-ethics">A Cleaner, Better Breed: Machine Ethics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early AI ethics concerns:</strong> Focused on the potential threat of superintelligent AI (e.g., turning us all into paperclips).</li>
<li><strong>Critique of early AI:</strong> Little attention was given to imbuing AI with a sense of morality.</li>
<li><strong>Analogy to natural language processing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>AI struggled for decades to achieve competent language understanding and generation.</li>
<li><strong>Moral reasoning might be similarly complex.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lack of research in computational ethics:</strong> No significant work compared to computational linguistics.</li>
<li><strong>Beyond AI (2007):</strong> One of the first books dedicated to machine ethics.</li>
<li><strong>GPT-3 and the illusion of understanding:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>GPT-3</strong> is a powerful language model that can generate impressive text.</li>
<li><strong>However, it lacks true understanding; it primarily relies on statistical patterns in its training data.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Understanding requires mental models that enable recognition, imitation, prediction, and manipulation of concepts.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The challenge of building a corpus of moral judgments:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unlike language data, there’s no readily available massive dataset for training ethical AI.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Short-term solution: Asimov’s robots - “Do what the humans tell you to do.”</strong></li>
<li><strong>Humans can train robots through feedback and reinforcement.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Building a corpus of practical and moral judgments:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Robots can learn from human instructions and examples.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing learned judgments can create a collective knowledge base for ethical decision-making.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The potential for morally superior robots:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quote (Asimov):</strong> “They’re a cleaner, better breed than we are.”</li>
<li><strong>Focusing on the positive aspects of human behavior can lead to robots with enhanced ethical capabilities.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example: Ethical retail clerk robot:</strong> No extra effort needed to prevent it from stealing, highlighting the inherent reliability of robots.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits of robots in positions of trust:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reliability, 24/7 availability, no human biases or misconduct.</li>
<li>Reduced financial losses due to employee theft.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Sorcerer’s Apprentice problem:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The hypothetical scenario of a robot tasked with maximizing paperclip production leading to disastrous consequences.</li>
<li><strong>This scenario is considered unrealistic:</strong> It assumes a combination of superhuman intelligence and a lack of common sense.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Robots will be developed incrementally, with continuous improvements addressing potential flaws.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Example: Robot doctors:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Future robots could combine the knowledge of general practitioners and specialists, potentially exceeding human capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Encyclopedic expertise, instant access to research, high IQ, no fatigue or errors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Programming robots through natural language:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Advanced AI will understand human instructions, leading to easier and more intuitive programming.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Robots’ impact on quality of life:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased competence in professional services.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Affordable domestic help (like Rosie the Robot).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-driving cars (like personal chauffeurs).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Combined with nanotechnology, robots can significantly enhance living standards.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> While challenges remain, the dawn of robots promises significant advancements and improvements to our lives. We can see enough of the future to be optimistic about the potential benefits of this technology.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-three-miracles-of-cold-fusion">The Three Miracles of Cold Fusion</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>John Huizenga’s Critique:</strong> Identified three key challenges that a theory of cold fusion must address:
<ul>
<li><strong>1. The Coulomb Barrier:</strong> The energy required for nuclear fusion is much higher than what electrochemical processes can provide.</li>
<li><strong>2. Reaction Pathways:</strong> Deuterium fusion typically produces tritium and a proton or helium-3 and a neutron, which are not detected in expected quantities.</li>
<li><strong>3. Energy Output:</strong> Even if fusion occurs, the expected high-energy gamma rays are not detected. Instead, heat is observed.</li>

<li><strong>Communication Gap:</strong> Feynman threatened to resign from the commission unless it addressed the communication gap between NASA engineers and management.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dilbertization of NASA:</strong> NASA’s bureaucratic issues worsened over time, though the agency represented a best-case scenario in the 1960s due to its talented personnel, common goals, and well-defined tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Shuttle Program Failure:</strong> The Space Shuttle program, aimed at reducing the cost to orbit, ultimately failed to meet its goals.
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost Goal vs.&nbsp;Reality:</strong> The goal was $100 per pound; the lowest achieved was $10,000 per pound.</li>
<li><strong>Launch Frequency Goal vs.&nbsp;Reality:</strong> The goal was once a week; the average was once in 11 weeks.</li>
<li><strong>Shuttle Reliability:</strong> The shuttle had a 1.5% failure rate, resulting in the death of everyone on board during failures.</li>

<p>“A ship with a million-ton payload could escape from the Earth with the expenditure of about 1,000 H-bombs with yields of a few megatons. The fuel cost of such a mission would be about five cents per pound of payload, at present prices. Each bomb would be surrounded by a thousand tons of inert propellant material, and it would be easy to load this material with boron to such an extent that practically no neutrons escape to the atmosphere. The atmospheric contamination would only arise from tritium and from fission products. Preliminary studies indicate that the tritium contamination from such a series of high-yield explosions would not approach biologically significant levels.”</p>

<ul>
<li>Wind load increases with building height.</li>
<li>The Eiffel Tower’s structural members experience tension, not compression, on the windward side at the second platform level.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Modern skyscrapers utilize interesting shapes (twists, holes) to mitigate wind load.
<ul>
<li>These shapes break up wind vortex streets generated by simple, regular shapes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Wind loading</strong> increases significantly up to 20,000 feet (4 miles), plateaus until 40,000 feet, and then decreases due to lower air density.</li>
<li><strong>Pressurization</strong> becomes necessary for buildings between 5,000 and 10,000 feet to accommodate human habitation.
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, increasing the oxygen fraction of interior air could maintain sea level partial pressure up to about 35,000 feet (7 miles).</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="densification-vs.-quality-of-life">Densification vs.&nbsp;Quality of Life</h3>
<ul>
<li>The tension between <strong>densification</strong> and quality of life arises from the incentives of bureaucrats and politicians.
<ul>
<li>They often benefit from increased interaction and contention among citizens, which creates opportunities for control and favors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This incentive contributes to the prevalence of flat, one-level cities where various modes of transportation and pedestrians compete for space.</li>
<li><strong>Jane Jacobs</strong> recognized the importance of community interaction in neighborhoods, but this concept is more applicable to smaller communities than large metropolises.</li>
<li>Apartment buildings can foster a sense of community if designed and managed properly.</li>
<li><strong>Densification proponents</strong> often cite the paradox of road closures not always leading to increased traffic on remaining streets.
<ul>
<li>This phenomenon can be explained by <strong>travel theory</strong>: when something becomes more expensive (in time or effort), people demand less of it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Building more roads can lead to more traffic, but this new traffic represents increased access to desired activities.</li>
<li>An optimal city design would incorporate multiple levels of traffic interconnect, pedestrian walkways, and potentially towering structures.</li>

<li><strong>Mead’s Critique of 20th Century Physics:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quote:</strong> “It is my firm belief that the last seven decades of the 20th century will be characterized in history as the dark ages of theoretical physics.” - Carver Mead (Source: Mead)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Einstein vs.&nbsp;Bohr:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Niels Bohr:</strong> The dominant figure in quantum mechanics during the early to mid-20th century, particularly known for the <strong>Copenhagen Interpretation</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Albert Einstein:</strong> Opposed the Copenhagen Interpretation, arguing against the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. (“God doesn’t play dice with the universe.”)</li>
<li>Bohr was generally considered to have “won” the debates within the physics community.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Success and Challenges of Quantum Mechanics:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The mathematics of quantum mechanics has been highly successful in predicting experimental outcomes statistically.</li>
<li>However, the <strong>interpretation</strong> of quantum mechanics remains a source of contention and seemingly incoherent explanations.
<ul>
<li><strong>Schrödinger’s cat:</strong> A thought experiment highlighting the absurdity of certain interpretations.</li>
<li><strong>Copenhagen Interpretation:</strong> The cat is neither alive nor dead until observed.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-central-mystery-and-alternative-interpretations">The Central Mystery and Alternative Interpretations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Wave-Particle Duality:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Energy, such as a photon of light, behaves like a wave when traveling but interacts like a particle upon detection.</li>
<li><strong>Analogy:</strong> A rubber ducky thrown into water creates a wave that spreads out. The ducky disappears, and then reappears somewhere else with a probability related to the wave’s amplitude at that location. The wave then instantly vanishes everywhere else.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Copenhagen Interpretation’s Limitations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>It claims that the ducky’s path between sightings is unknowable and that the wave is a mental construct.</li>
<li>This is seen as a denial of deeper knowledge, similar to behaviorism’s focus on stimulus and response.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Problems with the Copenhagen Interpretation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The insistence on the electron being both a wave and a point particle leads to issues like:
<ul>
<li><strong>Renormalization:</strong> Mathematical adjustments that Einstein and Schrödinger criticized as being akin to Ptolemaic epicycles.</li>
<li><strong>Vacuum energy discrepancy:</strong> The vast difference between theoretical and observed vacuum energy density.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Alternative Perspectives:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Carver Mead, along with Einstein, Schrödinger, Fred Hoyle, Jayant Narlikar, Paul Davies, and John Cramer (with contributions from Wheeler and Feynman), advocate for alternative interpretations.</li>
<li>They believe that a deeper reality exists and that Schrödinger’s equation, when properly interpreted, can explain quantum phenomena without resorting to “magic.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Electron as a Wave:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The electron is seen as the wave itself, not a point particle guided by a non-physical wave.</li>
<li>Particle-like behavior arises from the mathematics of wave mechanics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Advanced Wave Solution:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Standard practice often discards the <strong>advanced wave</strong> solution of the wave equation.</li>
<li>Keeping and utilizing the advanced wave leads to a better understanding of coherent quantum phenomena (e.g., lasers, superconductors, resonant tunneling, Bose-Einstein condensates).</li>

<p>“The rapid progress true science now makes occasions my regretting sometimes that I was born so soon. It is impossible to imagine the height to which may be carried in a one thousand years the power of man over matter. We may perhaps learn to deprive large masses of their gravity and give them absolute levity for the sake of easy transport. Agriculture may diminish its labor and double its produce. All diseases may by sure means be prevented or cured, not accepting even that of old age, and our lives lengthened at pleasure even beyond the antediluvian standard. Oh, that moral science were in as fair a way of improvement, that men would cease to be wolves to one another, and the human beings would at length learn what they now improperly call humanity.” - Benjamin Franklin</p>

<p>“Dystopia used to be a fiction of resistance. It’s become a fiction of submission. The fiction of an untrusting, lonely, and sullen 21st century. The fiction of fake news and info wars. The fiction of helplessness and hopelessness. It cannot imagine a better future, and it doesn’t ask anyone to bother to make one. It nurses grievances and indulges resentments. It doesn’t call for courage. It finds that cowardice suffices. Its only admonition is, despair more.” - Jill Lepore, Harvard historian</p>

<li><strong>1907 (Optimistic):</strong>
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“He could see that the new American, the child of incalculable coal power, chemical power, electric power, and radiating energy, as well as of new forces yet undetermined, must be a sort of God compared with any former creation of nature. At the rate of progress since 1800, every American who lived into the year 2000 would know how to control unlimited power. He would think in complexities unimaginable to an earlier mind.
