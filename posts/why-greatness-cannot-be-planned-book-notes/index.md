## Preface

### The Origin of the Book

- This book originated from a radical idea in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** about algorithms achieving amazing things without explicit objectives.

- Initial experiments yielded surprising results, prompting further exploration beyond AI.

- The idea expanded to encompass broader implications for life, culture, society, innovation, achievement, biology, and more.

- > **"If you don’t understand why I say that’s unusual, just consider how rare or bizarre it is for a computer algorithm to change how you think about life."**


### Public Reaction and Book's Purpose

- Stanley, a professor, began incorporating the idea into public talks, observing its impact on audiences.

- The book aims to communicate this novel insight and its broad implications to a wider audience.

- > **"There is a story here—a story about an idea in AI and how it grew into something bigger—but there’s also a journey through a dizzying set of surprisingly broad implications for everything from personal dating, to the march of science, to the evolution of the human brain."**





## Chapter 1: Questioning Objectives

### Introduction: A World Driven by Objectives

*   **Objectives** are deeply ingrained in our culture, influencing everything from education and careers to personal goals and societal aspirations.
*   We rarely question the value of framing our pursuits with objectives.
*   Examples of objective-driven pursuits:
    *   Education: Mastering subjects, achieving high test scores.
    *   Careers: Job promotions, financial success.
    *   Personal life: Finding a partner, improving physical appearance.
    *   Societal goals: Low crime rates, economic growth, environmental sustainability.
*   The assumption is that any worthy accomplishment is best achieved by setting it as an objective and pursuing it with conviction. 

### The Prevalence of Objectives in Various Fields

*   **Engineering:** Objectives are set through rigorous specifications, and progress is measured against these specifications.
*   **Science:** Objectives are essential for securing funding and judging project success.
*   **Investing:** Objectives focus on earnings and profits.
*   **Art and Design:** Objectives involve conceiving a design and pursuing its realization.
*   **Evolutionary Biology:** Objectives are framed in terms of survival and reproduction.
*   **Artificial Intelligence:** Algorithms are designed to work towards specific objectives.

### The Appeal and Comfort of Objectives

*   Objectives offer a sense of order and predictability in an unpredictable world.
*   The belief that setting an objective creates possibility and that hard work leads to success provides a sense of optimism.

### The Downside of Objectives: Limitations and Costs

*   **Limitations:** 
    *   Objectives can limit freedom and exploration.
    *   They can stifle playful discovery and creativity.
*   **Costs:**
    *   Objectives can lead to an overwhelming focus on measurements, assessments, and metrics.
    *   They can become straitjackets, hindering our ability to explore new possibilities.

### The Paradox of Ambitious Objectives

*   **Ambitious objectives**, those whose achievement is uncertain, often become obstacles to their own fulfillment.
*   The stepping stones to achieving ambitious objectives are often unpredictable and counterintuitive.
*   Focusing solely on the objective can blind us to the necessary stepping stones.

### Achievement as a Process of Discovery

*   **Achievement** can be viewed as a process of **discovery** within a vast **search space** of possibilities.
*   **Search space:** The set of all possible things relevant to a particular domain (e.g., all possible images, inventions, musical genres).
*   **Stepping stones:** Discoveries or innovations that pave the way for further progress within the search space.
*   Exploration of the search space and the discovery of stepping stones are crucial for reaching ambitious objectives.

### The Unpredictability of Stepping Stones

*   **Stepping stones** often bear little resemblance to the final objective.
*   Examples of unpredictable stepping stones:
    *   Vacuum tubes (originally for electricity and radio) became crucial for early computers.
    *   Engines (not initially intended for flight) were essential for airplanes.
    *   Microwave technology (developed for radar) led to microwave ovens.
*   The structure of the search space is often **unpredictable** and **deceptive**. 
*   Focusing solely on the objective can distract us from the unexpected stepping stones that are necessary for its achievement.

### The Power of No Objective: Serendipity and Discovery

*   **Great ideas** often emerge without being explicitly pursued as objectives.
*   Examples of serendipitous discoveries:
    *   Rock and roll music emerged from the fusion of various musical genres without a conscious objective to create it.
    *   Elvis Presley's unique sound was a result of unplanned experimentation rather than a deliberate objective.
*   **Serendipity** can play a significant role in achieving greatness.

### Exploring the Search Space Without Objectives

*   It's possible to explore a search space intelligently and creatively without a specific objective.
*   Abandoning objectives doesn't necessitate aimless wandering; we can align ourselves towards discovery and exploration.
*   **The Paradox:** Sometimes the best way to achieve greatness is to stop trying to achieve a specific great thing.

### Implications and Benefits of Questioning Objectives

*   **Personal Liberation:** Freedom from the pressure of objectives and metrics, allowing for greater creativity and exploration.
*   **Scientific Advancements:**  Potentially fostering breakthroughs by encouraging open-ended exploration and serendipitous discoveries.
*   **Engineering and Design:** Promoting innovative solutions that might not be conceived under strict objective-driven approaches.
*   **Understanding Evolution:** Recognizing the role of serendipity and unexpected adaptations in the development of life.
*   **Algorithm Development:** Exploring new approaches to AI that move beyond objective-driven algorithms.

### Conclusion: Breaking Free from the Myth of the Objective

*   The objective-driven culture can be limiting and stifling.
*   We can achieve greatness by embracing exploration, serendipity, and the freedom to deviate from predetermined objectives.
*   By questioning the myth of the objective, we can unlock our potential for creativity, innovation, and true fulfillment.







## Chapter 2: Victory for the Aimless

### Introduction

*   **Paradox of ambitious objectives:** The most significant successes often arise unexpectedly, deviating from initial plans and objectives. 
*   **Serendipity:**  Embracing unexpected opportunities and being open to changing direction can lead to greater achievements than rigidly adhering to a predetermined path.
*   **Stepping stones:**  Unforeseen events or choices can act as stepping stones towards unanticipated, fulfilling outcomes.

### The Deception of Career Planning

*   **Abundance of Career Guidance:** Numerous resources, tests, and experts aim to help individuals identify and pursue their ideal careers.
    *   Examples: *What Color Is Your Parachute?* by Richard Bolles, Career Key test, Campbell Interest and Skill Survey, Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, Keirsey Temperament Sorter.
*   **Success Stories that Defy Planning:** Many highly successful individuals achieved their accomplishments through unplanned detours and unexpected opportunities.
    *   **Key Idea:**  Anticipating the most fulfilling path is challenging in open-ended problems like career choice, making openness and flexibility crucial. 
*   **The Value of Openness (Wiseman's Experiment):** 
    *   Subjects tasked with counting photographs in a newspaper.
    *   Those less focused on the objective noticed a message revealing the answer earlier, demonstrating that excessive focus on a goal can hinder discoveries.
    *   **Key Idea:**  Openness to unexpected information or opportunities can lead to faster and more efficient solutions.

### Serendipity in Action: Examples of Unplanned Success

*   **Johnny Depp:**
    *   Joined a band, leading to marriage and introduction to acting through his wife (a makeup artist).
    *   **Key Idea:**  A passion for music (not acting) became an unexpected stepping stone to a successful acting career.
*   **John Grisham:**
    *   Practiced law for 10 years before a courtroom experience inspired him to write.
    *   **Key Idea:** Legal experience, seemingly unrelated to writing, provided the inspiration and material for a successful writing career.
*   **J.K. Rowling:**
    *   Worked as a bilingual secretary and English teacher before writing Harry Potter.
*   **Haruki Murakami:**
    *   Ran a jazz bar, providing time for observation and inspiration for his writing.
    *   Didn't consider writing novels until age 29.
*   **Raymond Chandler:**
    *   Started writing at age 45 after being fired from his oil company executive job.
*   **Mary Midgley:**
    *   Didn't write books until after age 50.
*   **Key Idea (for writers):**  Diverse experiences and unexpected life changes can be valuable stepping stones for a writing career, even if they seem unrelated to the craft. 

###  Challenging the "Realistic Objectives" Mindset

*   **Pressure to be Practical:** Societal pressure often pushes individuals towards "realistic" objectives, discouraging them from following their passions.
    *   **Examples:** John Lennon and Elton John both received discouragement from family regarding their musical aspirations.
*   **"Get your head out of the clouds":** This common saying reflects a cultural bias against pursuing paths based on passion rather than practicality.
*   **Colonel Sanders:**
    *   Cooked from a young age but didn't find success until age 40 after a varied career path.
    *   **Key Idea:**  A willingness to explore different paths and embrace change ("catching the winds of serendipity") eventually led to success.

### The Common Thread: Embracing Change

*   **Successful individuals often deviate from initial paths:**  Whether self-chosen or imposed, original objectives can transform into stepping stones towards something unforeseen.
*   **Openness to 180-degree turns:**  A willingness to abandon initial goals and seize opportunities is a common characteristic of highly successful people.
*   **Serendipity is widespread:** A study found that nearly two-thirds of adults attribute some aspect of their career choice to serendipity.
    *   **Example:** "I happened to visit an animal hospital and became interested in veterinary medicine."

###  Career Experts Acknowledge Serendipity

*   **Shifting Focus:** Some career experts are recognizing the importance of unplanned experiences in career development.
*   **Encouraging Exploration:**  Activities like volunteering, joining clubs, and networking are recommended to increase chances of serendipitous encounters.
*   **Emphasis on the Unplanned:**  This approach moves away from rigid career planning and emphasizes exploration without a fixed destination.

### The Non-Objective Principle: Beyond Careers

*   **Applicability:** The principle of "finding without trying to find" extends beyond careers to any search process, including personal discoveries.
*   **Openness to Change:**  Embracing a flexible mindset and recognizing that appearances can be deceiving is crucial.
*   **Recognizing Potential:**  Sensing potential in unexpected areas, even without a clear understanding of its nature, can lead to significant discoveries.

###  Cultural Echoes of the Non-Objective Principle

*   **Love as an Example:** The paradoxical nature of finding love is widely acknowledged.
    *   **Loretta Young:**  "Love isn't something you find. Love is something that finds you."
    *   **D.H. Lawrence:**  "Those that go searching for love, only manifest their own lovelessness... only the loving find love. And they never have to seek for it."
*   **The deceptive nature of ideals:**  Preconceived notions about ideal outcomes often lead to disappointment, highlighting the unpredictable nature of great discoveries.
*   **The Surprise of Love Stories:**  Love stories often emphasize the unexpected and unplanned nature of finding happiness, contrasting with traditional goal-oriented approaches.
    *   **Example:**  Calvin and Grace Coolidge's unconventional first encounter.

###  Hobbies and Recreation: Embracing the Unplanned

*   **Hobbies chosen for enjoyment:**  Unlike careers, hobbies are often pursued without a specific objective, providing intrinsic satisfaction.
    *   **Examples of unusual hobbies:** Snail racing, underwater hockey, limbo skating, extreme unicycling, extreme ironing.
*   **Hobbies as Stepping Stones:**  Some hobbies can unexpectedly evolve into successful careers.
    *   **Example:** Nathan Sawaya, a corporate attorney, turned his Lego building hobby into a full-time career.
*   **The Value of "Pointless" Pursuits:**  Activities without a clear objective can still have significant benefits.
    *   **Example:** Joseph Herscher's Rube Goldberg machines, initially created for entertainment, gained widespread recognition and led to media appearances.
*   **Unstructured Play:** Psychologists recognize the importance of unstructured play for children's development, suggesting a similar need for adults.
*   **The Potential for Unexpected Discoveries:**  "Pointless" pursuits can lead to unforeseen solutions or innovations.
    *   **Example:** Marcelino de Sautuola's caving and artifact hobbies led to the discovery of ancient cave paintings.

###  Pivoting and Adapting in Business

*   **Internet Businesses:**  Many successful online ventures evolved from initial concepts through pivoting and adapting to user behavior.
    *   **Example:** YouTube, initially envisioned as a video dating site, transitioned to video sharing.
    *   **Example:** Flickr, a photo-sharing service, emerged from a larger social online game.
*   **Nintendo:** 
    *   Started in 1889 selling playing cards.
    *   Explored diverse ventures (taxi service, hotels, instant rice, toys) before finding success in electronic toys and video games.
    *   **Key Idea:**  Adapting to changing markets and embracing new opportunities led to Nintendo's eventual dominance in the video game industry.

###  The Right to Follow Your Passions

*   **Embrace serendipity:**  Be willing to deviate from original plans and follow passions, even if they seem to conflict with initial objectives.
*   **Acknowledge the unknown:** Recognize that the path to happiness and fulfillment is often unpredictable.
*   **Value stepping stones:**  View seemingly unrelated experiences as potential stepping stones towards something greater.
*   **Trust your intuition:** Be open to following a path that feels right, even without a clear objective justification. 

### Conclusion

*   **Success often arises from embracing the unplanned:**  Many great achievements result from a willingness to deviate from initial objectives and follow unexpected opportunities.
*   **Openness and flexibility are key:**  A rigid adherence to predetermined plans can hinder serendipitous discoveries and limit potential.
*   **Follow your passions:**  Embrace activities that resonate with you, even if they don't seem to have a clear objective or practical application. 
*   **Recognize the value of stepping stones:**  Seemingly unrelated experiences can be crucial stepping stones towards unexpected and fulfilling outcomes. 







## Chapter 3: The Art of Breeding Art

### Introduction: Questioning Objectives

*   **The book challenges the common assumption that having an objective is always beneficial.**
*   The authors, AI researchers, initially embraced objectives like everyone else. 
*   Their research on Picbreeder, a website for breeding pictures, led them to question the value of objectives.
*   Quote: "This book is about questioning the value of objectives."

### [Picbreeder](https://nbenko1.github.io/#/): A Novel Experiment

*   **Picbreeder was designed as a website where users could "breed" pictures, similar to animal breeding.**
*   The idea was to allow users to create visually appealing images through an evolutionary process, even without artistic skills.
*   **Genetic Art:** Pictures are assigned artificial "DNA," allowing them to be bred like animals (first introduced by Richard Dawkins).
*   Users select "parent" pictures based on their preferences, influencing the characteristics of the next generation.
*   **Branching:** Users can continue breeding images evolved by others, enabling evolution over many generations.

### The Role of Objectives in Picbreeder

*   **Objectives in Picbreeder relate to the desired outcome of the breeding process (e.g., evolving a face or an animal).**
*   Surprisingly, users achieved the best results when they were not explicitly focused on a specific objective.
*   **Serendipity played a crucial role in major discoveries on Picbreeder.**

### Picbreeder's Mechanics and Discoveries

*   **Picbreeder allows users to start from scratch (random blobs) or branch from existing images.**
*   **Starting from scratch:**
    *   Users select parent blobs from a randomly generated set.
    *   Evolution progresses as users repeatedly choose parents for subsequent generations.
*   **Branching:**
    *   Users can continue evolving images published by other users.
    *   This extends the evolutionary process beyond the typical attention span of a single user.
*   **Despite starting from simple blobs, Picbreeder users evolved remarkably complex and compelling images.**
*   These discoveries were made by non-artists who were simply exploring the platform.

### The Paradox of Objectives in Picbreeder

*   **It's often impossible to breed a specific image if it's set as an objective.**
*   Even images previously discovered on Picbreeder cannot be reliably reproduced when targeted directly.
*   Computer simulations confirmed this: programs attempting to evolve towards a target image consistently failed.
*   **Discoveries happen when the desired image is *not* the objective.**

### The Car Example: Serendipity in Action

*   Ken Stanley (one of the authors) discovered the "Car" image on Picbreeder.
*   **Ken was not trying to breed a car; he started from an "Alien Face" image and aimed to breed more alien faces.**
*   **Serendipity:** Random mutations caused the alien's eyes to gradually descend, eventually resembling wheels.
*   This unexpected stepping stone led to the discovery of the Car.

### Stepping Stones and Open Minds

*   **Most attractive images on Picbreeder were discovered through serendipitous stepping stones.**
*   The stepping stones rarely resemble the final product.
*   **Picbreeder's success stems from its lack of a unified objective.** Users follow individual instincts, laying stepping stones for others.
*   **The most successful users are those with open minds, who avoid fixating on a specific objective.**

### Implications Beyond Picbreeder

*   **The principle observed on Picbreeder may apply to other areas of life:**
    *   Focusing too much on a distant objective might cause us to miss crucial stepping stones.
    *   Stepping stones may not resemble the final destination.
*   **The distant objective can be a misleading guide.**

### Conclusion

*   Abandoning objectives is often the best strategy for achieving significant breakthroughs.
*   This is because stepping stones rarely resemble the final destination, regardless of whether it was planned.
*   The next chapter will explore the reasons behind this pattern and explain why distant objectives can be deceptive.



## Chapter 4: The False Compass

### Introduction: The Problem of Stepping Stones in a Fog

*   **Stepping stones** represent the necessary waypoints to reach an objective in a large, uncharted search space.
*   The challenge of search and discovery is that we usually don't know the stepping stones to the objective at the outset.
*   **Ambitious objectives** are particularly difficult because their solutions are multiple stepping stones away, making them hard to predict.
*   The human condition is akin to being marooned on a stepping stone with limited foresight.

### The Deception of Objective Functions

*   **Objective functions** (measures of progress) are used to track progress towards objectives.
*   The assumption that improving objective function scores guarantees progress towards the objective is often **wrong**.
*   **Deception** occurs when the objective function is a false compass, meaning it may not register progress even when moving closer to the objective.
*   **Example:** The Chinese finger trap, where moving away from freedom (pushing inward) is the stepping stone to achieving freedom.
*   Ambitious problems are likely to involve multiple deceptive stepping stones.
*   **Deception is universal** in complex problems because the stepping stones to solve them are not obvious.
*   **Examples:** Chess moves that seem promising but lead to trouble, vacuum tubes leading to computers, ragtime leading to rock and roll.

### Non-Objective Systems of Discovery: Picbreeder, Evolution, and Innovation

#### Picbreeder: A Stepping-Stone Collector

*   Picbreeder has no final objective; it's a **stepping-stone collector**, creating the potential for finding more stepping stones.
*   Collecting stepping stones is not about pursuing a specific objective but about creating a road to everywhere.

#### Natural Evolution: A Non-Objective Process

*   **Thought experiment:** Evolving human-level intelligence from single-celled organisms in a Petri dish.
*   **Flawed strategy:** Administering intelligence tests to single-celled organisms and selecting the highest scorers for reproduction.
*   **Reason for failure:** Stepping stones to intelligence (e.g., multicellularity, bilateral symmetry) do not resemble intelligence.
*   Human-level intelligence is a **deceptive objective** for evolution.
*   **Evolution's success:** It did not try to evolve human-level intelligence.
*   **Nature as a stepping-stone collector:** Organisms reproduce based on their success in their own niche, not based on their potential to lead to humans.
*   **Examples of non-objective outcomes:** Flight, photosynthesis, the human mind were not objectives of evolution but arose as byproducts.

#### Survive and Reproduce: A Constraint, Not an Objective

*   The common belief that evolution's objective is to survive and reproduce is misleading.
*   **Constraints vs. Objectives:** Survive and reproduce is a minimal criterion for continued evolution, not a well-defined product to be produced.
*   Every organism in the lineage leading to humans satisfied the "survive and reproduce" constraint, making it an odd type of objective.
*   **Survive and reproduce as a constraint:** It allows evolution to identify successful organisms that may lead to other successful organisms, facilitating stepping-stone collection.

#### Human Innovation: A Non-Objective Process

*   **Thought experiment:** Gathering brilliant minds 5,000 years ago to build a computer.
*   **Reason for failure:** The stepping stones to computers (e.g., vacuum tubes, electricity) were not yet discovered.
*   **Deceptive objective:** Focusing on the computer diverts attention from pursuing the necessary prerequisites.
*   **Hypothesis about invention:** Almost no prerequisite to any major invention was invented with that invention in mind.
*   **Example:** The Wright brothers' invention of the airplane relied on pre-existing innovations like the internal combustion engine, which was not invented with flight in mind.
*   **The chain of innovation:** Each link (e.g., induction coil, internal combustion engine, airplane) was not invented with the next link in mind.
*   **Great invention:** Recognizing that existing stepping stones, laid by predecessors with unrelated ambitions, can be combined and enhanced to reach a new stepping stone.
*   **Human innovation as a stepping-stone collector:** The tree of human innovation grows outward, driven by individual pursuits and discoveries, leading to unexpected outcomes.

### The Disconnect Between the Myth of the Objective and Reality

*   **Conventional wisdom:** We're supposed to know our dreams and strive for them with passion and commitment.
*   **Reality:** Ambitious objectives often lead to deception and failure because the stepping stones do not resemble the final destination.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Evolving intelligence by measuring intelligence is flawed.
    *   Building a computer without the necessary stepping stones is impossible.
    *   Becoming rich solely by seeking a higher salary is unlikely.
*   **The power of ignoring objectives:**  Astonishing achievements often occur when the objective is ignored, and exploration is allowed to roam freely.
*   **Ambitious objectives vs. Stepping Stones:** Objectives close at hand can be pursued effectively, but ambitious objectives require a different approach.
*   **The paradox of search:** The world's greatest compass can lead us astray, while a form of ignorance (not being fixated on a distant objective) can be surprisingly powerful.

### Conclusion: Embracing Non-Objective Search

*   The disconnect between conventional wisdom and the reality of search presents an opportunity.
*   We can leverage the way the world really works (stepping-stone collection) to our advantage.
*   The next chapter will explore how to play the game of discovery on its own terms, without relying on the false compass of objectives.
*   This approach involves embracing untamed, wild, and unfamiliar exploration. 



## Chapter 5: The Interesting and the Novel

### Introduction: The Problem with Objectives

*   **Anecdote:** New Year's resolutions often fail because people focus on the end goal without identifying the steps to get there. 
*   **Central Argument:** Instead of focusing on objectives, we should focus on identifying and exploring **novel stepping stones**, even if they don't directly lead to a pre-defined objective.
    *   **Novelty:** Discovering something genuinely new that can potentially lead to further novelties.
    *   **Stepping Stone:** A discovery or development that opens up new possibilities and avenues for exploration.

### Judging Progress by Novelty, Not Objectives

*   **Problem with Objectives:**
    *   **Preoccupation with the future:** We constantly compare our present state to an idealized future objective.
    *   **Deception:** Objectives can be misleading and may not reveal the necessary stepping stones (e.g., air travel and induction coils).
*   **Solution: Comparing to the Past:**
    *   **The past is a guide to novelty:** We can objectively compare our current state to our past, identifying how we've deviated and created something new.
    *   **Focus on escaping the outdated:** This opens up new possibilities and potential stepping stones.

### The Power of Novelty and Interestingness

*   **Novelty as a Stepping Stone Detector:** Novel discoveries are potential stepping stones to further novelties.
*   **Interestingness:**
    *   **Definition:** Interesting ideas open up new possibilities.
    *   **Philosophical Significance:**
        *   Alfred Whitehead: "It is more important that a proposition be interesting than it be true."
        *   W.T. Stace: "The criticism that interestingness is a trivial end proceeds from a scale of values thus perverted and turned upside down."
*   **Compounding Novelty:** Continually seeking novelty creates an endless chain of stepping stones, branching out into an open future.
*   **Examples:** Picbreeder, natural evolution, and human innovation illustrate this **ratcheting process** of building upon stepping stones without a specific end goal.

### Embracing the Unknown: Novelty Search

*   **Fear of Aimlessness:** Searching for novelty might seem unanchored and random.
*   **Information in Novelty:**
    *   Novelty provides information about how something is different from the past.
    *   This information is arguably more plentiful and reliable than information provided by an objective (which can be deceptive).
*   **Human Sensitivity to Novelty:** We are naturally drawn to explore novel paths and ideas, even without knowing where they might lead.
    *   **Intuition and Hunches:** These can guide us towards interesting and novel directions.

### The Myth of Serendipity

*   **Traditional View:** Serendipity is seen as accidental, like a mad scientist stumbling upon a breakthrough.
*   **Reality:** Most serendipitous discoveries are made by intelligent, educated, and accomplished individuals who have a **strong intuition for what is interesting**.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Isaac Newton: Observing an apple falling led to the discovery of the universal law of gravitation.
    *   Louis Pasteur: Made accidental discoveries like chiral molecules and bacterial vaccines.
    *   Archimedes: Eureka moment in the bathtub led to understanding displacement and volume.
*   **Prepared Minds:**
    *   These individuals were able to recognize the significance of their observations and connect them to broader concepts.
    *   Louis Pasteur: "In the fields of observation chance favors only the prepared mind."

### Formalizing Novelty Search: An Algorithm Without an Objective

*   **Algorithms:**
    *   Traditional View: Recipes for solving specific problems.
    *   Broader Definition: A way of clearly describing a process, with or without an objective.
*   **Novelty Search Algorithm:** Formalizes the process of searching for novelty as a computer program.
*   **Domain:** The specific area or category within which the algorithm searches for novelty (e.g., art, music, robot behaviors).
*   **Robot Behavior Example:**
    *   **Traditional Approach (Objective-Driven):** A robot learns to navigate a hallway to reach an open door by incrementally improving its ability to move closer to the door.
    *   **Novelty Search Approach:**
        *   The robot seeks novel behaviors, initially crashing into walls in various ways.
        *   By exhausting simple behaviors, it eventually learns to avoid walls and navigate the hallway to find further novelties, eventually reaching the door even though it wasn't an objective.

### The Order of Discovery in Novelty Search

*   **Traditional Objective-Driven Search:** Expects an order from bad to good behavior, with incremental improvements towards the objective.
*   **Problem with Bad-to-Good Ordering:**
    *   **Deceptive Problems:** Like the Chinese finger trap, progress may require temporarily moving away from the objective (from bad to worse before getting better).
*   **Novelty Search Ordering:** From simple to complex behaviors.
    *   **Novelty is Context-Dependent:** What is considered novel changes over time as new behaviors are discovered.
    *   **Simplicity to Complexity:**
        *   Initially, simple behaviors (requiring little knowledge of the world) are novel.
        *   To continue finding novelty, the search must learn about the world and produce increasingly complex behaviors.

### Novelty Search as an Information Accumulator

*   **Information Accumulation:** Both novelty search and other non-objective searches (like natural evolution) accumulate information about the world as they progress from simple to complex.
*   **Natural Evolution:**
    *   Increasing complexity is driven by the need to find new niches and species as simple options are exhausted.
    *   Organisms reflect aspects of the world in their structure and behavior (e.g., eyes reflect light, lungs reflect oxygen).
    *   Evolution can be seen as a process of accumulating information about the universe.
*   **Picbreeder:** Reflects aspects of the human world (its environment) by discovering familiar themes like faces, butterflies, and castles.
*   **Novelty Search:** The robot in the hallway example illustrates how it must learn about walls and doors to continue finding novel behaviors.

### Constraints and Meaningfulness in Novelty Search

*   **Concern:** Without an objective, novelty search might explore meaningless behaviors.
*   **World as a Constraint:**
    *   Physical laws limit the space of possible behaviors.
    *   Many imaginable behaviors are impossible in reality (e.g., walking through walls).
*   **Information Accumulation and Meaning:**
    *   Behaviors that respect the laws of physics and exploit how the world works are better stepping stones to further novelty.
    *   Novelty search tends to focus on meaningful behaviors because they lead to more possibilities.

### Novelty as an Objective: A Misinterpretation

*   **Argument:** Some argue that novelty itself is an objective.
*   **Problems with this View:**
    *   **Achieving Novelty is Different from Achieving an Objective:** With novelty, the specific outcome is not the goal.
    *   **Novelty is Fleeting:**  What is novel quickly becomes less novel, unlike achieving a fixed objective.
    *   **Multiple Fulfillments:** A novelty-driven search might achieve "novelty" many times before reaching a specific outcome, making it unclear how that outcome fulfills the "objective".
*   **Distinction is Important:** Using the word "objective" for both traditional goals and novelty muddles the important differences between them.
*   **Similarities to "Survive and Reproduce":** Both are constraints rather than objectives, can be satisfied from the beginning, and lead to discoveries that weren't initially intended.

### Divergence and Novelty Search

*   **Objectives and Convergence:** Objectives naturally lead to convergence, limiting exploration of other possibilities.
*   **Novelty Search and Divergence:** Without objectives, novelty search can branch out in many directions, exploring a wider range of possibilities.
*   **Divergent Thinking and Creativity:** Divergent thinking is associated with finding novel and surprising solutions that others miss.

### Testing Novelty Search: The Robot Maze Experiment

*   **Scientific Approach:** Implement novelty search as a computer algorithm to test its effectiveness.
*   **Robot Maze Simulation:**
    *   The computer simulates a robot in a maze.
    *   The program generates new robot behaviors.
    *   Novel behaviors are considered "good" and explored further by making slight modifications.
*   **Results:**
    *   **Novelty Search:** Successfully found maze-solving behaviors in 39 out of 40 trials.
    *   **Objective-Based Search:**  Succeeded in only 3 out of 40 trials.
*   **Explanation:**
    *   **Deception:** Objective-based search was misled by cul-de-sacs that appeared to be closer to the goal.
    *   **Novelty Search:** Unaffected by deception because it wasn't focused on the goal.

### Further Experiments and Applications

*   **Biped Robot:**
    *   Novelty search produced better walking gaits than objective-based search (which aimed to maximize walking distance).
    *   **Deception:** Falling down and kicking, which are stepping stones to walking, were penalized by the objective-based approach.
*   **Other Applications:**
    *   Replicating maze results.
    *   Evolving artificial ants that follow food trails.
    *   Solving deceptive problems in robot body-brain co-evolution.
    *   Finding bugs in computer programs.
    *   Evolving robots that learn and adapt.

### Limitations and the Future of Novelty Search

*   **Limitations:** Novelty search is not a universal solution and can fail in very complex problems.
*   **Maze Experiment with Varying Difficulty:**
    *   Both novelty search and objective-based search struggled with increasingly complex mazes.
    *   Objective-based search's performance declined more rapidly.
*   **No Magic Bullet:** There may not be a single method that can consistently solve all problems.
*   **Embracing Futility:** Accepting that we can't always achieve our objectives allows us to appreciate the interesting and novel discoveries made along the way, even if they don't lead to a specific destination.
*   **The Treasure Hunter:** Instead of seeking a magic bullet, we can become treasure hunters, exploring the possibilities opened up by novelty and enjoying the unexpected discoveries we make. 







## Chapter 6: Long Live the Treasure Hunter

### Introduction: The Limitations of Possibility and the Power of Novelty Search

* **Novelty search**, as discussed in previous chapters, suggests that finding objectives can sometimes be easier when not directly searching for them.
* This chapter explores the limitations of novelty search and the concept of **objectives** in problem-solving.
* It challenges the cultural notion that "anything is possible" and acknowledges the existence of limitations.
* The chapter aims to find a balance between optimism and realism when considering future possibilities.

### The Paradox of Novelty Search and the Myth of the Objective

* **Novelty search as a tool:** While novelty search can be a useful tool, it's not a universal solution. It may not work for all problems, particularly those involving vast, complex search spaces (e.g., an endless maze).
* **Myth of the objective:** Despite novelty search's successes in certain scenarios, the belief in the necessity of objectives persists.
* **Diversity as a compromise:** One argument is that objectives are still valuable but require a **diversity of ideas** during the search process to avoid being misled by deceptive paths.
* **Horse racing analogy:** This perspective is compared to betting on multiple horses in a race to increase the chances of winning, suggesting that maintaining a variety of alternatives is beneficial even when pursuing an objective.
* **Hybrid approach:** This leads to the idea of combining objective-driven search with novelty search, using the objective for guidance and novelty to prevent deception.

### The Deception of Objectives and the Futility of Search

* **Ambitious objectives and deception:** The chapter argues that the more ambitious the objective, the more deceptive it becomes. 
* **False compass analogy:** A deceptive objective acts like a compass pointing in the wrong direction, rendering open-mindedness ineffective.
* **Maze-navigating robot example:** Even in a simple maze, the objective of reaching the end can be deceptive due to walls that attract the robot based on proximity but hinder actual progress.
* **Limitations of objectives with novelty:** Combining novelty with objectives doesn't fully solve the deception problem in ambitious situations.
* **Five thousand year old computer example:** The objective of building a computer five thousand years ago would have been deeply deceptive, as the necessary stepping stones (e.g., vacuum tubes) were unimaginable at the time.
* **Futility at the heart of search:** The chapter concludes that no single search approach can guarantee reaching a specific objective, especially for highly ambitious goals.
* **Limitations of objective-driven search:** The fact that novelty search outperforms objective-driven search in some simple problems raises concerns about the latter's effectiveness in more complex scenarios.
* **No Free Lunch Theorem:** This theorem supports the idea that there's no universally best search algorithm, as improving performance on one set of problems can negatively impact performance on others.
* **Black box optimization:** This field in machine learning also acknowledges that general rules or heuristics can be misleading in specific circumstances.

### The Treasure Hunter: Embracing Discovery Without Objectives

* **Finding the unexpected:** Despite the limitations of search, the chapter argues that we can reliably find amazing things, even if we can't predefine them.
* **Great discoveries as undefined:** This idea is based on the success of Picbreeder, natural evolution, and human innovation, all of which involve processes without predefined objectives.
* **Non-objective search as a treasure hunter:** It's presented as a powerful tool for finding unexpected treasures while exploring the search space.
* **Picbreeder Car example:** The Picbreeder Car, a surprising and complex image, was discovered without anyone explicitly searching for it, demonstrating the potential of non-objective search.
* **The paradox of trying vs. not trying:** The chapter highlights the irony that actively trying to achieve a specific objective can hinder progress, while exploring without a fixed goal can lead to unexpected breakthroughs.
* **Treasure hunter's approach:** The treasure hunter collects as many stepping stones as possible, recognizing that any one of them could lead to something valuable, even if the ultimate destination is unknown.
* **Collective exploration:** The chapter emphasizes the importance of diverse individuals with different interests contributing to the exploration of the search space, rather than relying on a single objective or individual.
* **The inevitability of the future:** While the future may not unfold as planned, the continuous exploration of diverse individuals ensures that unexpected discoveries and advancements will emerge.

### Building Treasure-Hunting Systems: Harnessing Non-Objective Principles

* **Novelty search as a model:** The chapter suggests that novelty search and Picbreeder demonstrate the feasibility of building systems based on non-objective principles.
* **Human feedback and collaboration:** Human feedback, as seen in Picbreeder, can play a crucial role in guiding non-objective search and capitalizing on the diverse tastes and insights of individuals.
* **Internet as a platform for treasure hunting:** The internet provides an ideal platform for organizing and facilitating collaborative treasure hunting through interconnected systems.
* **Interactive catalog example:** The chapter presents the concept of an interactive catalog (e.g., for furniture) where users can explore and "breed" new designs based on existing ones.
* **Customer-driven design:** This system allows customers to become active participants in the design process, discovering unique and personalized products that wouldn't have been conceived through traditional methods.
* **Collaborative stepping stone collection:** The catalog evolves into a repository of user-generated designs, each potentially serving as a stepping stone for further exploration and innovation.
* **Trusting the non-objective catalog:** The chapter raises the question of whether users would trust a catalog where designs are generated through a collaborative, non-objective process rather than by expert designers.
* **The role of experts:** While acknowledging the importance of expert designers, the chapter suggests that non-objective systems can uncover hidden treasures that experts might miss due to their focus on specific objectives.
* **Potential of non-objective systems:** The chapter argues that non-objective systems, like the interactive catalog, can lead to the creation of innovative concepts that would otherwise remain undiscovered.

### Conclusion: Embracing the Futility and Power of Search

* **Relinquishing the myth of the objective:** The chapter concludes that we must accept the futility of searching for a guaranteed path to a predetermined destination, especially for ambitious goals.
* **Embracing the treasure hunter:** Instead, we should embrace the treasure hunter approach, exploring the search space without a fixed objective and collecting stepping stones that may lead to unexpected and valuable discoveries.
* **Natural evolution, human innovation, Picbreeder, and novelty search as examples:** These examples demonstrate the power and success of non-objective processes in generating innovation and progress.
* **Liberation from objectives:** Freeing ourselves from the grip of objectives can lead to a new perspective on the world and open up new possibilities for innovation and discovery.
* **Implications for society:** The next chapters will explore the implications of this non-objective perspective for how we organize and operate our society.
* **The future of innovation:** The chapter concludes with an optimistic outlook on the future of innovation, suggesting that it will be driven by the collective exploration of diverse individuals without a unified objective, leading to unexpected and exciting discoveries.



## Chapter 7: Unshackling Education

### Societal Harms of Objective Obsession

#### The Deception of Objectives

- **Campbell's law**: 

  > "The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor." - David Campbell, *Assessing the impact of planned social change*

  -   Social indicators, like academic achievement tests, become less effective when used as objectives for improvement.
  -   Focusing on simple metrics can lead to **deception**, as they often fail to capture the essence of the desired outcome.
      -   Example: Judging teachers based on student test scores encourages teaching to the test, resulting in students who are good at test-taking but lack meaningful knowledge.

#### GDP Fetishism

-   **GDP (gross domestic product)**, a measure of national productivity, is often treated as a national objective.
-   **GDP fetishism**: The tendency to overemphasize GDP as the primary indicator of economic health.
-   Increasing GDP doesn't guarantee a healthy economy.
    -   Policies that boost GDP in the short term may be detrimental in the long run.
    -   GDP is a simple measure that fails to capture the complexity of a healthy economy.

#### Perverse Incentives

-   **Perverse incentives**: When rewards or measures intended to improve a situation actually make it worse.
    -   Examples:
        -   Paying citizens for dead snakes in India led to cobra breeding.
        -   Paying for rat tails in Hanoi led to rat farming.
        -   Campaigns to reduce alcohol or drug abuse can lead to the abuse of more dangerous substances.
        -   Paying workers for dinosaur bone fragments led to the destruction of whole bones.
        -   Paying executives with bonuses for higher earnings can incentivize short-term profits at the expense of long-term stability.

### The Myth of the Objective in Education

#### The Aimless Youth vs. The Overachiever

- The **aimless youth**, with no clear career goals, is often seen as a negative stereotype.

- The **overachiever**, driven by ambitious career objectives, may be more susceptible to **deception**.

  -   Focusing on distant career aspirations as objectives can lead to pursuing steps that don't actually contribute to achieving the desired outcome.

- The aimless youth, unburdened by specific objectives, has the freedom to explore and discover interesting paths.

  - Example: Steve Jobs dropping out of college and exploring courses that interested him.

    - > "After six months, I couldn’t see the value in it...So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay...The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting."

#### Assessing Schools Based on Standardized Tests

-   Assessing schools based on standardized test scores can lead to **deception**.
    -   Example: No Child Left Behind Act in Florida setting annual measurable objectives (AMO) for student proficiency in reading and mathematics.
        -   The assumption is that increasing test scores indicate progress towards the objective of near-perfect proficiency.
        -   However, this approach can lead to a focus on teaching to the test rather than fostering genuine understanding.
-   The complexity of education makes it unlikely that simple metrics like standardized test scores can accurately reflect progress towards ambitious objectives.

#### The Software Engineering Analogy

-   Early software engineering embraced metrics to improve productivity and quality.
    -   "You can't control what you can't measure." - Tom DeMarco, *Controlling software projects*
-   DeMarco later acknowledged the limitations of metrics in complex software projects.
    -   "Metrics...must be used with careful moderation."
    -   Strict control through metrics is only appropriate for projects with modest goals.
-   The obsession with metrics in software engineering led to engineers focusing on improving measurements rather than addressing underlying issues.
-   A similar situation may be occurring in the US educational system, with teachers and students pressured to improve test scores at the expense of genuine learning.

#### The Illusion of Accuracy in Assessment

-   The push for more accurate assessments in education, like the Race to the Top initiative, is based on the assumption that accuracy improves performance in objective-driven pursuits.
-   However, **accuracy doesn't necessarily lead to better outcomes in complex search spaces**.
    -   Example: The Picbreeder Skull image evolved through stepping stones that didn't resemble the final image.
        -   Even with accurate assessment of "Skull-ness," an objective-driven approach would have failed to discover the Skull because the stepping stones looked nothing like it.
-   Accuracy becomes meaningless when the underlying compass (objective) is flawed.

#### The Pitfalls of Uniform Standards

-   The drive towards uniform standards, like the Common Core State Standards Initiative, aims to ensure equal access to quality education and facilitate comparisons.
-   However, uniformity can hinder progress by:
    -   **Potentially adopting a flawed standard**: Even a well-chosen standard may be rooted in the myth of the objective.
    -   **Extinguishing diversity**: Uniformity eliminates alternative standards that individual schools or states might be exploring, limiting future innovation.
-   Uniformity doesn't guarantee better outcomes and can stifle progress by reducing the diversity of approaches.

### Non-Objective Thinking in Education

#### Embracing the Treasure Hunter

-   The alternative to objective deception in education is to adopt the **treasure hunter** approach.
-   Instead of focusing on assessments tied to ambitious objectives, we can encourage exploration and the sharing of diverse ideas.
-   Example: Replacing standardized tests with teacher portfolios assessed by peer review.
    -   Teachers create portfolios showcasing their teaching methods, student work, etc.
    -   Portfolios are anonymously reviewed by other teachers.
    -   Standardized tests are only administered if a teacher's portfolio receives a failing grade.
-   This approach fosters a culture of sharing and learning from each other's experiences, promoting innovation and creativity.

#### Shifting the Focus from Assessment to Exploration

-   Instead of prioritizing assessment, we can reframe education as a **treasure hunt** for the best teaching approaches.
-   This shift requires:
    -   Reducing the emphasis on standardized tests.
    -   Empowering teachers to utilize their creativity and intuition.
    -   Encouraging experimentation and the exploration of diverse methods.
-   Finland's education system, which grants greater autonomy to teachers and doesn't impose standardized tests, serves as an example of a non-objective approach.

#### Embracing Uncertainty

-   Rejecting the myth of the objective in education requires embracing uncertainty.
-   We must accept that there may not be a single, objective solution to achieving exceptional education for all students.
-   By focusing on exploration, diversity, and the sharing of ideas, we can foster a more dynamic and innovative educational landscape.





## Chapter 8: Unchaining Innovation

### Introduction: The Allure of Exploration and the Myth of the Objective

*   The chapter opens with captivating stories of early explorers like Magellan, Verrazzano, and Scott who braved the unknown, highlighting the inherent risks and potential rewards of exploration.
*   **Innovation**, particularly in science, is presented as a modern form of exploration with the power to reshape society.
*   The chapter aims to explore how the **myth of the objective** hinders innovation in various fields, including science, business, and art.
*   The rapid pace of scientific progress is emphasized through examples like George Washington's letter-writing predicament and the evolution of communication from handwritten letters to real-time video chats. 
*   The chapter acknowledges that scientific exploration may not be as visually thrilling as geographical expeditions, but the discoveries it yields can be equally transformative, potentially leading to advancements like a universal cure for cancer or cheap energy through nuclear fusion.
*   The chapter establishes that the pursuit of scientific innovation is often constrained by the **myth of the objective**, particularly in funding decisions, which tend to prioritize projects with clear objectives and predictable outcomes.


### The Problem with Consensus in Science Funding

*   **Science funding** is identified as a key area where the myth of the objective plays a significant role.
*   Government funding agencies like the NSF and ESF rely on **peer review** to evaluate grant proposals, favoring projects that achieve consensus among expert reviewers.
*   The chapter argues that **consensus can be detrimental to innovation** because it discourages exploration of diverse and potentially groundbreaking ideas.
*   **Picbreeder** is used as an analogy to illustrate how consensus can stifle creativity.
    *   Picbreeder's success in generating novel images stems from the fact that users are free to explore diverse paths without needing to agree on which images are "better."
    *   If a panel of experts were to vote on the next image in Picbreeder, the number of explored paths would be severely limited.
*   The chapter suggests that **rewarding disagreement** instead of consensus might be a more effective strategy for promoting innovation.
    *   Unanimous agreement on a project might indicate that it merely echoes the status quo.
    *   **Interesting ideas are more likely to split expert opinions** because they often challenge existing paradigms and explore uncharted territory.
    *   Examples like Darwin's theory of evolution and Thomas Kuhn's concept of paradigm shifts are cited to demonstrate how groundbreaking ideas initially faced resistance from the scientific community.
*   The chapter clarifies that it's not advocating for funding all projects with disagreement, but rather suggesting that some resources should be allocated to support **interesting and potentially transformative research**, even if it lacks consensus.
*   The emphasis on consensus in science funding is linked to **objective thinking**, which prioritizes reaching a predetermined destination over exploring diverse and potentially serendipitous paths.
*   The chapter concludes that **science needs to embrace the role of a treasure hunter and a stepping stone collector**, allowing researchers to explore diverse and unpredictable paths rather than being solely focused on achieving predefined objectives.


### The Illusion of Predictable Scientific Progress and Impact

*   The myth of the objective leads to the assumption that scientific progress is predictable and that the stepping stones to important discoveries can be laid out in an orderly fashion.
*   The chapter challenges this assumption by highlighting the **serendipitous nature of many scientific breakthroughs**.
*   **Grand, objective-driven projects** aimed at solving specific problems are discussed, with examples like Japan's Fifth Generation Computer Systems project and the War on Cancer.
    *   These projects, despite significant funding and targeted research, often fail to achieve their stated objectives or produce unexpected outcomes.
*   The chapter acknowledges that some ambitious projects, like the space race, can be successful, but emphasizes that such success often relies on **pre-existing stepping stones** developed outside the scope of the project itself.
*   The chapter argues that **predicting the impact of scientific research is challenging** and that focusing solely on projects with perceived high impact can be short-sighted.
    *   Many important discoveries are unexpected and may not seem immediately impactful.
    *   **Interesting research, even if not deemed immediately important, can lead to unanticipated breakthroughs in the future**.
*   **Picbreeder and novelty search** are again used as analogies to illustrate how systems can produce remarkable results even when individual components are not evaluated based on their progress towards a specific objective.
*   The chapter suggests that funding agencies should consider supporting **interesting and potentially transformative research**, even if its immediate impact is unclear.
*   Examples from pure mathematics, such as group theory and public-key cryptography, are provided to demonstrate how seemingly "useless" research can later have significant practical applications.
*   The chapter cautions against **funding science based solely on its alignment with specific national interests or short-term economic goals**.
    *   This approach can stifle basic research and limit the potential for serendipitous discoveries.
    *   The chapter criticizes policies that prioritize research with immediate economic benefits over curiosity-driven exploration.
*   The chapter concludes that while scientific progress is possible, it is not always predictable, and that embracing **curiosity-driven research** and exploring diverse paths is essential for achieving transformative breakthroughs.


### Embracing Risk and Uncertainty in Scientific Funding

*   The chapter argues that **objectives can hinder scientific progress by promoting risk aversion**.
*   Funding agencies often require researchers to clearly define objectives and demonstrate a high likelihood of success, which can discourage exploration of risky but potentially groundbreaking ideas.
*   The chapter suggests that **some research should be pursued simply because it's interesting**, even if the potential outcomes are uncertain.
*   The chapter proposes funding researchers with a track record of interesting discoveries without requiring them to specify detailed objectives, similar to the MacArthur Fellowships.
*   The chapter acknowledges that **risk is inherent in scientific research**, and that embracing uncertainty is necessary for achieving significant progress.
*   The chapter draws a parallel between **business investing and scientific funding**.
    *   In business, investors tend to favor projects with **realistic, short-term objectives** that are achievable within a few stepping stones.
    *   **Innovative business ideas** often reveal nearby stepping stones that were previously unseen, but investors typically require a clear understanding of these stepping stones before providing funding.
*   The example of Tesla Motors is used to illustrate how **innovation in business can arise from unexpected combinations of existing technologies**.
*   The chapter concludes that both scientists and businesspeople should focus on exploring **nearby stepping stones** rather than setting overly ambitious long-term objectives.
*   **Innovation often arises from unexpected discoveries** made while exploring seemingly unrelated paths.


### The Role of Objectives in Art and Design

*   The chapter suggests that **artists and designers** have a more intuitive understanding of the myth of the objective compared to scientists or businesspeople.
*   **Art is often driven by creative exploration** rather than the pursuit of specific objectives.
*   The chapter acknowledges that **objectives can play a role in design**, particularly when functionality and safety are concerned.
    *   These objectives are compared to the **constraints faced by organisms in natural evolution**, which must survive and reproduce but can do so in a vast array of ways.
*   The chapter argues that **innovation in art and design often involves finding new ways to work within existing constraints**.
*   Examples from art history, such as the evolution from Impressionism to Expressionism to Surrealism, are used to demonstrate how **new artistic movements often arise unexpectedly** from the exploration of previous styles.
*   The chapter highlights that **individual artists may also struggle with the pressure to justify their work in terms of objectives**.
    *   The example of an art student who created sculptures by beating metal with an axe and rusting them is used to illustrate this point.
*   The chapter concludes that **art is valuable for its own sake** and for the potential it has to inspire future creative explorations.


### Conclusion: Embracing Non-Objective Thinking for a Brighter Future

*   The chapter reiterates the **pervasiveness of objective thinking** in various aspects of our lives, from education and science to art and design.
*   The chapter emphasizes that **non-objective thinking is not a universal solution**, but rather an alternative approach that can lead to greater creativity and innovation in certain contexts.
*   **Escaping the myth of the objective** can be challenging but potentially rewarding, as it allows for exploration of diverse and unpredictable paths.
*   The chapter encourages readers to **consider the potential of non-objective thinking** in their own lives and endeavors.
*   The chapter concludes with a call to **embrace the uncertainty and freedom** that comes with abandoning the rigid pursuit of predefined objectives.
*   The chapter suggests that **non-objective thinking can help us move forward** and achieve breakthroughs in various fields, acting as a stepping stone towards a brighter future. 
*   The book concludes with two case studies exploring non-objective thinking in the context of natural evolution and AI research (found after the book's main conclusion). 





## Chapter 9: Farewell to the Mirage

### Introduction: The Problem with Objectives

* **Objectives**, especially ambitious ones, can hinder progress in various fields, from education to scientific research. 
  * Overemphasis on objectives often leads to suboptimal outcomes.
  * Examples include stifling creativity in education and biasing funding decisions in science.
* This book challenges the conventional wisdom that objectives are essential for success, particularly in ambitious endeavors.
* It proposes a **non-objective perspective**, suggesting that focusing on what we love and believe in can lead to more significant achievements.

### Beyond Objectives: Embracing a New Perspective

* **Ambitious objectives** are the focus of this critique, not everyday objectives like following a recipe or meeting a project deadline.
* The authors argue that objectives become less effective when we aim for breakthroughs, deep insights, or radical innovation in areas such as:
  * Scientific discoveries (e.g., cures for diseases)
  * Artistic creations (e.g., beautiful structures, soul-stirring melodies)
  * Technological advancements (e.g., travel beyond the stars)
* In these ambitious domains, objectives can become deceptive, hindering our potential.

### The Stepping Stone Principle: A Paradoxical Approach to Achievement

* The book proposes a **paradoxical approach**: We can achieve ambitious outcomes by *not* directly aiming for them.
* **Evolution** serves as a prime example: 
  * It produced complex organisms without a predetermined objective.
  * Humans have created incredible machines without initially envisioning the final product.
* This approach involves **conceding control of the final destination** and focusing on the process of discovery.

### The Illusion of Control: Objectives as Deceptive Guides

* **Ambitious objectives often offer an illusion of control.**
  * They may seem like a roadmap to success, but they can lead us down unproductive paths.
  * The complexity of the search space makes it impossible to predict the steps required for groundbreaking discoveries.
* Examples:
  * No breeder could have intentionally steered evolution from single-celled organisms to complex brains.
  * No Stone Age human could have conceived of a computer.
* **Conceding control of the destination is like discarding a faulty compass.**
  * Great achievements often seem mysterious because there's no clear, predictable path to them.
  * Objectives can become mere good luck charms, providing a false sense of direction.

### The Treasure Hunter: Embracing Interestingness and Novelty

* **The alternative to objective-driven pursuit is to become a treasure hunter.**
  * This involves exploring the unknown and seeking out valuable discoveries, even if they weren't the initial target.
  * **Stepping stones** are the key: One good idea leads to another, creating a chain of discoveries.
* **Clues** guide the treasure hunter, but these clues are not about the objective itself. Instead, they indicate the potential for something worthwhile nearby.
  * **Novelty** can be a clue: Something new may lead to something even newer.
    * Novelty search algorithms in robotics demonstrate this principle: Robots discover complex behaviors by pursuing novelty.
  * **Interestingness** is another crucial clue, particularly for humans:
    * We are drawn to things that pique our interest, whether it's music, writing, or exploration.
    * Interestingness is subjective and varies among individuals, but this diversity benefits society.
    * Following interestingness leads us across unique chains of stepping stones.

### Interestingness: A Principled Guide in the Unknown

* **Following interestingness** may seem subjective, but it can be a more effective principle than objectivity, especially in the pursuit of discovery and innovation.
* The book provides numerous examples where ignoring objectives led to superior results compared to pursuing them.
* **Justification for following interestingness:**
  * We don't know the structure of the search space, so we can't predict which discoveries will be crucial stepping stones.
  * Interestingness forms a network of interconnected discoveries, leading us from one valuable finding to another.
* **Objectives, in contrast, act as false beacons, limiting our exploration to a single, predetermined direction.**

### The Innovator's Mindset: Focusing on the Edge of the Possible

* True innovators don't focus on distant, grandiose visions. Instead, they concentrate on the **edge of what's currently possible**.
* They ask: "Where can we get from here?" rather than "How can we get there?"
* They build upon existing capabilities and knowledge, taking small but significant steps forward.
* **Examples:**
  * **Markus "Notch" Persson** created Minecraft by combining elements from existing games, resulting in a groundbreaking success despite its unconventional design.
  * **Steve Jobs** and Apple recognized the opportune moment for a commercially viable tablet computer (the iPad), capitalizing on existing technological advancements and societal trends.
  * **The Wright brothers** built upon their expertise in bicycles to achieve flight, demonstrating that stepping stones can come from unexpected sources.
* **Objective-driven companies** often struggle, clinging to ambitious visions that are not yet feasible.
* **Success often comes from recognizing the potential in the present**, rather than trying to force a preconceived future into existence.

### Embracing Divergence: Letting Go of the "Right Path"

* **Letting go of objectives also means abandoning the idea of a single "right path."**
* Instead of judging projects based on their likelihood of achieving a specific objective, we should assess their **potential to spawn new projects, new stepping stones.**
* **The value of a stepping stone lies in its ability to lead to further exploration, regardless of its immediate outcome.**
* **Divergence is a virtue:** 
  * Different people pursuing different paths lead to a greater diversity of discoveries.
  * Consensus can stifle innovation by limiting the exploration of alternative approaches.
* **The world is too complex to know with certainty which path is "right" in the long run.**
* **Embracing diverse paths allows for a wider range of possibilities to be explored.**

### Following Your Instinct: The Power of Interestingness

* **To escape the myth of the objective, do things because they're interesting.**
* **Trust your gut feelings:** If you feel drawn to a particular direction, explore it, even if you don't have a clear objective.
* **Don't be afraid to deviate from your initial plans:** 
  * If you've shifted from computer programming to filmmaking, or from AI research to art, you might be on the right track.
  * **Stepping stones lead to unexpected and potentially valuable destinations.**
* **Great achievements often arise from chains of innovation that weren't initially planned.**

### Conclusion: Abandoning Objectives to Achieve Greatness

* **The prevailing culture often prioritizes objectives and chains exploration to them.**
* **However, evidence suggests that a treasure-hunting approach, guided by interestingness and novelty, is more effective for achieving breakthroughs.**
* **We should encourage divergence and allow people to pursue different paths, even if they seem unconventional or "wrong."**
* **Ultimately, to achieve our highest goals, we must be willing to abandon them temporarily and embrace the unpredictable journey of exploration.**
* **By following the scent of interestingness, we can unlock our potential and contribute to a future filled with unexpected and valuable discoveries.** 







## Chapter 10: Case Study 1 - Reinterpreting Natural Evolution

### Introduction

*   Every living organism, including humans, is a product of **natural evolution**. 
*   **Natural evolution** is an unguided process that has designed every organism on Earth.
*   Unlike most things, evolution continually creates new from old.
*   **Intelligent design** movement skeptics argue that the complexity of life suggests an intelligent creator.
*   Charles Darwin's theory of **natural selection** offers an alternative explanation: slightly imperfect self-copying can lead to the appearance of intelligent design.
*   **Natural selection:** Genes that enhance survival and reproduction are more likely to spread throughout a population.
*   Evolutionary biologists debate the importance of **natural selection** compared to other evolutionary forces (e.g., chance, history).
*   This chapter explores an alternative interpretation of **natural evolution** inspired by **non-objective search**.

### Common Interpretations of Evolution

#### Survival of the Fittest

*   "Survival of the fittest" is a popular catchphrase summarizing a core concept of evolution, though it wasn't coined by Darwin himself.
*   **Fitness**, in biology, refers to the average number of offspring an organism produces.
*   "Survival of the fittest" implies a **competitive search** for ever-more-fit organisms.
*   This perspective aligns with **objective thinking**, suggesting that evolution aims to achieve the objective of maximizing fitness.

#### Evolution as a Progressive Force

*   "Survival of the fittest" can lead to the view of evolution as a **bloody competition** where only the fittest survive.
*   Early evolutionists believed that evolution is **progressive**, striving for an **objective perfection** or an **über-organism**.
*   Some interpretations place humans as the pinnacle of evolution, suggesting objective superiority over other organisms.
*   However, a **human-centric view** is not supported by modern biology and leads to the **objective paradox**. 
    *   If evolution aimed directly at humans, the intermediate steps (e.g., flatworms) wouldn't resemble the final product, making the path implausible.

#### Survival and Reproduction as the Objective

*   Most scientists consider **survival and reproduction** as evolution's objective.
*   All living species inherently survive and reproduce; otherwise, they wouldn't exist.
*   **Natural selection** drives towards improved survival and reproduction, leading to the view that increasing fitness is evolution's objective.
*   This perspective fits the **objective paradigm** and aligns with common understanding.
*   However, this interpretation faces some challenges:
    *   **Survive and reproduce** was already achieved at the start of evolution with the first reproducing cell, contradicting the typical notion of an objective as something to be achieved.
    *   If the objective is to maximize fitness, bacteria (with high reproductive rates) would be considered more "successful" than humans, which doesn't align with our intuition about evolution's most interesting products.
    *   The diversity of life suggests an **accumulation of stepping stones**, similar to other **non-objective creative processes** (e.g., Picbreeder, human innovation).

### A Non-Objective Interpretation of Evolution

#### Survive and Reproduce as a Constraint

*   Instead of an objective, **survive and reproduce** can be viewed as a **constraint**.
*   Organisms that fail to reproduce are eliminated, while those that reproduce persist.
*   This perspective suggests that selection **restricts exploration** by pruning away parts of the search space.

#### Gentle Earth Thought Experiment

*   Imagine **Gentle Earth**: a hypothetical world without natural selection where every organism reproduces.
*   Even organisms that wouldn't survive on their own are helped to reproduce.
*   This removes the pressure of selection and allows for broader exploration of the search space.
*   On Gentle Earth, we would observe all the variety of life on Earth, plus many more organisms that wouldn't have survived under selection.
*   This thought experiment demonstrates that selection is not a creative force, but rather a **restrictive force** that limits exploration.

#### Evolution as a Treasure Hunter

*   Evolution accumulates **novelty and diversity**, similar to other **non-objective search processes**.
*   The **tree of life** branches outward, collecting new stepping stones as it goes.
*   **Diversity arises from avoiding competition** by founding new niches.
*   New niches often make founding newer niches possible, leading to a chain reaction of diversification.
*   Examples:
    *   An organism developing the ability to digest a new compound.
    *   The first land animal to fly escaping land-based predation.
    *   The invention of the computer enabling the ecosystem of software.
    *   The discovery of grass providing a platform for herbivores and their associated ecosystems.

#### Serendipity and Exaptation

*   **Serendipity** plays a significant role in evolution through **mutation**.
*   **Mutation:** Slight copying errors during reproduction that can lead to variations in offspring.
*   **Neutral genetic changes** (not affecting fitness) evolve through **genetic drift**.
*   **Exaptation:** A feature evolved for one function becomes useful in a different context.
*   Examples:
    *   Birds' feathers initially evolved for temperature regulation, later exapted for flight.
    *   Bones initially evolved for mineral storage, later exapted for structural support.
    *   The Picbreeder Car's wheels exapted from the eyes of the Alien Face.
    *   The vacuum tube exapted from early electrical investigations to enable computation.

### Abstraction and Interpretation

#### Evolution as a Minimal Criteria Search

*   **Abstraction** helps to understand natural processes by focusing on essential features and discarding unimportant details.
*   Viewing "survive and reproduce" as a **constraint** allows us to abstract away fitness differences between successful organisms.
*   The **single-cell bottleneck** highlights the diversity of methods nature has found to start from one cell and ultimately produce another.
*   Organisms can be seen as **Rube Goldberg machines**, performing complex processes to achieve the simple goal of reproduction.
*   Evolution can be viewed as a **minimal criteria search**, accumulating all the different ways to survive and reproduce.
*   As simple means of living are exhausted, the search explores more complex ones, driven by the "spill" of possibilities expanding in the search space.
*   **Minimal Criteria Novelty Search:** An algorithm inspired by this perspective, demonstrating the practical implications of the abstraction.

#### The Role of Competition

*   The **spilled-milk view** abstracts away competition entirely.
*   However, **competition** does play a role in natural evolution, though it may be less important for creativity than **diversity**.
*   **Local competition** (within niches) shapes organisms but encourages the founding of new niches to escape competition.
*   **Global competition** (across all organisms) would lead to convergence towards a single optimal organism.
*   **Evolution can be seen as a novelty-generating search with local competition**, balancing creativity and optimization.
*   **Novelty Search with Local Competition:** Another algorithm formalizing this abstraction, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse virtual creatures.

### The Fossil Record and Non-Objective Evolution

*   Evolution's successes result from its **mindless accumulation of stepping stones**, not from planning or intelligence.
*   The **tree of life** branches outward, reflecting the exploration of diverse niches without a specific objective.
*   The fossil record shows a constant branching and diversification, with the earliest life forms (bacteria) still persisting today.
*   The **Cambrian explosion** represents a period of rapid diversification, similar to the early stages of other creative processes.
*   The fossil record can be seen as a testament to the power of **non-objective search** and **serendipity**.

### Conclusion

*   Evolution's creativity arises from **escaping competition** to form new niches, not just from out-competing others.
*   **Diversity** and the **accumulation of stepping stones** are key to evolution's success.
*   Evolution is more like **open-ended brainstorming** than single-minded pursuit of a goal.
*   It's more about **exploration** than about **bloody competition**.
*   It's more like constructing novel **Rube Goldberg machines** than aspiring towards perfection.
*   Evolution is the ultimate **treasure hunter**, searching for nothing and finding everything as it explores the space of possible organisms.
*   It's the world's most prolific inventor, achieving its discoveries without pre-defined objectives.
*   This **non-objective perspective** offers a deeper understanding of evolution's creative power, challenging the myth of the objective.





## Chapter 11: Case Study 2 - Objectives and the Quest for AI

### Introduction: Science, Objectives, and the AI Community

*   **Science** is a search for knowledge, expanding possibilities and shaping the quality of our lives.
*   Scientific progress is influenced by how scientists communicate and interact, particularly within specialized communities called **disciplines**.
*   **Objectives**, while useful for measurement and encouragement, can introduce risks and unintended consequences in the scientific process.
*   The **Artificial Intelligence (AI) community** serves as a case study for examining the impact of objective-driven thinking on science due to its ambitious objective of creating highly intelligent machines.
*   The AI community's focus on this objective allows us to analyze the effects of objective thinking in a field where it's particularly prominent.
*   Understanding the role of objectives in AI research provides insights into how objectives affect decision-making in broader contexts, including other scientific fields and society.

### The AI Community: A Search for Algorithms

*   **Algorithms** are the core product of AI research.
    *   AI algorithms are designed to perform a wide range of tasks, from object recognition to game playing.
    *   The ultimate goal is a single algorithm capable of performing all human (and potentially more) tasks.
*   The field of AI can be viewed as a **search for algorithms**.
    *   Researchers work together to find new and improved algorithms.
    *   AI researchers also study how to search effectively, creating algorithms that automate search processes.
*   This creates a **meta-search**, where AI researchers search for algorithms that themselves search.
    *   This is analogous to searching for a curious puppy or hiring a skilled treasure hunter.
*   The connection between the AI community's meta-search and the insights from search algorithms is rarely discussed.
    *   While research analyzes search at the algorithm level, the AI community's own search for algorithms is less examined.
*   The question arises whether AI researchers, experts in search, are immune to the pitfalls of objective-driven search or if they are also susceptible to its deceptive nature.

### Gradients and Heuristics in AI Research

*   AI researchers use **heuristics** (rules of thumb) to guide their search for promising algorithms.
*   Two main heuristics dominate AI research:
    *   **Experimentalist Heuristic:** Judges algorithms based on their performance in benchmark tasks. Better performance indicates a more promising algorithm.
    *   **Theoretical Heuristic:** Favors algorithms that have desirable properties proven through mathematical guarantees.
*   These heuristics act as **gatekeepers** in the AI community, influencing which ideas are published and explored further.
*   The widespread acceptance of these heuristics shapes the direction of AI research and can lead to unintended consequences.

### Problems with the Experimentalist Heuristic

*   The experimentalist heuristic can lead to **deception**: Algorithms that appear promising based on performance may not lead to further advancements.
*   Focusing solely on performance can **stifle exploration** and prevent the discovery of novel algorithms that may not initially outperform existing ones.
*   **Example: Algorithm "Weird"**
    *   Weird is a novel algorithm that performs 5% worse than the established algorithm "OldReliable" in a standard benchmark.
    *   The experimentalist heuristic would favor rejecting Weird due to its lower performance.
    *   However, rejecting Weird prevents the exploration of its unique potential and the stepping stones it could open up.
*   The experimentalist heuristic can be likened to a **Chinese finger trap**, encouraging pulling harder (improving performance) when pushing (exploring novel, even if initially worse-performing, directions) might be necessary.
*   **Comparisons between algorithms can be misleading**: The reasons for finding an algorithm interesting may be unrelated to its performance compared to others.
    *   **Example: Humanoid Robot vs. Windup Toy Footrace**
        *   The windup toy wins easily, but this doesn't invalidate humanoid robot research.
        *   The comparison is irrelevant to the reasons for finding humanoid robots interesting.
*   The experimentalist heuristic may be suitable for **AI practitioners** who need to choose the best currently available algorithm for a specific task.
*   However, it is not ideal for **AI researchers** who are searching for future innovations and breakthroughs.
*   The experimentalist heuristic promotes an **objective-driven search** for perfect performance, which can be counterproductive in complex search spaces like the space of AI algorithms.

### Problems with the Theoretical Heuristic

*   The **theoretical heuristic** prioritizes algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees.
*   While guarantees provide certainty, the theoretical heuristic also has limitations.
*   **"Theoretical Heuristic" as a Paradox:**
    *   Heuristics are rules of thumb, while theorems offer absolute guarantees.
    *   The term "theoretical heuristic" refers to using theorems (theoretical) as a rule of thumb (heuristic) for judging an algorithm's potential as a stepping stone.
*   **Theorems about individual algorithms do not guarantee progress in the meta-search**:
    *   A theorem about algorithm OldReliable doesn't guarantee that future algorithms derived from it will inherit the same guarantees or be better.
    *   Focusing solely on algorithms with proven guarantees can restrict exploration and prevent the discovery of novel algorithms that may not initially have strong theoretical backing.
*   The theoretical heuristic assumes a specific structure of the search space, where more guarantees indicate closer proximity to AI objectives. 
    *   This assumption may not hold true in the vast and complex space of AI algorithms.
*   **Waiting for guarantees can hinder progress**:
    *   If algorithm Weird lacks guarantees but has the potential to lead to an interesting algorithm Weirder, waiting for Weird's guarantees delays or prevents the discovery of Weirder.
*   **Natural Evolution as a Counterexample**:
    *   Evolution produced human intelligence without proving any theorems.
    *   This demonstrates that guarantees are not a necessity for achieving complex outcomes.
*   The theoretical heuristic, like the experimentalist heuristic, fosters an **objective-driven search** within the space of AI algorithms, which may not be the most effective approach.

### The Iron Yardsticks and Their Consequences

*   The experimentalist and theoretical heuristics act as **iron yardsticks** wielded by gatekeepers in the AI community.
*   They heavily influence which ideas are shared and explored, limiting the search to algorithms that satisfy these heuristics.
*   These heuristics can hinder discovery and progress by:
    *   **Pruning away large parts of the search space**: Algorithms that don't meet the heuristics are ignored, preventing the exploration of their potential and the stepping stones beyond them.
    *   **Fostering a competitive environment**: Researchers focus on outperforming each other in benchmarks rather than collaborating to explore the space of algorithms.
    *   **Shifting the focus away from the substance of ideas**: Discussions revolve around performance and guarantees instead of exploring the intrinsic value and potential of new algorithms.

### Rethinking "Good" AI Algorithms and a Non-Objective Approach

*   **A "good" AI algorithm should be judged by its potential to inspire new algorithms and research directions**, not solely by its performance.
*   The AI community's obsession with performance improvements often leads to incremental advancements that lack significant insights.
*   **Algorithms should be evaluated as stepping stones**: The focus should be on whether an algorithm leads to new and interesting algorithms, regardless of its initial performance.
*   **Picbreeder as an Example**:
    *   The Picbreeder community successfully finds complex and meaningful images without relying on objective rules, expert panels, or performance comparisons.
    *   This demonstrates that communities can achieve significant results without rigid objective heuristics.
*   **The Role of Experts**:
    *   Expertise is crucial in evaluating new ideas, but objective heuristics should not replace expert judgment.
    *   Experts should be trusted to use their knowledge and intuition to assess the potential of new algorithms, even if they don't meet traditional performance or theoretical standards.
*   **The Journal of AI Discovery (JAID) Thought Experiment**:
    *   JAID is a hypothetical journal where reviewers are not allowed to consider experimental or theoretical results in their reviews.
    *   This forces reviewers to engage with the core ideas of an algorithm and judge its potential as a stepping stone based on its intrinsic value.
    *   The success or failure of JAID would reveal insights about the effectiveness of current heuristics and the role of expert judgment in AI research.

### Embracing Non-Objective Clues and the Importance of Open-mindedness

*   Relying solely on objective heuristics can hinder the discovery of truly groundbreaking ideas.
*   **Non-objective clues** can provide valuable insights into an algorithm's potential:
    *   Inspiration, elegance, potential to provoke creativity, thought-provoking construction, challenge to the status quo, novelty, analogy to nature, beauty, simplicity, and imagination.
*   **Experts should embrace open-mindedness and consider a broader range of factors when evaluating new ideas**:
    *   It's more challenging to deeply consider an idea's potential than to rely on simple heuristics.
    *   However, this effort is crucial for fostering innovation and progress in AI research.
*   **Science cannot rely on a fixed method for discovering great ideas**:
    *   The most significant advancements often come from unexpected sources and don't necessarily follow predictable paths.
    *   Open-mindedness and a willingness to explore unconventional ideas are essential for scientific progress.
*   **Conclusion**: 
    *   The AI community, and scientific communities in general, should move beyond rigid objective heuristics and embrace a more open-minded approach to evaluating new ideas, focusing on their potential to inspire further creativity and lead to unforeseen discoveries.  
    *   This shift requires trusting experts to use their judgment and considering a broader range of factors beyond performance and guarantees, ultimately fostering a more fruitful and innovative scientific landscape.
