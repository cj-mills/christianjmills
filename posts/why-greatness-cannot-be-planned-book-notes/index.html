<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-origin-of-the-book">The Origin of the Book</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>This book originated from a radical idea in <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> about algorithms achieving amazing things without explicit objectives.</p></li>
<li><p>Initial experiments yielded surprising results, prompting further exploration beyond AI.</p></li>
<li><p>The idea expanded to encompass broader implications for life, culture, society, innovation, achievement, biology, and more.</p></li>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>“If you don’t understand why I say that’s unusual, just consider how rare or bizarre it is for a computer algorithm to change how you think about life.”</strong></p>

<li><p>The book aims to communicate this novel insight and its broad implications to a wider audience.</p></li>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>“There is a story here—a story about an idea in AI and how it grew into something bigger—but there’s also a journey through a dizzying set of surprisingly broad implications for everything from personal dating, to the march of science, to the evolution of the human brain.”</strong></p>

<section id="introduction-a-world-driven-by-objectives" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-a-world-driven-by-objectives">Introduction: A World Driven by Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objectives</strong> are deeply ingrained in our culture, influencing everything from education and careers to personal goals and societal aspirations.</li>
<li>We rarely question the value of framing our pursuits with objectives.</li>
<li>Examples of objective-driven pursuits:
<ul>
<li>Education: Mastering subjects, achieving high test scores.</li>
<li>Careers: Job promotions, financial success.</li>
<li>Personal life: Finding a partner, improving physical appearance.</li>
<li>Societal goals: Low crime rates, economic growth, environmental sustainability.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The assumption is that any worthy accomplishment is best achieved by setting it as an objective and pursuing it with conviction.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-prevalence-of-objectives-in-various-fields" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-prevalence-of-objectives-in-various-fields">The Prevalence of Objectives in Various Fields</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Objectives are set through rigorous specifications, and progress is measured against these specifications.</li>
<li><strong>Science:</strong> Objectives are essential for securing funding and judging project success.</li>
<li><strong>Investing:</strong> Objectives focus on earnings and profits.</li>
<li><strong>Art and Design:</strong> Objectives involve conceiving a design and pursuing its realization.</li>
<li><strong>Evolutionary Biology:</strong> Objectives are framed in terms of survival and reproduction.</li>
<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> Algorithms are designed to work towards specific objectives.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-appeal-and-comfort-of-objectives" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-appeal-and-comfort-of-objectives">The Appeal and Comfort of Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Objectives offer a sense of order and predictability in an unpredictable world.</li>
<li>The belief that setting an objective creates possibility and that hard work leads to success provides a sense of optimism.</li>
</ul>

<section id="the-downside-of-objectives-limitations-and-costs" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-downside-of-objectives-limitations-and-costs">The Downside of Objectives: Limitations and Costs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limitations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Objectives can limit freedom and exploration.</li>
<li>They can stifle playful discovery and creativity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Costs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Objectives can lead to an overwhelming focus on measurements, assessments, and metrics.</li>
<li>They can become straitjackets, hindering our ability to explore new possibilities.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-paradox-of-ambitious-objectives" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-paradox-of-ambitious-objectives">The Paradox of Ambitious Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ambitious objectives</strong>, those whose achievement is uncertain, often become obstacles to their own fulfillment.</li>
<li>The stepping stones to achieving ambitious objectives are often unpredictable and counterintuitive.</li>
<li>Focusing solely on the objective can blind us to the necessary stepping stones.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="achievement-as-a-process-of-discovery" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="achievement-as-a-process-of-discovery">Achievement as a Process of Discovery</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Achievement</strong> can be viewed as a process of <strong>discovery</strong> within a vast <strong>search space</strong> of possibilities.</li>
<li><strong>Search space:</strong> The set of all possible things relevant to a particular domain (e.g., all possible images, inventions, musical genres).</li>
<li><strong>Stepping stones:</strong> Discoveries or innovations that pave the way for further progress within the search space.</li>
<li>Exploration of the search space and the discovery of stepping stones are crucial for reaching ambitious objectives.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-unpredictability-of-stepping-stones" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-unpredictability-of-stepping-stones">The Unpredictability of Stepping Stones</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stepping stones</strong> often bear little resemblance to the final objective.</li>
<li>Examples of unpredictable stepping stones:
<ul>
<li>Vacuum tubes (originally for electricity and radio) became crucial for early computers.</li>
<li>Engines (not initially intended for flight) were essential for airplanes.</li>
<li>Microwave technology (developed for radar) led to microwave ovens.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The structure of the search space is often <strong>unpredictable</strong> and <strong>deceptive</strong>.</li>
<li>Focusing solely on the objective can distract us from the unexpected stepping stones that are necessary for its achievement.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-power-of-no-objective-serendipity-and-discovery" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-power-of-no-objective-serendipity-and-discovery">The Power of No Objective: Serendipity and Discovery</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Great ideas</strong> often emerge without being explicitly pursued as objectives.</li>
<li>Examples of serendipitous discoveries:
<ul>
<li>Rock and roll music emerged from the fusion of various musical genres without a conscious objective to create it.</li>
<li>Elvis Presley’s unique sound was a result of unplanned experimentation rather than a deliberate objective.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Serendipity</strong> can play a significant role in achieving greatness.</li>

<li><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Anticipating the most fulfilling path is challenging in open-ended problems like career choice, making openness and flexibility crucial.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Value of Openness (Wiseman’s Experiment):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Subjects tasked with counting photographs in a newspaper.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The book challenges the common assumption that having an objective is always beneficial.</strong></li>
<li>The authors, AI researchers, initially embraced objectives like everyone else.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Picbreeder was designed as a website where users could “breed” pictures, similar to animal breeding.</strong></li>
<li>The idea was to allow users to create visually appealing images through an evolutionary process, even without artistic skills.</li>
<li><strong>Genetic Art:</strong> Pictures are assigned artificial “DNA,” allowing them to be bred like animals (first introduced by Richard Dawkins).</li>
<li>Users select “parent” pictures based on their preferences, influencing the characteristics of the next generation.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="picbreeders-mechanics-and-discoveries">Picbreeder’s Mechanics and Discoveries</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Picbreeder allows users to start from scratch (random blobs) or branch from existing images.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Starting from scratch:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Users select parent blobs from a randomly generated set.</li>
<li>Evolution progresses as users repeatedly choose parents for subsequent generations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Branching:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Users can continue evolving images published by other users.</li>
<li>This extends the evolutionary process beyond the typical attention span of a single user.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Despite starting from simple blobs, Picbreeder users evolved remarkably complex and compelling images.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stepping stones</strong> represent the necessary waypoints to reach an objective in a large, uncharted search space.</li>
<li>The challenge of search and discovery is that we usually don’t know the stepping stones to the objective at the outset.</li>
<li><strong>Ambitious objectives</strong> are particularly difficult because their solutions are multiple stepping stones away, making them hard to predict.</li>
<li>The human condition is akin to being marooned on a stepping stone with limited foresight.</li>

</section>
<section id="the-deception-of-objective-functions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-deception-of-objective-functions">The Deception of Objective Functions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective functions</strong> (measures of progress) are used to track progress towards objectives.</li>
<li>The assumption that improving objective function scores guarantees progress towards the objective is often <strong>wrong</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Deception</strong> occurs when the objective function is a false compass, meaning it may not register progress even when moving closer to the objective.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> The Chinese finger trap, where moving away from freedom (pushing inward) is the stepping stone to achieving freedom.</li>
<li>Ambitious problems are likely to involve multiple deceptive stepping stones.</li>
<li><strong>Deception is universal</strong> in complex problems because the stepping stones to solve them are not obvious.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Chess moves that seem promising but lead to trouble, vacuum tubes leading to computers, ragtime leading to rock and roll.</li>

<li><strong>Deceptive objective:</strong> Focusing on the computer diverts attention from pursuing the necessary prerequisites.</li>
<li><strong>Hypothesis about invention:</strong> Almost no prerequisite to any major invention was invented with that invention in mind.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> The Wright brothers’ invention of the airplane relied on pre-existing innovations like the internal combustion engine, which was not invented with flight in mind.</li>
<li><strong>The chain of innovation:</strong> Each link (e.g., induction coil, internal combustion engine, airplane) was not invented with the next link in mind.</li>
<li><strong>Great invention:</strong> Recognizing that existing stepping stones, laid by predecessors with unrelated ambitions, can be combined and enhanced to reach a new stepping stone.</li>

<li><strong>Novelty as a Stepping Stone Detector:</strong> Novel discoveries are potential stepping stones to further novelties.</li>
<li><strong>Interestingness:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Interesting ideas open up new possibilities.</li>
<li><strong>Philosophical Significance:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Alfred Whitehead: “It is more important that a proposition be interesting than it be true.”</li>
<li>W.T. Stace: “The criticism that interestingness is a trivial end proceeds from a scale of values thus perverted and turned upside down.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Compounding Novelty:</strong> Continually seeking novelty creates an endless chain of stepping stones, branching out into an open future.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Picbreeder, natural evolution, and human innovation illustrate this <strong>ratcheting process</strong> of building upon stepping stones without a specific end goal.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fear of Aimlessness:</strong> Searching for novelty might seem unanchored and random.</li>
<li><strong>Information in Novelty:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Novelty provides information about how something is different from the past.</li>
<li>This information is arguably more plentiful and reliable than information provided by an objective (which can be deceptive).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Human Sensitivity to Novelty:</strong> We are naturally drawn to explore novel paths and ideas, even without knowing where they might lead.

<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional View:</strong> Serendipity is seen as accidental, like a mad scientist stumbling upon a breakthrough.</li>
<li><strong>Reality:</strong> Most serendipitous discoveries are made by intelligent, educated, and accomplished individuals who have a <strong>strong intuition for what is interesting</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Isaac Newton: Observing an apple falling led to the discovery of the universal law of gravitation.</li>
<li>Louis Pasteur: Made accidental discoveries like chiral molecules and bacterial vaccines.</li>
<li>Archimedes: Eureka moment in the bathtub led to understanding displacement and volume.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Prepared Minds:</strong>
<ul>
<li>These individuals were able to recognize the significance of their observations and connect them to broader concepts.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Algorithms:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Traditional View: Recipes for solving specific problems.</li>
<li>Broader Definition: A way of clearly describing a process, with or without an objective.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Novelty Search Algorithm:</strong> Formalizes the process of searching for novelty as a computer program.</li>
<li><strong>Domain:</strong> The specific area or category within which the algorithm searches for novelty (e.g., art, music, robot behaviors).</li>
<li><strong>Robot Behavior Example:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional Approach (Objective-Driven):</strong> A robot learns to navigate a hallway to reach an open door by incrementally improving its ability to move closer to the door.</li>
<li><strong>Novelty Search Approach:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The robot seeks novel behaviors, initially crashing into walls in various ways.</li>
<li>By exhausting simple behaviors, it eventually learns to avoid walls and navigate the hallway to find further novelties, eventually reaching the door even though it wasn’t an objective.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional Objective-Driven Search:</strong> Expects an order from bad to good behavior, with incremental improvements towards the objective.</li>
<li><strong>Problem with Bad-to-Good Ordering:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deceptive Problems:</strong> Like the Chinese finger trap, progress may require temporarily moving away from the objective (from bad to worse before getting better).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Novelty Search Ordering:</strong> From simple to complex behaviors.
<ul>
<li><strong>Novelty is Context-Dependent:</strong> What is considered novel changes over time as new behaviors are discovered.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity to Complexity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Initially, simple behaviors (requiring little knowledge of the world) are novel.</li>
<li>To continue finding novelty, the search must learn about the world and produce increasingly complex behaviors.</li>

<li><strong>Information Accumulation:</strong> Both novelty search and other non-objective searches (like natural evolution) accumulate information about the world as they progress from simple to complex.</li>
<li><strong>Natural Evolution:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Increasing complexity is driven by the need to find new niches and species as simple options are exhausted.</li>
<li>Organisms reflect aspects of the world in their structure and behavior (e.g., eyes reflect light, lungs reflect oxygen).</li>
<li>Evolution can be seen as a process of accumulating information about the universe.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Picbreeder:</strong> Reflects aspects of the human world (its environment) by discovering familiar themes like faces, butterflies, and castles.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Argument:</strong> Some argue that novelty itself is an objective.</li>
<li><strong>Problems with this View:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Achieving Novelty is Different from Achieving an Objective:</strong> With novelty, the specific outcome is not the goal.</li>
<li><strong>Novelty is Fleeting:</strong> What is novel quickly becomes less novel, unlike achieving a fixed objective.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Fulfillments:</strong> A novelty-driven search might achieve “novelty” many times before reaching a specific outcome, making it unclear how that outcome fulfills the “objective”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Distinction is Important:</strong> Using the word “objective” for both traditional goals and novelty muddles the important differences between them.</li>
<li><strong>Similarities to “Survive and Reproduce”:</strong> Both are constraints rather than objectives, can be satisfied from the beginning, and lead to discoveries that weren’t initially intended.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Novelty search as a tool:</strong> While novelty search can be a useful tool, it’s not a universal solution. It may not work for all problems, particularly those involving vast, complex search spaces (e.g., an endless maze).</li>
<li><strong>Myth of the objective:</strong> Despite novelty search’s successes in certain scenarios, the belief in the necessity of objectives persists.</li>
<li><strong>Diversity as a compromise:</strong> One argument is that objectives are still valuable but require a <strong>diversity of ideas</strong> during the search process to avoid being misled by deceptive paths.</li>
<li><strong>Horse racing analogy:</strong> This perspective is compared to betting on multiple horses in a race to increase the chances of winning, suggesting that maintaining a variety of alternatives is beneficial even when pursuing an objective.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid approach:</strong> This leads to the idea of combining objective-driven search with novelty search, using the objective for guidance and novelty to prevent deception.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-deception-of-objectives-and-the-futility-of-search">The Deception of Objectives and the Futility of Search</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ambitious objectives and deception:</strong> The chapter argues that the more ambitious the objective, the more deceptive it becomes.</li>
<li><strong>False compass analogy:</strong> A deceptive objective acts like a compass pointing in the wrong direction, rendering open-mindedness ineffective.</li>
<li><strong>Maze-navigating robot example:</strong> Even in a simple maze, the objective of reaching the end can be deceptive due to walls that attract the robot based on proximity but hinder actual progress.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations of objectives with novelty:</strong> Combining novelty with objectives doesn’t fully solve the deception problem in ambitious situations.</li>
<li><strong>Five thousand year old computer example:</strong> The objective of building a computer five thousand years ago would have been deeply deceptive, as the necessary stepping stones (e.g., vacuum tubes) were unimaginable at the time.</li>
<li><strong>Futility at the heart of search:</strong> The chapter concludes that no single search approach can guarantee reaching a specific objective, especially for highly ambitious goals.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations of objective-driven search:</strong> The fact that novelty search outperforms objective-driven search in some simple problems raises concerns about the latter’s effectiveness in more complex scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>No Free Lunch Theorem:</strong> This theorem supports the idea that there’s no universally best search algorithm, as improving performance on one set of problems can negatively impact performance on others.</li>
<li><strong>Black box optimization:</strong> This field in machine learning also acknowledges that general rules or heuristics can be misleading in specific circumstances.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Finding the unexpected:</strong> Despite the limitations of search, the chapter argues that we can reliably find amazing things, even if we can’t predefine them.</li>
<li><strong>Great discoveries as undefined:</strong> This idea is based on the success of Picbreeder, natural evolution, and human innovation, all of which involve processes without predefined objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Non-objective search as a treasure hunter:</strong> It’s presented as a powerful tool for finding unexpected treasures while exploring the search space.</li>
<li><strong>Picbreeder Car example:</strong> The Picbreeder Car, a surprising and complex image, was discovered without anyone explicitly searching for it, demonstrating the potential of non-objective search.</li>
<li><strong>The paradox of trying vs.&nbsp;not trying:</strong> The chapter highlights the irony that actively trying to achieve a specific objective can hinder progress, while exploring without a fixed goal can lead to unexpected breakthroughs.</li>
<li><strong>Treasure hunter’s approach:</strong> The treasure hunter collects as many stepping stones as possible, recognizing that any one of them could lead to something valuable, even if the ultimate destination is unknown.</li>
<li><strong>Collective exploration:</strong> The chapter emphasizes the importance of diverse individuals with different interests contributing to the exploration of the search space, rather than relying on a single objective or individual.</li>
<li><strong>The inevitability of the future:</strong> While the future may not unfold as planned, the continuous exploration of diverse individuals ensures that unexpected discoveries and advancements will emerge.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Novelty search as a model:</strong> The chapter suggests that novelty search and Picbreeder demonstrate the feasibility of building systems based on non-objective principles.</li>
<li><strong>Human feedback and collaboration:</strong> Human feedback, as seen in Picbreeder, can play a crucial role in guiding non-objective search and capitalizing on the diverse tastes and insights of individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Internet as a platform for treasure hunting:</strong> The internet provides an ideal platform for organizing and facilitating collaborative treasure hunting through interconnected systems.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive catalog example:</strong> The chapter presents the concept of an interactive catalog (e.g., for furniture) where users can explore and “breed” new designs based on existing ones.</li>
<li><strong>Customer-driven design:</strong> This system allows customers to become active participants in the design process, discovering unique and personalized products that wouldn’t have been conceived through traditional methods.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative stepping stone collection:</strong> The catalog evolves into a repository of user-generated designs, each potentially serving as a stepping stone for further exploration and innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Trusting the non-objective catalog:</strong> The chapter raises the question of whether users would trust a catalog where designs are generated through a collaborative, non-objective process rather than by expert designers.</li>
<li><strong>The role of experts:</strong> While acknowledging the importance of expert designers, the chapter suggests that non-objective systems can uncover hidden treasures that experts might miss due to their focus on specific objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Potential of non-objective systems:</strong> The chapter argues that non-objective systems, like the interactive catalog, can lead to the creation of innovative concepts that would otherwise remain undiscovered.</li>

<li><strong>Embracing the treasure hunter:</strong> Instead, we should embrace the treasure hunter approach, exploring the search space without a fixed objective and collecting stepping stones that may lead to unexpected and valuable discoveries.</li>
<li><strong>Natural evolution, human innovation, Picbreeder, and novelty search as examples:</strong> These examples demonstrate the power and success of non-objective processes in generating innovation and progress.</li>
<li><strong>Liberation from objectives:</strong> Freeing ourselves from the grip of objectives can lead to a new perspective on the world and open up new possibilities for innovation and discovery.</li>
<li><strong>Implications for society:</strong> The next chapters will explore the implications of this non-objective perspective for how we organize and operate our society.</li>
<li><strong>The future of innovation:</strong> The chapter concludes with an optimistic outlook on the future of innovation, suggesting that it will be driven by the collective exploration of diverse individuals without a unified objective, leading to unexpected and exciting discoveries.</li>

<li>Instead of prioritizing assessment, we can reframe education as a <strong>treasure hunt</strong> for the best teaching approaches.</li>
<li>This shift requires:
<ul>
<li>Reducing the emphasis on standardized tests.</li>
<li>Empowering teachers to utilize their creativity and intuition.</li>
<li>Encouraging experimentation and the exploration of diverse methods.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Finland’s education system, which grants greater autonomy to teachers and doesn’t impose standardized tests, serves as an example of a non-objective approach.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-the-allure-of-exploration-and-the-myth-of-the-objective">Introduction: The Allure of Exploration and the Myth of the Objective</h3>
<ul>
<li>The chapter opens with captivating stories of early explorers like Magellan, Verrazzano, and Scott who braved the unknown, highlighting the inherent risks and potential rewards of exploration.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation</strong>, particularly in science, is presented as a modern form of exploration with the power to reshape society.</li>
<li>The chapter aims to explore how the <strong>myth of the objective</strong> hinders innovation in various fields, including science, business, and art.</li>
<li>The rapid pace of scientific progress is emphasized through examples like George Washington’s letter-writing predicament and the evolution of communication from handwritten letters to real-time video chats.</li>
<li>The chapter acknowledges that scientific exploration may not be as visually thrilling as geographical expeditions, but the discoveries it yields can be equally transformative, potentially leading to advancements like a universal cure for cancer or cheap energy through nuclear fusion.</li>
<li>The chapter establishes that the pursuit of scientific innovation is often constrained by the <strong>myth of the objective</strong>, particularly in funding decisions, which tend to prioritize projects with clear objectives and predictable outcomes.</li>

<section id="the-problem-with-consensus-in-science-funding" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem-with-consensus-in-science-funding">The Problem with Consensus in Science Funding</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Science funding</strong> is identified as a key area where the myth of the objective plays a significant role.</li>
<li>Government funding agencies like the NSF and ESF rely on <strong>peer review</strong> to evaluate grant proposals, favoring projects that achieve consensus among expert reviewers.</li>
<li>The chapter argues that <strong>consensus can be detrimental to innovation</strong> because it discourages exploration of diverse and potentially groundbreaking ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Picbreeder</strong> is used as an analogy to illustrate how consensus can stifle creativity.
<ul>
<li>Picbreeder’s success in generating novel images stems from the fact that users are free to explore diverse paths without needing to agree on which images are “better.”</li>
<li>If a panel of experts were to vote on the next image in Picbreeder, the number of explored paths would be severely limited.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The chapter suggests that <strong>rewarding disagreement</strong> instead of consensus might be a more effective strategy for promoting innovation.
<ul>
<li>Unanimous agreement on a project might indicate that it merely echoes the status quo.</li>
<li><strong>Interesting ideas are more likely to split expert opinions</strong> because they often challenge existing paradigms and explore uncharted territory.</li>
<li>Examples like Darwin’s theory of evolution and Thomas Kuhn’s concept of paradigm shifts are cited to demonstrate how groundbreaking ideas initially faced resistance from the scientific community.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The chapter clarifies that it’s not advocating for funding all projects with disagreement, but rather suggesting that some resources should be allocated to support <strong>interesting and potentially transformative research</strong>, even if it lacks consensus.</li>
<li>The emphasis on consensus in science funding is linked to <strong>objective thinking</strong>, which prioritizes reaching a predetermined destination over exploring diverse and potentially serendipitous paths.</li>
<li>The chapter concludes that <strong>science needs to embrace the role of a treasure hunter and a stepping stone collector</strong>, allowing researchers to explore diverse and unpredictable paths rather than being solely focused on achieving predefined objectives.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-illusion-of-predictable-scientific-progress-and-impact">The Illusion of Predictable Scientific Progress and Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>The myth of the objective leads to the assumption that scientific progress is predictable and that the stepping stones to important discoveries can be laid out in an orderly fashion.</li>
<li>The chapter challenges this assumption by highlighting the <strong>serendipitous nature of many scientific breakthroughs</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Grand, objective-driven projects</strong> aimed at solving specific problems are discussed, with examples like Japan’s Fifth Generation Computer Systems project and the War on Cancer.
<ul>
<li>These projects, despite significant funding and targeted research, often fail to achieve their stated objectives or produce unexpected outcomes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The chapter acknowledges that some ambitious projects, like the space race, can be successful, but emphasizes that such success often relies on <strong>pre-existing stepping stones</strong> developed outside the scope of the project itself.</li>
<li>The chapter argues that <strong>predicting the impact of scientific research is challenging</strong> and that focusing solely on projects with perceived high impact can be short-sighted.
<ul>
<li>Many important discoveries are unexpected and may not seem immediately impactful.</li>
<li><strong>Interesting research, even if not deemed immediately important, can lead to unanticipated breakthroughs in the future</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Picbreeder and novelty search</strong> are again used as analogies to illustrate how systems can produce remarkable results even when individual components are not evaluated based on their progress towards a specific objective.</li>
<li>The chapter suggests that funding agencies should consider supporting <strong>interesting and potentially transformative research</strong>, even if its immediate impact is unclear.</li>
<li>Examples from pure mathematics, such as group theory and public-key cryptography, are provided to demonstrate how seemingly “useless” research can later have significant practical applications.</li>
<li>The chapter cautions against <strong>funding science based solely on its alignment with specific national interests or short-term economic goals</strong>.
<ul>
<li>This approach can stifle basic research and limit the potential for serendipitous discoveries.</li>
<li>The chapter criticizes policies that prioritize research with immediate economic benefits over curiosity-driven exploration.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The chapter concludes that while scientific progress is possible, it is not always predictable, and that embracing <strong>curiosity-driven research</strong> and exploring diverse paths is essential for achieving transformative breakthroughs.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="embracing-risk-and-uncertainty-in-scientific-funding">Embracing Risk and Uncertainty in Scientific Funding</h3>
<ul>
<li>The chapter argues that <strong>objectives can hinder scientific progress by promoting risk aversion</strong>.</li>
<li>Funding agencies often require researchers to clearly define objectives and demonstrate a high likelihood of success, which can discourage exploration of risky but potentially groundbreaking ideas.</li>
<li>The chapter suggests that <strong>some research should be pursued simply because it’s interesting</strong>, even if the potential outcomes are uncertain.</li>
<li>The chapter proposes funding researchers with a track record of interesting discoveries without requiring them to specify detailed objectives, similar to the MacArthur Fellowships.</li>
<li>The chapter acknowledges that <strong>risk is inherent in scientific research</strong>, and that embracing uncertainty is necessary for achieving significant progress.</li>
<li>The chapter draws a parallel between <strong>business investing and scientific funding</strong>.
<ul>
<li>In business, investors tend to favor projects with <strong>realistic, short-term objectives</strong> that are achievable within a few stepping stones.</li>
<li><strong>Innovative business ideas</strong> often reveal nearby stepping stones that were previously unseen, but investors typically require a clear understanding of these stepping stones before providing funding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The example of Tesla Motors is used to illustrate how <strong>innovation in business can arise from unexpected combinations of existing technologies</strong>.</li>
<li>The chapter concludes that both scientists and businesspeople should focus on exploring <strong>nearby stepping stones</strong> rather than setting overly ambitious long-term objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation often arises from unexpected discoveries</strong> made while exploring seemingly unrelated paths.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-role-of-objectives-in-art-and-design">The Role of Objectives in Art and Design</h3>
<ul>
<li>The chapter suggests that <strong>artists and designers</strong> have a more intuitive understanding of the myth of the objective compared to scientists or businesspeople.</li>
<li><strong>Art is often driven by creative exploration</strong> rather than the pursuit of specific objectives.</li>
<li>The chapter acknowledges that <strong>objectives can play a role in design</strong>, particularly when functionality and safety are concerned.
<ul>
<li>These objectives are compared to the <strong>constraints faced by organisms in natural evolution</strong>, which must survive and reproduce but can do so in a vast array of ways.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The chapter argues that <strong>innovation in art and design often involves finding new ways to work within existing constraints</strong>.</li>
<li>Examples from art history, such as the evolution from Impressionism to Expressionism to Surrealism, are used to demonstrate how <strong>new artistic movements often arise unexpectedly</strong> from the exploration of previous styles.</li>
<li>The chapter highlights that <strong>individual artists may also struggle with the pressure to justify their work in terms of objectives</strong>.
<ul>
<li>The example of an art student who created sculptures by beating metal with an axe and rusting them is used to illustrate this point.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The chapter concludes that <strong>art is valuable for its own sake</strong> and for the potential it has to inspire future creative explorations.</li>

<li>The chapter emphasizes that <strong>non-objective thinking is not a universal solution</strong>, but rather an alternative approach that can lead to greater creativity and innovation in certain contexts.</li>
<li><strong>Escaping the myth of the objective</strong> can be challenging but potentially rewarding, as it allows for exploration of diverse and unpredictable paths.</li>
<li>The chapter encourages readers to <strong>consider the potential of non-objective thinking</strong> in their own lives and endeavors.</li>
<li>The chapter concludes with a call to <strong>embrace the uncertainty and freedom</strong> that comes with abandoning the rigid pursuit of predefined objectives.</li>
<li>The chapter suggests that <strong>non-objective thinking can help us move forward</strong> and achieve breakthroughs in various fields, acting as a stepping stone towards a brighter future.</li>

<ul>
<li>The book proposes a <strong>paradoxical approach</strong>: We can achieve ambitious outcomes by <em>not</em> directly aiming for them.</li>
<li><strong>Evolution</strong> serves as a prime example:
<ul>
<li>It produced complex organisms without a predetermined objective.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The alternative to objective-driven pursuit is to become a treasure hunter.</strong>
<ul>
<li>This involves exploring the unknown and seeking out valuable discoveries, even if they weren’t the initial target.</li>
<li><strong>Stepping stones</strong> are the key: One good idea leads to another, creating a chain of discoveries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Clues</strong> guide the treasure hunter, but these clues are not about the objective itself. Instead, they indicate the potential for something worthwhile nearby.
<ul>
<li><strong>Novelty</strong> can be a clue: Something new may lead to something even newer.
<ul>
<li>Novelty search algorithms in robotics demonstrate this principle: Robots discover complex behaviors by pursuing novelty.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Interestingness</strong> is another crucial clue, particularly for humans:
<ul>
<li>We are drawn to things that pique our interest, whether it’s music, writing, or exploration.</li>
<li>Interestingness is subjective and varies among individuals, but this diversity benefits society.</li>

<li>The book provides numerous examples where ignoring objectives led to superior results compared to pursuing them.</li>
<li><strong>Justification for following interestingness:</strong>

<li>True innovators don’t focus on distant, grandiose visions. Instead, they concentrate on the <strong>edge of what’s currently possible</strong>.</li>
<li>They ask: “Where can we get from here?” rather than “How can we get there?”</li>
<li>They build upon existing capabilities and knowledge, taking small but significant steps forward.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Every living organism, including humans, is a product of <strong>natural evolution</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Natural evolution</strong> is an unguided process that has designed every organism on Earth.</li>
<li>Unlike most things, evolution continually creates new from old.</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent design</strong> movement skeptics argue that the complexity of life suggests an intelligent creator.</li>
<li>Charles Darwin’s theory of <strong>natural selection</strong> offers an alternative explanation: slightly imperfect self-copying can lead to the appearance of intelligent design.</li>
<li><strong>Natural selection:</strong> Genes that enhance survival and reproduction are more likely to spread throughout a population.</li>
<li>Evolutionary biologists debate the importance of <strong>natural selection</strong> compared to other evolutionary forces (e.g., chance, history).</li>

<ul>
<li>“Survival of the fittest” is a popular catchphrase summarizing a core concept of evolution, though it wasn’t coined by Darwin himself.</li>
<li><strong>Fitness</strong>, in biology, refers to the average number of offspring an organism produces.</li>
<li>“Survival of the fittest” implies a <strong>competitive search</strong> for ever-more-fit organisms.</li>
<li>This perspective aligns with <strong>objective thinking</strong>, suggesting that evolution aims to achieve the objective of maximizing fitness.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evolution-as-a-progressive-force">Evolution as a Progressive Force</h4>
<ul>
<li>“Survival of the fittest” can lead to the view of evolution as a <strong>bloody competition</strong> where only the fittest survive.</li>
<li>Early evolutionists believed that evolution is <strong>progressive</strong>, striving for an <strong>objective perfection</strong> or an <strong>über-organism</strong>.</li>
<li>Some interpretations place humans as the pinnacle of evolution, suggesting objective superiority over other organisms.</li>
<li>However, a <strong>human-centric view</strong> is not supported by modern biology and leads to the <strong>objective paradox</strong>.
<ul>
<li>If evolution aimed directly at humans, the intermediate steps (e.g., flatworms) wouldn’t resemble the final product, making the path implausible.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="survival-and-reproduction-as-the-objective">Survival and Reproduction as the Objective</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most scientists consider <strong>survival and reproduction</strong> as evolution’s objective.</li>
<li>All living species inherently survive and reproduce; otherwise, they wouldn’t exist.</li>
<li><strong>Natural selection</strong> drives towards improved survival and reproduction, leading to the view that increasing fitness is evolution’s objective.</li>
<li>This perspective fits the <strong>objective paradigm</strong> and aligns with common understanding.</li>
<li>However, this interpretation faces some challenges:
<ul>
<li><strong>Survive and reproduce</strong> was already achieved at the start of evolution with the first reproducing cell, contradicting the typical notion of an objective as something to be achieved.</li>
<li>If the objective is to maximize fitness, bacteria (with high reproductive rates) would be considered more “successful” than humans, which doesn’t align with our intuition about evolution’s most interesting products.</li>
<li>The diversity of life suggests an <strong>accumulation of stepping stones</strong>, similar to other <strong>non-objective creative processes</strong> (e.g., Picbreeder, human innovation).</li>

<li><strong>Abstraction</strong> helps to understand natural processes by focusing on essential features and discarding unimportant details.</li>
<li>Viewing “survive and reproduce” as a <strong>constraint</strong> allows us to abstract away fitness differences between successful organisms.</li>
<li>The <strong>single-cell bottleneck</strong> highlights the diversity of methods nature has found to start from one cell and ultimately produce another.</li>
<li>Organisms can be seen as <strong>Rube Goldberg machines</strong>, performing complex processes to achieve the simple goal of reproduction.</li>
<li>Evolution can be viewed as a <strong>minimal criteria search</strong>, accumulating all the different ways to survive and reproduce.</li>
<li>As simple means of living are exhausted, the search explores more complex ones, driven by the “spill” of possibilities expanding in the search space.</li>
<li><strong>Minimal Criteria Novelty Search:</strong> An algorithm inspired by this perspective, demonstrating the practical implications of the abstraction.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-role-of-competition">The Role of Competition</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>spilled-milk view</strong> abstracts away competition entirely.</li>
<li>However, <strong>competition</strong> does play a role in natural evolution, though it may be less important for creativity than <strong>diversity</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Local competition</strong> (within niches) shapes organisms but encourages the founding of new niches to escape competition.</li>
<li><strong>Global competition</strong> (across all organisms) would lead to convergence towards a single optimal organism.</li>
<li><strong>Evolution can be seen as a novelty-generating search with local competition</strong>, balancing creativity and optimization.</li>
<li><strong>Novelty Search with Local Competition:</strong> Another algorithm formalizing this abstraction, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse virtual creatures.</li>

<ul>
<li>Evolution’s successes result from its <strong>mindless accumulation of stepping stones</strong>, not from planning or intelligence.</li>
<li>The <strong>tree of life</strong> branches outward, reflecting the exploration of diverse niches without a specific objective.</li>
<li>The fossil record shows a constant branching and diversification, with the earliest life forms (bacteria) still persisting today.</li>
<li>The <strong>Cambrian explosion</strong> represents a period of rapid diversification, similar to the early stages of other creative processes.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-2">Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Evolution’s creativity arises from <strong>escaping competition</strong> to form new niches, not just from out-competing others.</li>
<li><strong>Diversity</strong> and the <strong>accumulation of stepping stones</strong> are key to evolution’s success.</li>
<li>Evolution is more like <strong>open-ended brainstorming</strong> than single-minded pursuit of a goal.</li>
<li>It’s more about <strong>exploration</strong> than about <strong>bloody competition</strong>.</li>
<li>It’s more like constructing novel <strong>Rube Goldberg machines</strong> than aspiring towards perfection.</li>
<li>Evolution is the ultimate <strong>treasure hunter</strong>, searching for nothing and finding everything as it explores the space of possible organisms.</li>
<li>It’s the world’s most prolific inventor, achieving its discoveries without pre-defined objectives.</li>
<li>This <strong>non-objective perspective</strong> offers a deeper understanding of evolution’s creative power, challenging the myth of the objective.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Science</strong> is a search for knowledge, expanding possibilities and shaping the quality of our lives.</li>
<li>Scientific progress is influenced by how scientists communicate and interact, particularly within specialized communities called <strong>disciplines</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Objectives</strong>, while useful for measurement and encouragement, can introduce risks and unintended consequences in the scientific process.</li>
<li>The <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) community</strong> serves as a case study for examining the impact of objective-driven thinking on science due to its ambitious objective of creating highly intelligent machines.</li>
<li>The AI community’s focus on this objective allows us to analyze the effects of objective thinking in a field where it’s particularly prominent.</li>
<li>Understanding the role of objectives in AI research provides insights into how objectives affect decision-making in broader contexts, including other scientific fields and society.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-ai-community-a-search-for-algorithms">The AI Community: A Search for Algorithms</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Algorithms</strong> are the core product of AI research.
<ul>
<li>AI algorithms are designed to perform a wide range of tasks, from object recognition to game playing.</li>
<li>The ultimate goal is a single algorithm capable of performing all human (and potentially more) tasks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The field of AI can be viewed as a <strong>search for algorithms</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Researchers work together to find new and improved algorithms.</li>
<li>AI researchers also study how to search effectively, creating algorithms that automate search processes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This creates a <strong>meta-search</strong>, where AI researchers search for algorithms that themselves search.
<ul>
<li>This is analogous to searching for a curious puppy or hiring a skilled treasure hunter.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The connection between the AI community’s meta-search and the insights from search algorithms is rarely discussed.
<ul>
<li>While research analyzes search at the algorithm level, the AI community’s own search for algorithms is less examined.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The question arises whether AI researchers, experts in search, are immune to the pitfalls of objective-driven search or if they are also susceptible to its deceptive nature.</li>

<section id="gradients-and-heuristics-in-ai-research" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gradients-and-heuristics-in-ai-research">Gradients and Heuristics in AI Research</h3>
<ul>
<li>AI researchers use <strong>heuristics</strong> (rules of thumb) to guide their search for promising algorithms.</li>
<li>Two main heuristics dominate AI research:
<ul>
<li><strong>Experimentalist Heuristic:</strong> Judges algorithms based on their performance in benchmark tasks. Better performance indicates a more promising algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Theoretical Heuristic:</strong> Favors algorithms that have desirable properties proven through mathematical guarantees.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These heuristics act as <strong>gatekeepers</strong> in the AI community, influencing which ideas are published and explored further.</li>
<li>The widespread acceptance of these heuristics shapes the direction of AI research and can lead to unintended consequences.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="problems-with-the-experimentalist-heuristic" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="problems-with-the-experimentalist-heuristic">Problems with the Experimentalist Heuristic</h3>
<ul>
<li>The experimentalist heuristic can lead to <strong>deception</strong>: Algorithms that appear promising based on performance may not lead to further advancements.</li>
<li>Focusing solely on performance can <strong>stifle exploration</strong> and prevent the discovery of novel algorithms that may not initially outperform existing ones.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Algorithm “Weird”</strong>
<ul>
<li>Weird is a novel algorithm that performs 5% worse than the established algorithm “OldReliable” in a standard benchmark.</li>
<li>The experimentalist heuristic would favor rejecting Weird due to its lower performance.</li>
<li>However, rejecting Weird prevents the exploration of its unique potential and the stepping stones it could open up.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The experimentalist heuristic can be likened to a <strong>Chinese finger trap</strong>, encouraging pulling harder (improving performance) when pushing (exploring novel, even if initially worse-performing, directions) might be necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Comparisons between algorithms can be misleading</strong>: The reasons for finding an algorithm interesting may be unrelated to its performance compared to others.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example: Humanoid Robot vs.&nbsp;Windup Toy Footrace</strong>
<ul>
<li>The windup toy wins easily, but this doesn’t invalidate humanoid robot research.</li>
<li>The comparison is irrelevant to the reasons for finding humanoid robots interesting.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The experimentalist heuristic may be suitable for <strong>AI practitioners</strong> who need to choose the best currently available algorithm for a specific task.</li>
<li>However, it is not ideal for <strong>AI researchers</strong> who are searching for future innovations and breakthroughs.</li>
<li>The experimentalist heuristic promotes an <strong>objective-driven search</strong> for perfect performance, which can be counterproductive in complex search spaces like the space of AI algorithms.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="problems-with-the-theoretical-heuristic" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="problems-with-the-theoretical-heuristic">Problems with the Theoretical Heuristic</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>theoretical heuristic</strong> prioritizes algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees.</li>
<li>While guarantees provide certainty, the theoretical heuristic also has limitations.</li>
<li><strong>“Theoretical Heuristic” as a Paradox:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Heuristics are rules of thumb, while theorems offer absolute guarantees.</li>
<li>The term “theoretical heuristic” refers to using theorems (theoretical) as a rule of thumb (heuristic) for judging an algorithm’s potential as a stepping stone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Theorems about individual algorithms do not guarantee progress in the meta-search</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A theorem about algorithm OldReliable doesn’t guarantee that future algorithms derived from it will inherit the same guarantees or be better.</li>
<li>Focusing solely on algorithms with proven guarantees can restrict exploration and prevent the discovery of novel algorithms that may not initially have strong theoretical backing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The theoretical heuristic assumes a specific structure of the search space, where more guarantees indicate closer proximity to AI objectives.
<ul>
<li>This assumption may not hold true in the vast and complex space of AI algorithms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Waiting for guarantees can hinder progress</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If algorithm Weird lacks guarantees but has the potential to lead to an interesting algorithm Weirder, waiting for Weird’s guarantees delays or prevents the discovery of Weirder.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Natural Evolution as a Counterexample</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Evolution produced human intelligence without proving any theorems.</li>
<li>This demonstrates that guarantees are not a necessity for achieving complex outcomes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The theoretical heuristic, like the experimentalist heuristic, fosters an <strong>objective-driven search</strong> within the space of AI algorithms, which may not be the most effective approach.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-iron-yardsticks-and-their-consequences">The Iron Yardsticks and Their Consequences</h3>
<ul>
<li>The experimentalist and theoretical heuristics act as <strong>iron yardsticks</strong> wielded by gatekeepers in the AI community.</li>
<li>They heavily influence which ideas are shared and explored, limiting the search to algorithms that satisfy these heuristics.</li>
<li>These heuristics can hinder discovery and progress by:
<ul>
<li><strong>Pruning away large parts of the search space</strong>: Algorithms that don’t meet the heuristics are ignored, preventing the exploration of their potential and the stepping stones beyond them.</li>
<li><strong>Fostering a competitive environment</strong>: Researchers focus on outperforming each other in benchmarks rather than collaborating to explore the space of algorithms.</li>
<li><strong>Shifting the focus away from the substance of ideas</strong>: Discussions revolve around performance and guarantees instead of exploring the intrinsic value and potential of new algorithms.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rethinking-good-ai-algorithms-and-a-non-objective-approach">Rethinking “Good” AI Algorithms and a Non-Objective Approach</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>A “good” AI algorithm should be judged by its potential to inspire new algorithms and research directions</strong>, not solely by its performance.</li>
<li>The AI community’s obsession with performance improvements often leads to incremental advancements that lack significant insights.</li>
<li><strong>Algorithms should be evaluated as stepping stones</strong>: The focus should be on whether an algorithm leads to new and interesting algorithms, regardless of its initial performance.</li>
<li><strong>Picbreeder as an Example</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The Picbreeder community successfully finds complex and meaningful images without relying on objective rules, expert panels, or performance comparisons.</li>
<li>This demonstrates that communities can achieve significant results without rigid objective heuristics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Role of Experts</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Expertise is crucial in evaluating new ideas, but objective heuristics should not replace expert judgment.</li>
<li>Experts should be trusted to use their knowledge and intuition to assess the potential of new algorithms, even if they don’t meet traditional performance or theoretical standards.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Journal of AI Discovery (JAID) Thought Experiment</strong>:
<ul>
<li>JAID is a hypothetical journal where reviewers are not allowed to consider experimental or theoretical results in their reviews.</li>
<li>This forces reviewers to engage with the core ideas of an algorithm and judge its potential as a stepping stone based on its intrinsic value.</li>
<li>The success or failure of JAID would reveal insights about the effectiveness of current heuristics and the role of expert judgment in AI research.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="embracing-non-objective-clues-and-the-importance-of-open-mindedness">Embracing Non-Objective Clues and the Importance of Open-mindedness</h3>
<ul>
<li>Relying solely on objective heuristics can hinder the discovery of truly groundbreaking ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Non-objective clues</strong> can provide valuable insights into an algorithm’s potential:
<ul>
<li>Inspiration, elegance, potential to provoke creativity, thought-provoking construction, challenge to the status quo, novelty, analogy to nature, beauty, simplicity, and imagination.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Experts should embrace open-mindedness and consider a broader range of factors when evaluating new ideas</strong>:
<ul>
<li>It’s more challenging to deeply consider an idea’s potential than to rely on simple heuristics.</li>
<li>However, this effort is crucial for fostering innovation and progress in AI research.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Science cannot rely on a fixed method for discovering great ideas</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The most significant advancements often come from unexpected sources and don’t necessarily follow predictable paths.</li>
<li>Open-mindedness and a willingness to explore unconventional ideas are essential for scientific progress.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The AI community, and scientific communities in general, should move beyond rigid objective heuristics and embrace a more open-minded approach to evaluating new ideas, focusing on their potential to inspire further creativity and lead to unforeseen discoveries.<br>
</li>
<li>This shift requires trusting experts to use their judgment and considering a broader range of factors beyond performance and guarantees, ultimately fostering a more fruitful and innovative scientific landscape.</li>
