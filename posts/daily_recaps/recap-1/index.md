## Introduction

Well I didn't actually have much time for anything other than homework today, but I did manage to work on a little bit. I want to clear out some smaller projects on my list before updating the [PoseNet](https://christianjmills.com/Barracuda-PoseNet-Tutorial-1/) tutorial.

## Working With the Blender Python API

I've started cleaning up the code for the small [motion graphics](https://christianjmills.com/Weekly-Recap-4/#working-with-the-blender-python-api) I made with the Blender Python API. The code was basically scratch paper so there was a lot to clean up. I found using arrays and for loops to set up a bunch of keyframes to be a lot easier. I'll try to make posts going through full code for both of the motion graphics this week.

## Compute Shader Course

I purchased the [compute shader course](https://www.udemy.com/course/compute-shaders/) on Udemy that I listed in the [last weekly recap](../../weekly-recaps/#learn-to-write-unity-compute-shaders). Udemy was running one of their big sales so I got it for $11.99. I have only used compute shaders for basic image operations so far and I would like to learn how to do more. I have not come across many resources explaining how to fully utilize compute shaders so I'm looking forward to the course. I plan to make some tutorials based on what I learn from the course as well.
