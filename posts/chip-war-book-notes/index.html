<ul>
<li>On August 18, 2020, the USS Mustin sailed through the Taiwan Strait, a waterway increasingly fraught with geopolitical tension.</li>
<li>This show of force underscored a new reality: <strong>the battle for technological dominance, particularly in semiconductors, has become central to the rivalry between the United States and China.</strong></li>
<li>While the U.S. Navy patrolled the strait, Chinese leaders were more concerned about a U.S. Commerce Department regulation called the <strong>Entity List,</strong> which restricts technology exports.</li>
<li>This regulation targeted <strong>Huawei</strong>, a Chinese tech giant, barring it from buying advanced computer chips made with U.S. technology.
<ul>
<li>This action revealed China’s dependence on foreign-made chips, the essential building blocks of all modern electronics.</li>
<li><strong>China now spends more on importing chips than on oil.</strong></li>

<li>Around the same time Zelenograd was approved, Soviet student <strong>Boris Malin</strong> returned from Pennsylvania with a <strong>Texas Instruments SN-51</strong>, one of the first commercially available integrated circuits.
<ul>
<li><strong>Alexander Shokhin</strong>, head of Soviet microelectronics, saw it as vital to acquire.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Shokhin ordered a group of engineers, including Malin, to “Copy it, one for one, without any deviations” within three months.
<ul>
<li>Soviet scientists were angered, believing they were capable of independent innovation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While the USSR had leading theoretical physicists, they lagged in practical application and manufacturing, especially in high-volume chipmaking.
<ul>
<li>They excelled in quantity, but not quality or purity, crucial for chipmaking.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>COCOM</strong> restrictions also hindered the USSR’s access to advanced technologies, including semiconductor components.
<ul>
<li>The Soviets used shell companies to bypass COCOM, but this was difficult to do on a large scale.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Jack Simplot</strong>, an Idaho billionaire known for his potato empire, invested in <strong>Micron Technology</strong>, a struggling DRAM chip manufacturer.
<ul>
<li>Simplot’s expertise was in potatoes, evident from his “Mr.&nbsp;Spud” license plate, but he understood business in a way that Silicon Valley often didn’t.</li>
<li>Simplot made his fortune by pioneering potato processing techniques that led to a massive contract with McDonald’s.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Micron</strong>, founded in 1978 by brothers <strong>Joe and Ward Parkinson</strong>, entered the DRAM market during a time of intense Japanese dominance.
<ul>
<li>Existing American DRAM producers, including <strong>AMD, National Semiconductor</strong>, and <strong>Intel</strong>, were abandoning the market due to billion-dollar losses from Japanese competition.</li>
<li>Micron, initially focused on chip design, was forced to pivot to manufacturing their own chips after losing their only client, <strong>Mostek</strong>, to Japanese competitor <strong>Fujitsu</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Silicon Valley lobbied the government for protection against Japanese competition, claiming that computer chips were strategic assets unlike commodities like potatoes.</li>
<li>Micron, however, initially opposed government intervention, believing they could compete with the Japanese through aggressive cost-cutting.</li>
<li>Micron secured funding from <strong>Alan Noble</strong> and other Boise investors. Facing continued struggles, they approached <strong>Simplot</strong>, who saw an opportunity in the depressed DRAM market and invested $1 million, later increasing his stake to over a billion dollars.
<ul>
<li>Simplot believed that Japanese competition had turned DRAM into a commodity, and the best time to buy a commodity business was during a downturn.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Micron’s competitive edge stemmed from their relentless focus on cost reduction and innovative manufacturing processes.
<ul>
<li><strong>Ward Parkinson</strong>, Micron’s engineering lead, focused on shrinking the chip size to fit more chips onto each silicon wafer, increasing manufacturing efficiency.</li>
<li>Micron simplified manufacturing processes, using fewer steps and less equipment than competitors.</li>
<li>They modified existing lithography machines to exceed manufacturer specifications and adapted furnaces to process more wafers simultaneously.</li>
<li>Micron’s location in Boise offered lower land and electricity costs compared to California or Japan.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Joe Parkinson instilled a culture of cost-consciousness, dimming lights and emphasizing efficiency to employees. This “sweatshop mentality” was driven by the understanding that Micron’s survival was paramount in a place with limited alternative job opportunities.</li>
<li>Micron’s strategy ultimately succeeded.
<ul>
<li>They survived the Japanese onslaught, while most American DRAM producers were driven out of the market.</li>
<li>Micron acquired <strong>Texas Instruments’</strong> DRAM business and became a major player in the memory chip market.</li>
<li>Their success was attributed to their engineering ingenuity, relentless cost-cutting, and Simplot’s unwavering support.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Andy Grove</strong>, Intel’s President, recognized that the company’s DRAM business was being disrupted by Japanese competition and needed a drastic change.
<ul>
<li>Grove was known for his “paranoid” management style, driven by a fear of competition and failure, which he outlined in his book, <strong>Only the Paranoid Survive</strong>.</li>
<li>Grove’s experiences as a Hungarian refugee escaping Soviet oppression shaped his leadership, emphasizing constant vigilance and a drive to overcome challenges.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite Intel’s history and identity being rooted in memory chips, Grove acknowledged that the DRAM market was no longer viable and a shift was necessary for survival.
<ul>
<li>The decision to abandon DRAM was difficult and emotionally charged for Intel, but Grove recognized the need to disrupt themselves before being overtaken by competitors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Grove initiated a painful restructuring process.
<ul>
<li><strong>Step One</strong>: Laying off over 25% of Intel’s workforce and closing facilities in Silicon Valley, Oregon, Puerto Rico, and Barbados.</li>
<li><strong>Step Two</strong>: Implementing a ruthless approach to improve manufacturing, inspired by Japanese methods.
<ul>
<li><strong>Craig Barrett</strong>, Grove’s deputy, led this effort, pushing for the adoption of rigorous processes.</li>
<li>Intel adopted a “<strong>copy exactly</strong>” manufacturing methodology, replicating the most efficient processes across all facilities to ensure consistency and high yields.</li>
<li>This shift from Silicon Valley’s freewheeling engineering culture to a more disciplined and standardized approach was met with internal resistance but ultimately proved successful in increasing efficiency and reducing costs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Several external factors contributed to Intel’s resurgence:
<ul>
<li>The rising value of the Japanese yen against the dollar made American exports cheaper.</li>
<li>Falling interest rates in the US lowered Intel’s capital costs.</li>
<li>The emergence of <strong>Compaq</strong> and other <strong>IBM PC clones</strong> created a new market for Intel’s microprocessors.</li>
<li>These “clone” manufacturers utilized Intel’s chips and Microsoft’s software, driving down PC prices and fueling mass adoption.</li>

<li><strong>Lee Byung-chul</strong>, founder of <strong>Samsung</strong>, saw an opportunity in the semiconductor industry amidst the US-Japan DRAM wars.
<ul>
<li>Lee, a shrewd businessman who started by trading dried fish and vegetables, believed in building businesses that were “big, strong, and eternal”.</li>
<li>He recognized the potential of semiconductors after witnessing the success of Japanese companies like <strong>Toshiba</strong> and <strong>Fujitsu</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lee was inspired by <strong>Hewlett-Packard’s</strong> journey from a garage startup to a tech giant during a visit to California in 1982.
<ul>
<li>He was determined to replicate their success with Samsung.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite the high capital expenditure and risk involved, Lee decided to invest at least $100 million in semiconductor manufacturing, a move that could have jeopardized his entire business empire.</li>
<li><strong>Support from the South Korean government was crucial</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The government pledged $400 million to develop the country’s semiconductor industry and pressured banks to provide additional loans to companies like Samsung.</li>
<li>This mirrored the Japanese model of government-backed industrial policy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Silicon Valley, eager to undercut Japanese dominance, saw Korean companies as potential allies.
<ul>
<li><strong>Bob Noyce</strong> believed that Korean competition would prevent Japan from monopolizing DRAM production.</li>
<li>Intel and other Silicon Valley companies formed joint ventures with Samsung, providing them with manufacturing contracts and technology.</li>
<li>The logic was “my enemy’s enemy is my friend,” as <strong>Jerry Sanders</strong> stated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Factors that aided Samsung’s rise:
<ul>
<li>US-imposed tariffs on Japanese DRAM chips created an opening for Korean companies.</li>
<li>Lower wages and production costs in South Korea compared to Japan.</li>
<li>Access to US technology through licensing agreements, such as the deal for a 64K DRAM design from <strong>Micron</strong>.</li>

<ul>
<li>By the 1980s, the limitations of manual chip design were becoming apparent as transistor counts increased.
<ul>
<li>Early microprocessors, like Intel’s 4004, were designed by hand, a time-consuming and error-prone process.</li>
<li><strong>Federico Fagan’s</strong> experience designing Intel’s first microprocessor in 1971 highlighted the challenges: he spent six months meticulously drawing the design, which was then transferred to rubylith film and used to create masks for photolithography.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Carver Mead</strong> and <strong>Lynn Conway</strong> revolutionized chip design by introducing a standardized, algorithmic approach.
<ul>
<li><strong>Carver Mead</strong>, a physicist, and <strong>Lynn Conway</strong>, a computer architect at <strong>Xerox PARC</strong>, collaborated to create a set of mathematical design rules that enabled software to automate the chip design process.</li>
<li>Their methodology allowed designers to use a library of pre-designed components instead of drawing every transistor individually. This “<strong>Mead-Conway revolution</strong>” mirrored <strong>Gutenberg’s</strong> invention of the printing press, simplifying chip design and making it more accessible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)</strong> recognized the strategic importance of the Mead-Conway approach and funded initiatives to promote its adoption.
<ul>
<li>They financed programs for university researchers to design and fabricate chips at advanced facilities, fostering a new generation of chip designers.</li>
<li>DARPA’s focus was on building educational infrastructure and supporting research that would maintain America’s lead in microelectronics, recognizing the crucial role of innovation in national security.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <strong>Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC)</strong>, funded by the chip industry, also played a critical role by distributing research grants to universities.
<ul>
<li>Universities like <strong>Carnegie Mellon</strong> and the <strong>University of California, Berkeley</strong> became hubs for semiconductor research, producing graduates who went on to found companies that developed essential software tools for chip design.</li>
<li>These DARPA and SRC-funded programs nurtured an ecosystem of innovation that led to the creation of companies like <strong>Synopsys, Cadence</strong>, and <strong>Mentor Graphics</strong>, which continue to dominate the chip design software industry today.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Erwin Jacobs</strong>, a pioneer in wireless communication, envisioned using increasingly powerful chips to revolutionize data transmission.
<ul>
<li>Jacobs, who co-founded <strong>Qualcomm</strong>, realized that as transistor density increased, chips would be able to encode and decode significantly more data within the limited bandwidth of radio waves.</li>
<li>He predicted that this would lead to a future where large amounts of data could be transmitted wirelessly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DARPA funding was instrumental in Qualcomm’s early success, supporting the development of space communication systems before the company shifted focus to the civilian market.</li>
<li>Jacobs’ story highlights the importance of government funding in supporting early-stage research and development, particularly in capital-intensive fields like semiconductors.</li>
<li>By the end of the 1980s, thanks to these advancements in chip design, manufacturing, and applications, the unthinkable had become reality: Intel released its 486 microprocessor, containing 1.2 million transistors, a testament to the relentless pace of innovation driven by Silicon Valley and its government and academic partners.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Soviet Union, lagging behind the West in semiconductor technology, relied heavily on espionage to acquire Western chips and manufacturing equipment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Directorate T</strong>, a specialized KGB division established in 1963, was tasked with stealing foreign technology to bolster the Soviet semiconductor industry.</li>
<li>The KGB employed various tactics, including:
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct theft:</strong> Stealing physical chips from companies.</li>
<li><strong>Black market purchases:</strong> Acquiring chips through intermediaries and smugglers.</li>
<li><strong>Blackmail:</strong> Targeting Westerners with access to sensitive technology.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Soviet espionage efforts were extensive:
<ul>
<li>The KGB reportedly had a team of 60 agents in San Francisco focused on infiltrating Silicon Valley companies.</li>
<li>The discovery of a sophisticated Soviet listening device using <strong>Texas Instruments</strong> chips disguised as a buoy in 1982 highlighted the reach and sophistication of their operations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The limitations of the “<strong>copy-it</strong>” strategy:
<ul>
<li>While stealing samples or even shipments of chips was relatively straightforward, replicating the complex manufacturing processes was a significant challenge.</li>
<li>As chip complexity increased, the Soviets struggled to produce high-quality copies, rendering their stolen technology less valuable.</li>
<li>This over-reliance on theft hindered the development of indigenous Soviet semiconductor expertise.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Vladimir Vetrov (codename: Farewell):</strong> A disillusioned KGB agent who became a double agent for France.
<ul>
<li>Vetrov, dissatisfied with his career and personal life, leaked thousands of pages of classified documents about Directorate T’s operations to French intelligence, revealing the vast scale of Soviet technology theft.</li>
<li>He was motivated by a desire for a more exciting life and hoped to rekindle a romantic relationship.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Operation Exodus</strong>: A US-led initiative to counter Soviet technology theft, launched in response to Vetrov’s revelations.
<ul>
<li>The program implemented stricter export controls, increased customs inspections, and targeted Soviet acquisition networks.</li>
<li>By 1985, Operation Exodus had seized $600 million worth of goods and led to numerous arrests.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite the KGB’s efforts, the Soviet Union remained technologically inferior to the West in microelectronics.
<ul>
<li>By the mid-1980s, Soviet microprocessors were estimated to be half a decade behind their American counterparts.</li>
<li>The reliance on the copy-it strategy ultimately proved detrimental, hindering innovation and perpetuating dependence on foreign technology.</li>

<li>Soviet ballistic missiles were less accurate than their American counterparts due to the limitations of their onboard computers and guidance systems.</li>
<li>The US <strong>MX missile</strong> was estimated to be significantly more accurate than the Soviet <strong>SS-25</strong>, giving the US a strategic advantage in a potential nuclear conflict.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Anti-submarine warfare</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The US Navy’s use of advanced computers, like the <strong>ILLIAC-4</strong>, for analyzing sonar data significantly enhanced their ability to detect and track Soviet submarines.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conventional warfare</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The effectiveness of US precision-guided munitions, such as the <strong>Paveway</strong> laser-guided bombs and <strong>Tomahawk</strong> cruise missiles, significantly increased the vulnerability of Soviet forces in a conventional conflict.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenges faced by the Soviet semiconductor industry</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Political interference</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The KGB’s influence within the industry hindered efficiency and innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Yuri OShokhin’s</strong> removal from the <strong>Riga semiconductor plant</strong> for refusing to dismiss employees targeted by the KGB exemplified this problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lack of a robust consumer market</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The absence of a large civilian market for electronics limited the growth and innovation of the Soviet semiconductor industry.</li>
<li>This contrasted with the US, Europe, and Japan, where booming consumer markets drove demand for advanced chips.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Limited international collaboration</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The Soviet Union’s isolation during the Cold War prevented it from accessing the global semiconductor supply chain and benefiting from specialization and economies of scale.</li>
<li>In contrast, the US and its allies had established an efficient international division of labor in chip production and innovation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>The 1990s marked a period of decline for the Japanese semiconductor industry and the rise of American dominance.
<ul>
<li>Japan’s economic bubble burst in 1990, leading to a prolonged recession and exposing the weaknesses of its over-investment in certain industries, including semiconductors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Factors contributing to Japan’s semiconductor decline</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Overinvestment and lack of profitability</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Japanese chipmakers, fueled by easy access to capital, continued investing heavily in DRAM production despite declining prices and competition from lower-cost producers like <strong>Micron</strong> and <strong>Samsung</strong>.</li>
<li>This overcapacity led to a DRAM glut and falling profits.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Missed opportunities in new markets</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Japanese companies, with the notable exception of <strong>Sony</strong>, failed to capitalize on the rising PC market and largely ignored the growing demand for microprocessors.</li>
<li>This contrasted with Intel’s successful pivot from DRAM to microprocessors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Slow to adapt to changing market dynamics</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The Japanese model of consensus-driven decision-making, which had been an advantage in the past, hindered their ability to adapt quickly to the rapidly changing semiconductor landscape.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sony</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Sony’s success in developing specialized chips for image sensors highlighted the potential for innovation within the Japanese semiconductor industry.</li>
<li>However, even Sony struggled to maintain profitability in the face of increasing competition and the company’s failure to cut investments in loss-making sectors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The decline of Japan’s semiconductor industry undermined its geopolitical ambitions</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Akio Morita’s</strong>, co-author of “The Japan That Can Say No,” witnessed firsthand the decline of Japan’s economic and technological prowess.</li>
<li>The country’s inability to translate its semiconductor dominance into geopolitical power during the Persian Gulf War further highlighted its limitations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Soviet Union’s collapse</strong>:
<ul>
<li>By 1990, <strong>Mikhail Gorbachev</strong>, recognizing the Soviet Union’s dire economic and technological situation, sought closer ties with the West.</li>
<li>During a visit to Silicon Valley, Gorbachev acknowledged the region’s technological leadership and encouraged US investment in the USSR.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ogarkov’s prediction</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Marshal Ogarkov’s</strong> earlier prediction that the US had effectively won the Cold War due to its superior technology proved accurate.</li>
<li>The Soviet Union’s inability to compete in microelectronics and other advanced technologies significantly contributed to its collapse.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The end of the Cold War</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The US emerged victorious, with Silicon Valley’s technological prowess playing a decisive role in securing this victory.</li>
<li>The semiconductor industry had become a critical driver of both economic and military power.</li>

<ul>
<li>By the 1980s, Taiwan aimed to transition from semiconductor assembly to chip fabrication to capture a larger share of the industry’s profits.
<ul>
<li><strong>Semiconductor assembly</strong>, primarily involving testing and packaging chips made elsewhere, offered lower profits than chip design and production.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<section id="early-efforts-and-challenges" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="early-efforts-and-challenges">Early Efforts and Challenges</h4>
<ul>
<li>Taiwan had been strategically integrating itself into semiconductor supply chains since the 1960s.
<ul>
<li><strong>Goals:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Job creation</li>
<li>Acquisition of advanced technology</li>
<li>Strengthened security ties with the United States</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Early successes included attracting Texas Instruments to build the island’s first semiconductor facility in the 1960s.
<ul>
<li>K.T. Lee, a powerful Taiwanese minister, was instrumental in securing TI’s investment and fostering relationships with its leaders, including Pat Haggerty and Morris Chang.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Taiwan further encouraged electronics firms to establish factories on the island.</li>
<li>Despite these efforts, Taiwan faced challenges in advancing its chipmaking capabilities:
<ul>
<li><strong>UMC</strong>, a Taiwanese chipmaker founded in 1980 using licensed technology from America’s RCA, lagged behind the industry’s cutting edge.</li>
<li><strong>Competition:</strong> Taiwan faced fierce competition from other Asian economies:
<ul>
<li><strong>South Korea:</strong> Samsung and other conglomerates were heavily investing in advanced memory chips.</li>
<li><strong>Singapore and Malaysia:</strong> These countries were attempting to replicate South Korea’s transition from assembly to fabrication, but with limited success.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>China’s Emergence:</strong> The People’s Republic of China’s integration into the global economy posed a significant threat.
<ul>
<li>China’s low wages and vast workforce attracted basic manufacturing and assembly jobs, directly challenging Taiwan’s economic model.</li>

<li>In 1985, Minister K.T. Lee recruited Morris Chang, a seasoned semiconductor industry veteran, to lead Taiwan’s push into chip fabrication.
<ul>
<li>Chang had extensive experience at Texas Instruments, playing a key role in establishing TI’s efficient manufacturing processes and the company’s presence in Taiwan.</li>
<li>He had left TI in the early 1980s after being passed over for the CEO position.</li>
<li>Chang’s deep understanding of the industry and proven track record made him an ideal candidate for the challenging task.</li>

<section id="the-foundry-model-a-radical-idea" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-foundry-model-a-radical-idea">The Foundry Model: A Radical Idea</h4>
<ul>
<li>Chang proposed a radical business model—a <strong>“foundry”—</strong>to propel Taiwan’s semiconductor industry forward.
<ul>
<li>This model involved manufacturing chips designed by other companies rather than designing and producing chips in-house, which was the prevailing industry model at the time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chang had first pitched this idea while at TI in 1976, predicting the rise of <strong>“fabless”</strong> companies that focused solely on chip design.
<ul>
<li>However, TI executives rejected the proposal, deeming it too risky to invest in markets that didn’t yet exist.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The concept gained traction due to several factors:
<ul>
<li><strong>Lynn Conway and Carver Mead’s work:</strong> Their revolution in chip design, which simplified the separation of design and manufacturing, made Chang’s foundry model more feasible.</li>
<li><strong>Growing demand:</strong> Chang anticipated that the decreasing cost of computing power would drive demand for semiconductors in a wide range of new applications, creating opportunities for specialized manufacturers.</li>
<li><strong>Rising manufacturing costs:</strong> As transistors shrank and technology advanced, the cost of manufacturing equipment and R&amp;D became increasingly prohibitive for companies producing smaller volumes of chips.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tsmcs-founding-and-government-support">TSMC’s Founding and Government Support</h4>
<ul>
<li>Minister Lee secured government funding for Chang’s ambitious plan, with the Taiwanese government providing 48% of TSMC’s startup capital.
<ul>
<li>The government also granted generous tax benefits to support the company’s growth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chang’s former colleagues at TI and Intel declined to provide the necessary advanced production technology.
<ul>
<li>Gordon Moore, of Intel, famously told Chang, “Morris, you’ve had a lot of good ideas in your time. This isn’t one of them.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Eventually, Chang secured a deal with Philips, the Dutch semiconductor company:
<ul>
<li>Philips invested $58 million, transferred its production technology, and licensed intellectual property to TSMC in exchange for a 27.5% stake.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The remaining capital was raised from wealthy Taiwanese families, often through government pressure and appeals to their past successes with government support.</li>
<li>From its inception, TSMC operated as a project of the Taiwanese state, heavily reliant on government support and funding.</li>

<ul>
<li>TSMC’s foundry model addressed the challenges faced by early fabless chip design firms, providing them with a reliable manufacturing partner and fostering innovation in the industry.
<ul>
<li>Previously, these smaller firms had to rely on larger chipmakers with spare capacity, often facing second-class status, potential intellectual property theft, and inconsistencies in manufacturing processes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>TSMC’s commitment to manufacturing chips designed by its customers, without competing in the design space, built trust and attracted a wide range of clients.</li>
<li>This model, mirroring Carver Mead’s “Gutenberg moment” prediction, significantly lowered the barriers to entry in the chip design industry, leading to a surge in new fabless chip design firms.
<ul>
<li>The availability of affordable, high-quality chip manufacturing enabled these companies to focus on innovation and develop specialized chips for a wide range of applications.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, unlike Gutenberg’s printing press, which spread rapidly across Europe, TSMC’s foundry model, while democratizing chip design, ultimately led to the monopolization of chip manufacturing.
<ul>
<li>The economics of chip fabrication favored large-scale production, with companies like TSMC gaining a significant advantage through higher yields and lower costs per chip.</li>
<li>This dynamic drove relentless consolidation in the industry, with TSMC emerging as the dominant player in the production of the world’s most advanced chips.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Richard Chang</strong>, a devout Christian and semiconductor engineer, aimed to bring advanced chip-making to China.
<ul>
<li>Born in Nanjing in 1948, his family fled to Taiwan when he was one year old after the Communist takeover.</li>
<li>Earned a graduate degree in Buffalo, New York, and worked at Texas Instruments, gaining expertise in operating fabs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In 2000, Chang founded <strong>Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC)</strong> in Shanghai.
<ul>
<li>Secured over $1.5 billion from international investors, with an estimated half coming from U.S. investors.</li>
<li>Hired hundreds of foreign experts, including at least 400 from Taiwan, to operate SMIC’s fab.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chang’s strategy mirrored TSMC’s successful approach in Taiwan:
<ul>
<li>Recruit the best engineers with experience at advanced chip firms.</li>
<li>Invest in the best equipment.</li>
<li>Prioritize employee training in industry best practices.</li>
<li>Leverage government tax and subsidy benefits.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>SMIC’s aggressive hiring strategy:
<ul>
<li>Focused on recruiting experienced engineers from overseas chipmakers, primarily Taiwan.</li>
<li><strong>“One Old Staffer Brings Along Two New Ones”</strong>: A company slogan emphasizing the need for experienced foreign-trained employees to train local engineers.</li>
<li>Foreign-trained workforce proved crucial for SMIC’s success in domesticating technology.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Workforce Composition (Doug Fuller’s analysis):
<ul>
<li>In 2001: 650 local engineers and 393 recruited from overseas (mostly Taiwan and the U.S.).</li>
<li>Throughout the 2000s: Approximately one-third of engineering employees were hired from abroad.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>SMIC’s Successes:
<ul>
<li>Benefited from significant government support (five-year corporate tax holiday, reduced sales tax on chips sold in China).</li>
<li>Focused on manufacturing quality and adopting near cutting-edge technology.</li>
<li>Secured contracts to build chips for industry leaders like Texas Instruments.</li>
<li>Listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange in 2004.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Context:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The US emerged from the Cold War as a global superpower.</li>
<li>Globalization and interconnectedness were seen as inevitable and positive.</li>
<li>Intel dominated the microprocessor market.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Intel’s Consortium:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>1996</strong>: Intel partnered with US Department of Energy labs (e.g., Lawrence Livermore, Sandia) to advance EUV.</li>
<li>Goal: Transition EUV from scientific research to mass production.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Choosing ASML:</strong>
<ul>
<li>US firms (GCA defunct, SVG lagging) couldn’t commercialize EUV.</li>
<li>Government opposed Japanese involvement (Nikon, Canon) due to past trade tensions.</li>
<li>ASML, despite being foreign, became the only viable option.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Concerns and Justifications:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Government Concerns:</strong> Giving a foreign company access to sensitive national lab research raised concerns about future access to critical technology.</li>
<li><strong>Counterarguments:</strong>
<ul>
<li>No immediate military application for EUV.</li>
<li>EUV’s success was not guaranteed.</li>
<li>ASML (and the Netherlands) were seen as reliable partners.</li>
<li>Job creation through an ASML facility in the US was prioritized.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Industry Perspective:</strong> Focused on efficient semiconductor production; ASML was the only company capable of delivering EUV.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>ASML’s Monopoly:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nikon and Canon, excluded from US research, abandoned EUV development.</li>
<li><strong>2001</strong>: ASML acquired SVG (US’s last major lithography firm).
<ul>
<li><strong>Concerns:</strong> Further consolidated EUV technology under ASML.</li>
<li><strong>Justifications:</strong>

<li>Necessary for EUV progress and the future of computing (argued by Intel CEO Craig Barrett).</li>
<li>Aligned with the Bush administration’s policy of promoting globalization and loosening export controls.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Outcome:</strong>
<ul>
<li>EUV development continued with ASML as the sole supplier.</li>

<li>Despite growing up raising livestock, Zhao aspired for more than a rural life.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Education and Early Career:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Zhao gained admission to Tsinghua University, one of China’s top institutions, where he studied electrical engineering.
<ul>
<li>Note: Tsinghua University has been at the forefront of China’s semiconductor efforts since the industry’s beginnings in the country.</li>
<li>It’s unclear how much semiconductor-specific knowledge Zhao acquired during his studies.</li>

<li>After graduating, he worked at a tech company before transitioning into investing as a vice president at Tsinghua Uni Group.
<ul>
<li><strong>Tsinghua Uni Group:</strong> Established by Tsinghua University to commercialize its research, the company seemingly focused heavily on real estate investments.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Investment Success:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Zhao earned a reputation for skillful corporate deal-making, setting him on a path to substantial wealth.</li>
<li><strong>2004:</strong> Zhao founded his own investment firm, Beijing Jiankun Group.

<li><strong>2009:</strong> Zhao acquired a 49% stake in his former employer, Tsinghua Uni Group, with the university retaining the remaining 51%.
<ul>
<li><strong>Unusual Transaction:</strong> This raised eyebrows as it meant a private real estate investment firm now held significant control over a company meant to commercialize technology from a leading research university.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tsinghua Unigroup’s Political Connections:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The company wasn’t a typical business entity. It had strong ties to the Chinese Communist Party:
<ul>
<li>The son of former Chinese President Hu Jintao, reportedly a personal friend of Zhao’s, held the position of Communist Party Secretary for the holding company that owned Unigroup.</li>
<li>The president of Tsinghua University during the 2000s was a former college roommate of Xi Jinping.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>2013:</strong> Zhao shifted focus to the chip industry, a move that coincided with the Chinese Communist Party’s announcement of major subsidies for domestic semiconductor companies.
<ul>
<li><strong>Zhao’s Claim:</strong> He denies that Tsinghua Unigroup’s semiconductor strategy was a reaction to the government’s plans, stating, “Everyone thinks that the government is pushing the development of the chip sector, but it’s not like that” (Forbes, 2015).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ben Buchanan’s Triad of AI:</strong> Georgetown University’s Ben Buchanan identifies three key elements for AI development: data, algorithms, and computing power. While the U.S. currently leads in computing power, China is rapidly catching up in the other two areas.</li>
<li><strong>Data Access:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>China’s Argument:</strong> Proponents of China’s AI development point to the country’s vast surveillance state and massive population as advantages for data collection.</li>
<li><strong>Counterargument:</strong> The type of data collected through mass surveillance might not be as relevant for military AI applications.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Neither China nor the U.S. has a clear advantage in gathering militarily relevant data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Algorithm Development:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>China’s Strengths:</strong> China possesses a substantial pool of AI talent, with <strong>29%</strong> of the world’s leading AI researchers being from China, compared to <strong>20%</strong> from the U.S. and <strong>18%</strong> from Europe (Marco Polo think tank).</li>
<li><strong>US Strengths:</strong> The U.S. attracts and retains a significant portion of global AI talent, employing <strong>59%</strong> of the world’s top AI researchers.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Shift:</strong> Changes in U.S. visa policies, increased efforts by China to retain its researchers, and growing opportunities within China’s tech sector could erode America’s advantage in attracting top talent.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Computing Power:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Situation:</strong> While the U.S. maintains a lead in computing power, China’s dependence on foreign semiconductors, particularly U.S.-designed, Taiwan-manufactured processors, is a major vulnerability.
<ul>
<li>This dependence extends to data centers crucial for AI workloads.</li>
<li>A Chinese study estimates that <strong>95% of GPUs</strong> in Chinese servers running AI applications are NVIDIA-designed, highlighting reliance on U.S. technology.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>China’s Domestic Chip Production Efforts:</strong> While China is investing heavily in domestic chip production, experts predict it will be at least five years before they can design and several more before they can manufacture chips that rival the West.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>China’s Acquisition of U.S. Chips:</strong> Despite export controls, the PLA has managed to acquire U.S.-designed chips for military use.
<ul>
<li>A Georgetown University study analyzing 343 PLA procurement contracts for AI-related systems found that less than <strong>20%</strong> involved companies subject to U.S. export controls.</li>
<li>This indicates the effectiveness of China’s <strong>civil-military fusion</strong> policy, enabling the transfer of advanced civilian technology to military applications.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenges-to-chinas-technological-independence">Challenges to China’s Technological Independence</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multinational Supply Chains</strong>: Achieving complete technological independence in an industry with such complex and interconnected supply chains is incredibly difficult, even for the US.
<ul>
<li>China lacks competitive firms in key parts of the supply chain, including machinery and software, making independence even more challenging.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Replicating ASML’s EUV Machines</strong>:
<ul>
<li>EUV machines, crucial for producing advanced chips, took ASML almost three decades to develop and commercialize.</li>
<li>Replicating just the laser component requires assembling <strong>457,329 parts</strong> flawlessly.</li>
<li>Even with stolen design specs, the complexity of these machines cannot be easily replicated without decades of engineering experience and expertise.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>High Cost of Domestication</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Domesticating every aspect of the chip supply chain would be astronomically expensive.</li>
<li>The global chip industry spends over <strong>$100 billion</strong> annually on capital expenditures.</li>
<li>China would need to match this spending while also building a foundation of expertise and infrastructure, costing well over <strong>$1 trillion</strong> over a decade.</li>

<li><strong>Focus on Reducing US Reliance</strong>: China recognizes the impossibility of complete domestication and instead aims to lessen its reliance on the US in specific areas and increase its overall influence in the chip industry.</li>
<li><strong>Embracing RISC-V Architecture</strong>:
<ul>
<li>RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture, offering a free alternative to the dominant x86 (Intel, AMD) and ARM architectures.</li>
<li>Its open nature potentially reduces security risks, fosters faster innovation, and appeals to Chinese companies seeking geopolitical neutrality.</li>
<li>Alibaba is among the Chinese firms designing processors based on RISC-V.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Leveraging Older Process Technology</strong>:
<ul>
<li>While smartphones and data centers demand cutting-edge chips, other devices like cars can function on older, cheaper technology.</li>
<li>China is investing heavily in lagging-edge logic chip production, a segment less vulnerable to US export restrictions on older equipment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Investing in Emerging Materials</strong>:
<ul>
<li>China is focusing on silicon carbide and gallium nitride, materials with potential in electric vehicle power management systems.</li>
<li>Government subsidies in this area could give Chinese companies a competitive price advantage.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Growing Market Share</strong>:
<ul>
<li>China’s share of global chip fabrication is projected to rise from <strong>15%</strong> to <strong>24%</strong> by 2030, surpassing Taiwan and South Korea in volume, although potentially lagging behind technologically.</li>
<li>This increased market share could give China more leverage in demanding technology transfer and make it costlier for the US to impose export restrictions.</li>
