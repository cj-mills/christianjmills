## Chapter 1: From Steel to Silicon 

### World War II: A "Typhoon of Steel"

- Japanese soldiers described World War II as a "typhoon of steel." 

#### Akio Morita's Wartime Experience

- **Akio Morita**, a young engineer from a family of sake merchants, narrowly avoided front-line service in World War II due to his assignment to a Japanese Navy engineering lab.
- Morita witnessed the devastation inflicted on Japan by American B-29 Superfortress bombers, which destroyed much of Tokyo and other urban centers.
- The American blockade of Japan created widespread hunger and forced the country into desperate measures, such as training Morita's brothers as kamikaze pilots.

#### Morris Chang's Wartime Experience

- **Morris Chang's** childhood was marked by the sounds of gunfire and air raid sirens as Japanese armies swept across China.
- Chang and his family became refugees, fleeing to Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Chongqing, and finally back to Shanghai after Japan's defeat.
- The war's end didn't bring peace to China, as communist guerrillas resumed their fight against the Chinese government, forcing Chang to flee to Hong Kong for a second time.

#### Andy Grove's Wartime Experience

- **Andy Grove**, then known as András Grof, endured multiple invasions of Budapest during World War II.
- Hungary's far-right government treated Jews like Grove's family as second-class citizens. Despite this, Grove's father was drafted into the army and sent to fight alongside the Nazis against the Soviet Union, where he went missing in action at Stalingrad.
- In 1944, Nazi Germany invaded Hungary, their supposed ally, with plans to deport Jews like Grove to death camps.
- Grove and his mother hid in a bomb shelter as the Red Army liberated Budapest, but the Soviet occupation brought its own share of suffering, including the rape of Grove's mother.

### America's Industrial Might: Deciding Factor in World War II

- World War II was a conflict of industrial attrition, a struggle that the United States, with its vast manufacturing capacity, was well-positioned to win.
- The War Production Board in Washington measured success in terms of raw materials like copper, iron, rubber, oil, aluminum, and tin, as America transformed its industrial base to churn out military hardware.
- The United States outproduced the Axis powers in every major category of war material, building more tanks, ships, planes, artillery, and machine guns than its enemies combined.
- Convoys of American-made goods flowed across the Atlantic and Pacific, supplying Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and other Allied nations with vital resources.
- While the war was fought by soldiers and sailors, the fighting power that ultimately decided the conflict was produced on American assembly lines in places like Kaiser shipyards and the River Rouge plant.

### The Dawn of a New Technological Era

- Despite the dominance of industrial output in determining the outcome of World War II, new technologies, particularly in the realm of electronics, were already transforming military power.
- While mass-producing planes and tanks by the thousands, the great powers invested heavily in research labs that yielded innovations like rockets and radar.
- The atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki dramatically illustrated the potential of emerging technologies to reshape warfare, sparking speculation about a future "atomic age" that would supersede the era of coal and steel.

#### Akio Morita's Vision of the Future of Warfare

- Although too young to have been deeply involved in wartime technological developments, Morris Chang and Andy Grove witnessed the shifting technological landscape. Akio Morita, in his early twenties, had a more direct view.
- Morita's experience developing heat-seeking missiles, although far from practical deployment, provided a glimpse into a future where wars might be won not by sheer industrial output but by sophisticated weaponry capable of autonomous targeting and maneuvering.
- This notion, seemingly like science fiction at the time, was underpinned by Morita's awareness of advances in electronic computation. These advances hinted at the possibility of machines performing complex calculations, essentially "thinking" by solving mathematical problems.

### The Evolution of Computing

- The concept of using devices to aid computation was not new. Humans had long relied on tools like the abacus to manipulate numbers.
- The rise of large organizations in government and business during the late 19th and early 20th centuries created a surge in demand for "human computers" - clerks equipped with pen, paper, and mechanical calculators.
- These human computers performed essential tasks such as processing payrolls, tracking sales, compiling census data, and analyzing statistics for insurance purposes. 
- The Works Progress Administration's Mathematical Tables Project during the Great Depression illustrated both the potential and limitations of human-powered computation. The project employed hundreds of human computers to generate volumes of tables for complex mathematical functions, a valuable but time-consuming and laborious endeavor.

#### The Need for More Powerful Computing

- The demand for faster and more efficient computation continued to grow, particularly in military applications.
- Mechanical bombsights, for instance, were developed to improve bombing accuracy, but their limited input-output capabilities and reliance on precise conditions restricted their effectiveness.
- Achieving greater accuracy in targeting and other military applications necessitated more sophisticated calculations, pushing the development of more powerful computing devices.

### From Mechanical Gears to Vacuum Tubes: A New Era of Computing

- The limitations of mechanical computers led to the exploration of electronic alternatives.
- Early electronic computers employed **vacuum tubes**, glass-enclosed filaments that could be switched on and off to represent the 1s and 0s of binary code.
- **Binary counting**, using only 1s and 0s, could theoretically represent any number, enabling a wide range of computations.
- Unlike the fixed functionality of mechanical computers, vacuum tube-based computers were **reprogrammable**, allowing for greater versatility.
- Despite the advantages of vacuum tubes, they came with significant drawbacks:
  - **Attracted insects:**  The heat generated by the tubes made them attractive to moths and other insects, often leading to malfunctions.
  - **Burned out frequently:**  Vacuum tubes were prone to burning out, just like lightbulbs, requiring constant replacement.

#### ENIAC: A Powerful but Cumbersome Computer

- **ENIAC**, built for the U.S. Army in 1945, exemplified the capabilities and limitations of early vacuum tube computers.
- ENIAC could perform hundreds of multiplications per second but occupied an entire room due to its 18,000 fist-sized vacuum tubes.
- The high failure rate of the tubes meant frequent breakdowns, halting operations and requiring technicians to locate and replace faulty components.

#### The Search for a Better Alternative

- ENIAC demonstrated the potential computing power of vacuum tubes but also highlighted their impracticality for widespread use.
- The search for a smaller, faster, more reliable, and less cumbersome alternative to the vacuum tube became paramount in advancing the field of computing.

  * **Semiconductors:** Unique materials like silicon and germanium that can conduct electricity under specific conditions, unlike conductors (e.g., copper) or insulators (e.g., glass).

### Shockley's Solid-State Valve Theory

* In 1945, Shockley theorized a **solid-state valve** using a piece of silicon and a 90-volt battery.
  * He hypothesized that an electric field could attract free electrons in the silicon, making its edge conductive and allowing current to flow.
  * His initial experiment failed to produce measurable results due to the limitations of instruments at the time.

### Brattain and Bardeen's Breakthrough

* Two of Shockley's colleagues at Bell Labs, **Walter Brattain** and **John Bardeen**, built a device with two gold filaments touching a germanium block.
  * On December 16, 1947, they successfully controlled the current flow across the germanium, proving Shockley's theories.
  * This device was later named the **transistor**.

### Transistor's Initial Applications and Shockley's Response

* **AT&T**, Bell Labs' parent company, saw the transistor's potential for amplifying signals in telephones.
* Transistors were also recognized as replacements for vacuum tubes in hearing aids and radios.
* Shockley, furious at being outdone, locked himself in a Chicago hotel room and conceived of a new **three-layer transistor** design.
  * This design amplified current and functioned as a switch by manipulating a small current to control a larger one.

### Public Announcement and Significance

* Bell Labs announced the transistor in June 1948, but the news was met with little fanfare. 
  * _"Little brain cell"_, Time magazine, 1948. 
* The significance of these "wired blocks of germanium" as replacements for human brains in computing was unimaginable at the time.

#### Gordon Moore's Prediction

- In 1965, **Gordon Moore**, co-founder of Fairchild, published an article predicting that the number of components on an integrated circuit would double every year for the next decade.
  - This prediction, which came to be known as **Moore's Law**, proved remarkably accurate and had profound implications for the future of computing.

#### Implications of Moore's Law

- **Exponential Growth in Computing Power:** Moore's Law implied that computing power would increase exponentially over time.
- **Decreasing Costs:** As transistors became smaller and more densely packed, the cost per transistor would decrease, making computers more affordable and accessible.
- **Expanding Applications:** As computing power became cheaper and more readily available, it would find its way into a wider range of products and applications.

### Fairchild's Strategic Shift

#### The "McNamara Depression" and Its Impact

- In the early 1960s, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara implemented cost-cutting measures that reduced military spending on electronics, impacting companies like Fairchild.
- This "McNamara Depression" reinforced Noyce's belief in the importance of developing civilian markets for integrated circuits.

#### Focus on Civilian Products

- Fairchild became the first company to offer a full line of off-the-shelf integrated circuits designed specifically for civilian applications.

#### Price Cuts to Drive Adoption

- Noyce aggressively cut prices for Fairchild's integrated circuits, even selling some products below cost, to encourage wider adoption and stimulate demand.

### The Rise of the Civilian Computer Market

#### Rapid Growth of the Computer Industry

- The computer industry experienced explosive growth in the 1960s, with annual sales increasing from 1,000 units in 1957 to 18,700 units in 1967.

#### Fairchild's Dominance

- By the mid-1960s, nearly all new computers used integrated circuits, and Fairchild captured a dominant share of this rapidly expanding market.

#### The Burroughs Contract

- In 1966, Fairchild secured a major contract with **Burroughs**, a leading computer manufacturer, for 20 million integrated circuits.
- This contract, far larger than any previous order from NASA or the military, signaled the shift in demand towards the civilian market.

### The Allure of Wealth and the Exodus from Fairchild

#### Financial Incentives Drive Innovation

- The potential for financial gain became a powerful motivator for engineers and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley.

#### Fairchild's Restrictive Stock Option Policy

- Fairchild's owner, Sherman Fairchild, refused to grant stock options to employees, limiting their ability to share in the company's success.

#### The Search for Riches

- As Fairchild's success attracted competition, many talented engineers and executives left to start their own companies or join rivals, enticed by the promise of greater financial rewards.
- This exodus of talent led to the formation of numerous new semiconductor companies, further accelerating innovation and competition in the industry.

## Chapter 7: Soviet Silicon Valley

### The Arrival of Soviet Engineers in Silicon Valley

* **Anatoly Trutko**, a Soviet semiconductor engineer, arrived at Stanford University in 1959 as part of a student exchange program. 
  * This was surprising given US fears of the USSR catching up in science and technology.
  * Trutko studied advanced technology, even attending lectures by **William Shockley**. 
    *  After one class, Trutko asked Shockley to sign his book, *Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors*.
    *  Shockley complained to Trutko that the USSR refused to pay royalties for the book's Russian translation.
* The USSR understood the value of semiconductors.
  * They translated Shockley's textbook into Russian just two years after it was published.
  * US spies were ordered to acquire Soviet semiconductor devices as early as 1956 to assess their quality. 
    * A 1959 CIA report found that America was only two to four years ahead of the Soviets in transistor quality and quantity.
* At least several early Soviet exchange students were later revealed to be KGB agents.
  * This highlights the link between student exchanges and Soviet defense industry goals. 
* Both the Pentagon and the Kremlin understood that **transistors** and **integrated circuits** would revolutionize manufacturing, computing, and military power.
  * Starting in the late 1950s, the USSR established new semiconductor facilities and assigned top scientists to this industry.

###  Yuri Osokyan and the Rise of Soviet Semiconductor Research

* **Yuri Osokyan** was a talented young Soviet engineer tasked with advancing Soviet semiconductor technology.
  * He spent his childhood in China, where his father worked in a Soviet military hospital.
  * He was known for his exceptional memory and expertise in semiconductors.
* Osokyan was assigned to a semiconductor plant in Riga, Latvia.
  * The plant was staffed by top graduates and tasked with building devices for the Soviet space program and military.
* Osokyan was tasked with building a circuit with multiple components on a single piece of germanium, something never done before in the Soviet Union.
  * He created his prototype **integrated circuit** in 1962. 
  * Osokyan and his colleagues were aware they were at the forefront of Soviet science.
  * They were dedicated to their work, spending evenings discussing solid-state physics.

### Khrushchev's Vision for Soviet Semiconductor Dominance

* Soviet leader **Nikita Khrushchev** aimed to surpass the United States in all areas, including technology.
* **Alexander Shokhin**, First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet State Committee on Radio-Electronics, saw an opportunity to leverage Khrushchev's ambition.
  * He told Khrushchev, "Imagine, Nikita Sergeyevich, that a TV can be made the size of a cigarette box," highlighting the potential of Soviet silicon. 
* Shokhin believed catching up to and surpassing the United States was possible.
* Similar to their approach with nuclear weapons, the USSR had a secret weapon: **espionage**.

### Joel Barr and Alfred Sarant: From American Spies to Soviet Computer Pioneers

*  **Joel Barr** and **Alfred Sarant** were American electrical engineers who became Soviet spies.
   * They were childhood friends, both sons of Russian Jewish immigrants, and active in the Young Communist League. 
   * They were recruited into a KGB espionage ring led by **Julius Rosenberg**.
*  During the 1940s, Barr and Sarant worked on classified radar and military systems at leading American tech firms.
   * They gained knowledge about electronics in new weapon systems.
*  As the FBI closed in on the Rosenberg ring, Barr and Sarant fled to the Soviet Union.
   *  They told the KGB they wanted to build advanced computers. 
   *  Though not computer experts, their spy status gave them access to resources.
*  In the late 1950s, Barr and Sarant began building the UMM computer ("mind" in Russian).
   *  Their work got the attention of Shokhin. 

### Zelenograd: The Dream of a Soviet Silicon Valley 

* Barr, Sarant, and Shokhin partnered to convince Khrushchev to create a city dedicated to semiconductor production.
  * They envisioned a city with its own researchers, engineers, labs, and production facilities.
* To persuade Khrushchev, Shokhin arranged for him to visit Leningrad's Special Design Bureau of the Electronics Industry No. 2.
  *  During the visit, Sarant and Barr showcased Soviet microelectronics achievements, including a miniature radio and a basic computer.
  *  They argued that semiconductors would be crucial for spacecraft, industry, government, aircraft, and even the nuclear missile shield. 
* They presented Khrushchev with plans for a futuristic semiconductor city centered around a 52-story skyscraper. 
  *  Khrushchev loved grand projects and approved the idea.
* The Soviet government soon greenlit the construction of **Zelenograd** ("green city" in Russian) on Moscow's outskirts.
  * Shokhin envisioned a self-sufficient scientific paradise with research labs, production facilities, schools, daycare, entertainment, libraries, and a hospital. 
  * The **Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology** was built in Zelenograd, modeled after English and American universities.



## Chapter 8: Copy It

### The "Copy It" Strategy and Its Limitations

* Around the same time Zelenograd was approved, Soviet student **Boris Malin** returned from Pennsylvania with a **Texas Instruments SN-51**, one of the first commercially available integrated circuits.
  * **Alexander Shokhin**, head of Soviet microelectronics, saw it as vital to acquire. 
* Shokhin ordered a group of engineers, including Malin, to "Copy it, one for one, without any deviations" within three months. 
  *  Soviet scientists were angered, believing they were capable of independent innovation.
* While the USSR had leading theoretical physicists, they lagged in practical application and manufacturing, especially in high-volume chipmaking.
  * They excelled in quantity, but not quality or purity, crucial for chipmaking. 
* **COCOM** restrictions also hindered the USSR's access to advanced technologies, including semiconductor components.
  *  The Soviets used shell companies to bypass COCOM, but this was difficult to do on a large scale. 

### The Limitations of Espionage in Semiconductor Production

*  Simply stealing a chip didn't reveal how it was made. 
   * The chipmaking process required specialized knowledge, often unwritten, about temperatures, chemicals, and exposure times.
   * Soviet spies couldn't easily steal this type of knowledge.
*  Additionally, the rapid pace of innovation, driven by **Moore's Law**, meant stolen designs quickly became obsolete.
   * American companies introduced new, more powerful chips annually. 

### The Structural Flaws of the Soviet Semiconductor Industry

*  The Soviet leadership didn't grasp how the "copy it" strategy ensured their technological backwardness. 
*  The entire Soviet semiconductor industry operated like a secretive, top-down defense contractor.
   *  There was little room for creativity or market-driven innovation.
   *  Civilian products were a low priority. 
*  This system stifled innovation and condemned them to follow the US lead, even in such a sensitive industry.
*  Zelenograd, despite its resources and stolen secrets, could not replicate Silicon Valley's success.
   *  Soviet engineers lacked the practical, on-the-factory-floor experience of their American counterparts.
   *  Career advancement in the USSR favored bureaucracy over innovation.



## Chapter 9: The Transistor Salesman

### Japan's Post-War Economic Transformation

* In 1962, Japanese Prime Minister **Hayato Ikeda** gifted French President **Charles de Gaulle** a Sony transistor radio. 
  *  De Gaulle, dismissive of Japan as a mere "economic power," scoffed that Ikeda behaved like a "transistor salesman."
* This chapter highlights how Japan's semiconductor industry would make it wealthy and powerful.
* Integrated circuits not only revolutionized electronics, but also connected nations, with the US at the center.
* Unlike the USSR, Japan deliberately integrated itself into the US semiconductor industry, supported by Japanese business leaders and the US government.

###  The US Role in Japan's Technological Rebirth

*  After World War II, some in the US favored dismantling Japan's high-tech industries as punishment. 
*  However, US defense officials soon adopted a policy of supporting a strong Japan as a Cold War strategy.
   * The aim was to rebuild Japan's economy while tying it to the US-led system.
   * Making Japan a "transistor salesman" became central to this strategy. 

### Makoto Kikuchi and the Introduction of the Transistor to Japan

*  **Makoto Kikuchi**, a young physicist at the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tokyo, was among the first in Japan to learn about the transistor. 
*  He stayed informed through US scientific journals, which were otherwise unavailable in postwar Japan.
*  In 1953, Kikuchi met **John Bardeen**, co-inventor of the transistor, during Bardeen's visit to Tokyo for a physics conference. 

### Akio Morita and Sony's Embrace of the Transistor

* In 1953, **Akio Morita**, co-founder of Sony, traveled to New York and secured a license from AT&T to produce transistors.
  * AT&T believed the transistor's use was limited to hearing aids.
* Morita, however, recognized the transistor's potential to transform consumer electronics. 
  * He aimed to sell these devices not just in Japan, but also in the US, the world's biggest consumer market.
* Japan's government, through MITI (Ministry of International Trade and Industry), supported the growth of its electronics firms. 
  *  However, their bureaucracy sometimes clashed with the private sector. 

###  Sony's Innovation and the Rise of Japanese Electronics

* Unlike the USSR's "copy it" approach, Sony focused on **innovation**, **product design**, and **marketing**.
* They licensed transistor technology but excelled at identifying and targeting new markets with desirable products. 
  *  "Our plan is to lead the public with new products rather than ask them what kind of products they want," Morita declared. "The public does not know what is possible, but we do."
* Sony's transistor radios were a major success. 
* Japanese firms, leveraging lower wages and US technology, became major players in consumer electronics.

### A Symbiotic Relationship

## Chapter 29: We Want a Semiconductor Industry in Taiwan

### Taiwan's Semiconductor Ambitions (1960s-1980s)

- By the 1980s, Taiwan aimed to transition from semiconductor assembly to chip fabrication to capture a larger share of the industry's profits.
  - **Semiconductor assembly**, primarily involving testing and packaging chips made elsewhere, offered lower profits than chip design and production.

#### Early Efforts and Challenges

- Taiwan had been strategically integrating itself into semiconductor supply chains since the 1960s.
  - **Goals:** 
    - Job creation
    - Acquisition of advanced technology
    - Strengthened security ties with the United States
- Early successes included attracting Texas Instruments to build the island's first semiconductor facility in the 1960s.
  - K.T. Lee, a powerful Taiwanese minister, was instrumental in securing TI's investment and fostering relationships with its leaders, including Pat Haggerty and Morris Chang.
- Taiwan further encouraged electronics firms to establish factories on the island. 
- Despite these efforts, Taiwan faced challenges in advancing its chipmaking capabilities:
  - **UMC**, a Taiwanese chipmaker founded in 1980 using licensed technology from America's RCA, lagged behind the industry's cutting edge.
  - **Competition:** Taiwan faced fierce competition from other Asian economies:
    - **South Korea:** Samsung and other conglomerates were heavily investing in advanced memory chips.
    - **Singapore and Malaysia:** These countries were attempting to replicate South Korea's transition from assembly to fabrication, but with limited success.
  - **China's Emergence:** The People's Republic of China's integration into the global economy posed a significant threat.
    - China's low wages and vast workforce attracted basic manufacturing and assembly jobs, directly challenging Taiwan's economic model.
    - Taiwanese officials perceived this as "economic warfare," as competing with China on price was deemed impossible.

### Morris Chang and the Birth of TSMC (1985)

- In 1985, Minister K.T. Lee recruited Morris Chang, a seasoned semiconductor industry veteran, to lead Taiwan's push into chip fabrication.
  - Chang had extensive experience at Texas Instruments, playing a key role in establishing TI's efficient manufacturing processes and the company's presence in Taiwan.
  - He had left TI in the early 1980s after being passed over for the CEO position.
  - Chang's deep understanding of the industry and proven track record made him an ideal candidate for the challenging task.

#### The Foundry Model: A Radical Idea

- Chang proposed a radical business model—a **"foundry"—**to propel Taiwan's semiconductor industry forward.
  - This model involved manufacturing chips designed by other companies rather than designing and producing chips in-house, which was the prevailing industry model at the time.
- Chang had first pitched this idea while at TI in 1976, predicting the rise of **"fabless"** companies that focused solely on chip design.
  - However, TI executives rejected the proposal, deeming it too risky to invest in markets that didn't yet exist.
- The concept gained traction due to several factors:
  - **Lynn Conway and Carver Mead's work:** Their revolution in chip design, which simplified the separation of design and manufacturing, made Chang's foundry model more feasible.
  - **Growing demand:** Chang anticipated that the decreasing cost of computing power would drive demand for semiconductors in a wide range of new applications, creating opportunities for specialized manufacturers.
  - **Rising manufacturing costs:** As transistors shrank and technology advanced, the cost of manufacturing equipment and R&D became increasingly prohibitive for companies producing smaller volumes of chips.

#### TSMC's Founding and Government Support

- Minister Lee secured government funding for Chang's ambitious plan, with the Taiwanese government providing 48% of TSMC's startup capital.
  - The government also granted generous tax benefits to support the company's growth.
- Chang's former colleagues at TI and Intel declined to provide the necessary advanced production technology.
  - Gordon Moore, of Intel, famously told Chang, "Morris, you've had a lot of good ideas in your time. This isn't one of them."
- Eventually, Chang secured a deal with Philips, the Dutch semiconductor company:
  - Philips invested $58 million, transferred its production technology, and licensed intellectual property to TSMC in exchange for a 27.5% stake.
- The remaining capital was raised from wealthy Taiwanese families, often through government pressure and appeals to their past successes with government support. 
- From its inception, TSMC operated as a project of the Taiwanese state, heavily reliant on government support and funding.

### TSMC's Success and the Rise of Taiwan's Chip Dominance

#### TSMC's Symbiotic Relationship with Silicon Valley

- TSMC's early success was deeply intertwined with the U.S. chip industry.
  - Many of TSMC's top executives and engineers had experience working at leading Silicon Valley companies like Motorola, Intel, and TI, bringing valuable expertise to the company. 
  - A significant portion of TSMC's early customers were U.S.-based chip designers.
  - By the mid-1990s, American companies accounted for half of TSMC's sales.

#### The Foundry Model's Impact: Democratization and Monopolization

- TSMC's foundry model addressed the challenges faced by early fabless chip design firms, providing them with a reliable manufacturing partner and fostering innovation in the industry. 
  - Previously, these smaller firms had to rely on larger chipmakers with spare capacity, often facing second-class status, potential intellectual property theft, and inconsistencies in manufacturing processes.
- TSMC's commitment to manufacturing chips designed by its customers, without competing in the design space, built trust and attracted a wide range of clients. 
- This model, mirroring Carver Mead's "Gutenberg moment" prediction, significantly lowered the barriers to entry in the chip design industry, leading to a surge in new fabless chip design firms.
  - The availability of affordable, high-quality chip manufacturing enabled these companies to focus on innovation and develop specialized chips for a wide range of applications.
- However, unlike Gutenberg's printing press, which spread rapidly across Europe, TSMC's foundry model, while democratizing chip design, ultimately led to the monopolization of chip manufacturing.
  - The economics of chip fabrication favored large-scale production, with companies like TSMC gaining a significant advantage through higher yields and lower costs per chip. 
  - This dynamic drove relentless consolidation in the industry, with TSMC emerging as the dominant player in the production of the world's most advanced chips.

#### Conclusion

- Morris Chang's vision, combined with Taiwan's unwavering government support, transformed the island into a global semiconductor powerhouse. 
- TSMC's foundry model revolutionized the chip industry, enabling innovation and driving the widespread adoption of semiconductors in countless devices.
- However, this success came at the cost of increased industry consolidation, with TSMC wielding unprecedented influence over the production of the world's most critical technology.

#### Apple's Proposal and Intel's Refusal

* **Steve Jobs** approached Intel's CEO, **Paul Ottolini**, to build a powerful, computer-style processor for their new product - the iPhone.
* Intel, focused on profit margins and underestimating the iPhone's potential, declined Apple's offer.

#### The Rise of Apple and the Decline of Intel's Mobile Ambitions

* Apple turned to ARM architecture and **Samsung** (as the chip manufacturer) for the iPhone's processor.
* The iPhone's success exceeded all expectations, with Apple's profits from smartphones eventually surpassing Intel's PC processor profits.
* While Intel invested heavily in catching up in the mobile market, they failed to gain a significant foothold against Apple.

### Intel's "Innovator's Dilemma"

* Despite being familiar with **Clayton Christensen**'s concept of the **innovator's dilemma**, Intel fell victim to their own success.
* **The Innovator's Dilemma**: The tendency of established, successful companies to focus on sustaining innovation for existing markets (and higher profit margins), thus neglecting potentially disruptive innovations in smaller, emerging markets. 
* Intel's focus on short-term profit margins, driven by a management culture that prioritized financial engineering over technological leadership, blinded them to the transformative potential of mobile devices. 

#### Key Takeaways:

* Intel's immense profitability in the PC and server markets became a liability.
* Their prioritization of high-profit-margin products stifled innovation in new, potentially disruptive markets.
* The company culture shifted from a focus on technological advancement to a focus on financial optimization.
* This led to a failure to capitalize on the mobile revolution, costing them a chance to dominate another era of computing. 



## Chapter 34: Running Faster?
