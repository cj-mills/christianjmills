## Overview

Here are some notes I took while watching Brian Bucklew's [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnFj3dOKcIQ) covering how to use the WaveFunctionCollapse algorithm to procedurally generate dungeon levels.


## WaveFunctionCollapse

- Developed by Maxim Gumin and released as open source in 2016
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse)
- [Caves of Qud](https://www.cavesofqud.com/) was the first commercial use, many others quickly followed.

## WaveFunctionCollapse Textures and Tiles

- WFC hast two primary modes of function, tile maps and textures
- The tilemap generation mode creates tile set solutions via propagation of defined tile adjacency constraints.
- Caves of Qud uses Texture Mode

### Texture Mode

- Easy training inputs (small (e.g. 16x16) training images that can be easily created in tools like mspaint)
- Powerful outputs (arbitrarily large output textures that are locally similar to the input)

### How it Works

1. The input texture is divided into $NxN$ (e.g. 3x3) subtextures (tiles) and their overlap with other tiles is calculated (e.g. overlap neighboring tiles by 1 on each side).
    - Can rotate and reflect the input texture to increase the number of available tiles
2. The output is initialized with each pixel being a full superposition of possible output tiles.
    - Imagine placing the stack of subtexture tiles on each pixel in the output image
    - The (3x3) tiles overlap at the edges
3. The lowest entropy $NxN$ (e.g. 3x3) area is selected from the output and one option is selected at random from the remaining possibilities.
    - Pick a random (or lowest entropy) pixel location in the output image
    - Pick a random tile from the stack for that pixel location
    - That final value for that pixel location in the output image is set to the value at the center of the (3x3) tile that was selected
    - All other potential tiles in the stack for that pixel location are discarded (***i.e.*** ***the stack collapses***)
4. New information based on that selection are propagated (***like a wave***) to adjacent areas, removing possibilities that won't properly overlap.
    - Remove the tiles from the stacks for the neighboring pixel locations that are not compatible with the selected tile for the finalized pixel location
    - Select the neighboring pixel location with the smallest remaining tile stack (***i.e. lowest entropy***)
    - Pick a random option from the remaining compatible tiles
    - Repeat for the neighboring tiles around that pixel location
5. If any elements are still uncollapsed go to step 2.
    - Select the pixel location with the smallest remaining tile stack

### Quick Code Example

```csharp
// Input: the training image
// N: How large of blocks NxN (e.g. 3x3) to sample from the input as input patterns.
// Note: Higher N leads to rising CPU and memory cost)
// Width: The output width
// Height: The output height
// periodicInput: Whether to sample the input across edges
// perdiodic: Whether the output should be sampled across edges to create edge-wrapping output
// symmetry: A value between 1..8, indicating how many reflection and rotation symmetries should be sampled from the input
var model = new OverlappingModel(input, N:3, width:48, height:48, periodicInput:true, periodic:false, symmetry:8, ground: 0);
model.Run(random.Next, limit:0);
model.Graphics().Save($"output.png");
```

Problem 0 - Scaling

- The execution time scales with the input resolution
- Memory usage scales with tile size

Problem 1 - Homogeneity

- The output just goes on forever in every direction
- There is no inherent large scale structure

Solution

- Perform a preprocess pass for map segmentation
    - Partition large scale chunks (shapes) whose interior walls are generated by WFC.
- Add additional details with subsequent passes
    - Fill in the chunks with different WFC pass using new input
    - Can use algorithms like A* to find broken connectivity (e.g. find places to put doors)

Problem 2 - Overfitting

- Adding more detail often results in overfitting small details, reducing the variability of the output

Solution:

- Use WFC to create overall architecture
- Create additional detail and connectivity (doors, etc) with follow-up passes
