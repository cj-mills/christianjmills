## Introduction

I decided to recreate this [short tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeH41Tz1zGI&list=PLGKIkAXk1OeTti1rRVTJF_9_JCC3zY0bh&index=27) from YouTube to practice using the Blender Python API. This post goes through the code I came up with to replicate the tutorial.

## Import Dependencies

The only dependencies strictly required for this tutorial are `bpy` and `bmesh`. The `bpy` package is the base API for Blender and the `bmesh` module provides access to Blender's internal mesh editing API. I also used the `math` module from the Python Standard Library for one of my helper functions. 

![import-dependencies](..\images\shape-key-motion-graphic-bpy\import-dependencies.png)



## Define Helper Functions

I made some wrapper functions for the standard location, rotation, and scale transformations as well as getting the name of the active object.

You can get the name of the active object with `bpy.context.active_object.name`.

The three standard transformations can be accessed for individual objects with the following:

* `bpy.data.objects["object_name"].location`
* `bpy.data.objects["object_name"].rotation_euler`
* `bpy.data.objects["object_name"].scale`

I also made a function to empty the default collection so that nothing gets duplicated. Collections can be accessed with `bpy.data.collections["collection_name"]` or `bpy.data.collections[index]`.

Lastly, I made a function to easily add sequences of keyframes to a given object. The function uses the built-in `setattr()` method to set the desired value for the target object and uses the `object.keyframe_insert()` method to add the keyframe. 

![define-helper-functions](..\images\shape-key-motion-graphic-bpy\define-helper-functions_2.png)



## Set up Scene

The first thing I do is set the Color Management property, View Transform, from the default value of `Filmic` to `Standard`. This setting can be accessed at `bpy.data.scenes["Scene"].view_settings.view_transform`.

This tutorial requires transparency to be enabled. This can be done by setting `bpy.data.scenes['Scene'].render.film_transparent` to `True`.

Next, I set the background to the desired color. In my case, it's pure black. The background color is stored in `bpy.data.worlds['World'].node_tree.nodes["Background"].inputs[0].default_value`.

The last setup step is to clear any objects added from the last time the script was run with the `clear_collection()` function.

## Create and Position Camera

Cameras can be added using the `bpy.ops.object.camera_add()` method. I then positioned the camera using the wrapper functions I defined earlier.

![create_camera](./images/create-camera.png)





## Create Material With Emission Shader

I decided to add some color to the motion graphic so I needed to create a new material. It is recommended to check if the material exists before trying to create it. This can be done in one line as shown below.

`material = bpy.data.materials.get(material_name) or bpy.data.materials.new(material_name)`

Since there's is no light, I'll add an `Emission` shader. This requires enabling nodes for the material with `material.use_nodes = True`. 

Next, I remove the default `Principled_BSDF` node as well as any `Emission` nodes from earlier runs. Nodes can be removed using the `material.node_tree.nodes.remove()` method.

The `Emission` node needs to be linked to the first slot in the `Material Output` node. Nodes are linked using the `material.node_tree.links.new()` method.

## Create a Cone With the Material

The motion graphic is made of two triangles with one being a duplicate of the other. The original triangle started off as a cone with `3` vertices. Cones can be added using the `bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cone_add()` method. 

I then assign the previously created material to the cone. Materials can be added to an object with `object.data.materials.append(material)`.

![create-cone](./images/create-cone.png)



## Turn the Cone Into a Triangle

The next step is to remove the tip of the cone. This requires modifying its mesh. Mesh data for the currently selected object is stored at `bpy.context.object.data`.

To edit the mesh, we need to get a BMesh representation. We first create an empty BMesh with `bm = bmesh.new()` and then fill it with the mesh using `bm.from_mesh(mesh)`.

We can delete vertices with the `bmesh.ops.delete()` and setting the `context` to `VERTS`. 

The mesh then needs to be updated with these alterations using `bm.to_mesh(mesh)`. We need to free the BMesh representation we created with `bm.free()`.

Finally, I reset the origin of the triangle with `bpy.ops.object.origin_set()`.

## Duplicate the Triangle

We can make the second triangle with `bpy.ops.object.duplicate()`.

![duplicate-triangle](./images/duplicate-triangle_2.png)



## Create the Holdout Material

We need to add a `Holdout` material to the second triangle so we can see through anything behind it. The process is the same as adding the `Emission` shader.

![create-holdout-material](./images/create-holdout-material.png)



## Add Keyframes

Before adding the keyframes, I set the render frame rate as well the start and end frames for the scene. The frame rate is stored at `bpy.context.scene.render.fps`.

The start and end frames are stored in `bpy.data.scenes['Scene'].frame_start` and `bpy.data.scenes['Scene'].frame_end` respectively.

### X-ray Triangle

We only need to animate the rotation and scale for the x-ray triangle.

## Conclusion

This tutorial did not require learning any new parts of the API after the last tutorial I [replicated](../shape-key-motion-graphic-bpy/). I guess in that sense, it was a waste of time. However, I still enjoyed working on it and I like the resulting motion graphic.
