<p>Chapter 16 challenges the notion that early specialization is key to success. It advocates for developing a broad base of knowledge, encouraging children to explore various areas to discover their unique value. The chapter draws on concepts from David Epstein’s book “Range,” emphasizing the benefits of generalization before specialization and exploring Naval Ravikant’s idea of specific knowledge—unique traits and skills that individuals can offer the world.</p>
