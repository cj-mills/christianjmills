## Overview

Here are some notes I took while watching Mayuko's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KObiuTFYTkM) on finding software engineering job openings.

**Note:** Finding a job takes time.



## Job Websites

- Companies tend to have a jobs place
- LinkedIn is really saturated with candidates
    - It's also expensive for companies to post jobs on there
- It is best to look where others are not
    - [AngelList](https://angel.co/)
      
    - [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/)
    
- It is recommended to find the job id listing on these sites and then go to the company's careers page and apply directly
    - Will have more specific information and questions that you need to fill out to apply
    - Makes the recruiter's life easier
- For jobs that really interest you, find the actual Hiring Manager for that job and reach out personally
    - Go on the companies website and search the list of employees
- Can also search LinkedIn using search terms "we're hiring" or "join our team"

## Referrals

- When a friend, colleague, or acquaintance refers or recommends you for a job
    - A more legitimate connection
- Referrals often get to "skip the line" of applications
- Still needs to go through the hiring manager
- Referrals carry a lot of weight
    - Make sure you ask the right person for a referral

## Recruitment Events

- Worth the time
- Recruiters and hiring managers put in a lot of effort into the events
    - Very concerned about ROI
- Be ready to present yourself
