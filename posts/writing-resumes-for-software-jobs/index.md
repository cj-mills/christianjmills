## Overview

The last time I was asked to send someone my resume, I did not even have a resume. Now, I don't know for sure that the quality of my hastily put together resume was the reason I did not here back, but I would not be surprised if it was. So, I decided to watch mayuko's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5gy9iqjwXM) where she covers some tips on writing resumes from an ex-FAANG recruiter. Below are some notes I took while watching.



## What Is a Resume

- a 1-page document that outlines your relevant skills, experience, and background for a specific role
- The first (and maybe only) thing that a company looks at when considering you for a role
- Often the one thing you really need to apply to a job
- **The goal of the resume is to get noticed by the recruiter**



## Resume Process

- (application â†’ interview)
- Upload and submit your full application
    - Includes resume at minimum
- Application is fed through an Application Tracking System
    - A tool companies use to track applicants and what stage they are at in the recruitment process
    - Applications in the ATS are sent to a recruited who filters through everything and pick who they think might be a good fit
- If the recruiter thinks your application is a good fit, they pass it along to the hiring manager
    - The hiring manager would be your manager if you got hired
    - Ultimately make the hiring decision



## Recruiter Thought Process

- Put yourself in the shoes of the recruiter
    - Think about all the factors the recruiter has to juggle in order to higher for that role
    - What skills are necessary to contribute effectively?
    - How experienced do they need to be?
- The job listing will often give clues as to what the recruiter is looking for
    - Skills needed
    - What tools are used
    - Years of experience
- It is really hard to capture into words exactly what the recruiter is looking for
    - Try to read between the lines of the job posting
    - What in the resume would give the recruiter a sign the you will succeed in this role
    - Can also look for clues based on the type of people already working there and the culture deck on the company website
- Is the job opening going to be competitive?
    - Will they need to sift through thousands of resumes?
    - Assume the early career and internship roles are going to receive a ton of applications
        - Lower requirements means more people are technically qualified for the role
    - High profile companies like FAANG or really popular startup will also receive a ton of applications
- What would the hiring manager think of your application?
    - The recruiter is trying to cater to the hiring manager



## How to Craft Your Resume

- The most important thing is readability
    - The resume needs to be structured logically and be super easy to ready
    - Always be 1-page

### Five Main Parts:

1. Contact Info
    - Keep it clean and simple
    - Name
    - Email address
    - City and State you live in
    - Link to your LinkedIn profile
    - tag line that briefly describes who you are
        - Example: Mayuko Inoue is an iOS Software Engineer with six years of experience.
        - Helps recruiters quickly identify what you do and how long you have been doing it.
2. Skills
    - Relevant to this job
    - Programming languages you are proficient in
        - Example: Python
    - Technologies you are skilled in
        - Example: Docker
    - Tools you are comfortable with
        - Example: Visual Studio Code
    - Write the skills in the order you are most comfortable
        - Litmus Test: can you do an interview with a given technology
        - Litmus Test: can you explain a given technology really well to someone else
        - Really important not to lie or stretch the truth about your experience
        - Recruiters will use this part of your resume to craft your interview
3. Experience
    - Projects or teams you have worked on that are ***relevant*** to this position
    - What role did you play for a given project
    - Was it a group project?
    - Add title to the project
        - Example: Lead Software Engine, Project Name
    - Start with power verb (an action word that has positive meaning) plus how you did it and what came out of the project.
        - Example: Implemented entire iOS app with SwiftUI and Firebase to create a delightful user experience for client to easily keep track of their grocery list.
    - For bullet points
        - Stay consistent
        - Example: if one section has three bullet points, make sure the other sections have 3-4
    - If you don't have real job experience
        - Add internships
        - Non-related projects you might have done at work that share intangibles
        - Relevant personal projects
4. Education
    - University
    - Degree
    - Graduation Year
5. Anything Else (optional)
    - Stuff you think would be pertinent to tell the recruiter that does not fit in the above sections
    - Things like exceptional awards or achievements
