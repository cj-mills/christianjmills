## Overview

I decided to watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsTzLgra5dQ) published by freeCodeCamp on business tips for freelance developers. Below are some notes I took while watching.



## Characteristics of a Freelance Developer

- Should be self-motivated
- Should not need structure provided for you
- Must be able to self-impose deadlines
- Must be able to handle distractions



## Standing Out From Other Freelance Developers

- You are not a developer, you are a ***problem solver***
- Phrase your capabilities in the context of the problem a potential client needs to be solved
- Do not use technical jargon
- Be an active listener
- Do not talk about your specific technical skills
- Talk about how you are able to address the client's needs



## How to Sell Your Services

### Initial Meeting

- Make sure you are in an appropriate venue
    - Example: Don't do sales calls while driving
    - Make sure you are in a location that you can take business calls during business hours
- Identify the potential client's problems
- Take time to understand the client's business
    - What do they do?
    - How do they normally operate?
    - What are their typical customers like?
    - What are their goals?
    - What are some unique characteristics?

### Proposal

- Incorporate the knowledge gained from the initial meeting into a proposal for their unique needs
- Spell out specifically what you are going to do in a contract

### Close

- Describe the features in your proposal and how they address the client's needs
- Describe the problems you identified
- Describe what you are going to do about those problems
- Describe how what you are going to do will address those problems



## Where to Sell Your Services

### Networking Events

- Go to networking events where the attendees are not other developers
    - Example: Networking events with small business owners from wide range of fields
    - It is easier to get clients when you are the only developer in the room
    - [Business Network International](https://www.bni.com/)
      - Do not rely on it as a single source of business.

### Third Party Services

**Pros**

- Lots of traffic

**Cons**

- Lower profits
- Have to pay to get the lead

### Personal Website

- Build website in a way that tells them you will listen to and address their specific needs
- Can promote through pay per click ads
    - Can get expensive
    - Avoid ad-word management services
