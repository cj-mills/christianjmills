## Part 1: Should You Be a Freelancer?

### Introduction

- **Luke Ciciliano**, a web developer, presents a four-part discussion on making money as a freelance developer.
- This discussion addresses the questions many face after completing coding programs like Free Code Camp: freelancing, getting a job, or starting a business.
- The discussion will cover four key areas:
    - Determining if freelancing is a good fit.
    - Making yourself stand out from other freelance developers.
    - How to sell your services effectively.
    - Where and how to sell your services.

### Should You Be a Freelance Developer?

- **Two key questions to consider:**
    - Is freelancing a good fit for your **personality**?
    - Can you **make money** doing it?
- **Personality Fit:**
    - **Self-Motivated vs. Structure-Oriented:**
        - Freelancers need to be **self-motivated** and **self-disciplined** as they are their own boss. 
        - They need to manage their time, filter distractions, and set deadlines.
        - Individuals who thrive in structured environments with clear directions and deadlines might be better suited for traditional employment.
    - **Working from Home:**
        - Freelancers often work from home, requiring the ability to manage distractions effectively.
    - **Self-Regulation:**
        - Freelancers need to be able to regulate their work schedule and ensure consistent productivity.
- **Earning Potential:**
    - **Large Market:**
        - A **$21.6 billion** market exists for freelance developers, based on the number of small businesses without websites or with outdated websites.
        - There are roughly **24 million** small businesses in the United States.
        - Roughly **30%** (7.2 million) of these businesses lack a quality website or have one that is drastically out of date (as of 2017).
        - Assuming a **$3,000** average website cost, the potential market size is **7.2 million x $3,000 = $21.6 billion**.
    - **Potential for Higher Earnings:**
        - This estimate is conservative as it only considers basic website development.
        - Freelancers can earn more by offering additional services like mobile app development or charging higher prices for complex projects.
- **Conclusion:**
    - Freelancing is suitable for **self-motivated individuals** with the ability to manage their time and work independently.
    - It offers significant **earning potential** with a large market of small businesses needing web development services.





## Part 2: How to Make Yourself Stand Out

### Introduction

- This section focuses on differentiating yourself from other freelance developers to build a successful business.
- It emphasizes the importance of understanding and addressing customer needs to stand out in a competitive market.

### The Disconnect Between Developers and Customers

- A significant disconnect exists between developers and potential customers (primarily small businesses).
- Many small businesses lack quality websites despite a large pool of developers.
- **Reason for the Disconnect:**
    - Developers often focus on technical skills and jargon rather than understanding and addressing customer needs.
    - **Example:** Developers might highlight their expertise in CMS, HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript, while small business owners are primarily concerned with solving business problems like online ordering, showcasing their business, or attracting new customers.
- **Bridging the Gap:**
    - **Become a Problem Solver:** Freelancers need to shift their mindset from being solely developers to becoming **problem solvers**.
    - **Understanding Customer Needs:** 
        - **Active Listening:** Engage in conversations to understand the specific needs and goals of the business.
        - **Example:** Instead of simply asking if a pizza shop needs online ordering, inquire about their dine-in vs. carry-out business, customer base, and overall business goals.
    - **Proposing Solutions:** Offer tailored solutions that address the identified problems.
        - **Example:** Suggest a photo gallery to showcase the dining experience, online ordering for college students, or a dedicated section for specials.
- **Benefits of Bridging the Gap:**
    - **Standing Out:** By focusing on problem-solving, you differentiate yourself from developers who primarily focus on technical skills.
    - **Tapping into the Market:** You can effectively connect with the large number of small businesses needing web development services.

### Conclusion

- Recognize the disconnect between developers and potential customers.
- Position yourself as a **problem solver** by actively listening to customer needs and proposing tailored solutions.
- This approach will help you stand out from the competition and build a successful freelance business.





## Part 3: How to Sell Your Services

### Introduction

- This section addresses the crucial aspect of selling your services as a freelance developer.
- It emphasizes the importance of **problem-solving** in the sales process.
- It acknowledges the discomfort some individuals may have with selling and encourages them to develop these skills.

### Overcoming Discomfort with Selling

- Many people feel uncomfortable with selling, especially when it involves self-promotion.
- **Two Key Points:**
    - **Sales Skills Can Be Developed:** Selling is a skill that can be learned and improved through practice and effort.
    - **Selling is Essential:** For freelance developers, selling is crucial for acquiring clients and generating income.

### The Sales Process

- The sales process typically involves three stages:
    - **Initial Meeting:**
        - **Purpose:** Use this meeting (often over the phone) to understand the potential client's business and identify their problems.
        - **Focus on Problem Identification:** Ask questions to understand the client's business model, target audience, goals, and challenges.
        - **Example:** Instead of a generic approach, ask specific questions about the pizza shop's dine-in business, customer demographics, and desired website features.
    - **Proposal:**
        - **Purpose:** Present a tailored solution that addresses the identified problems.
        - **Focus on Problem-Solving:** Explain how your proposed website features will address the client's specific needs.
        - **Clear and Concise Language:** Avoid technical jargon and ensure the proposal is easily understandable.
        - **Written Proposal:** Include a detailed scope of work to avoid misunderstandings later.
    - **Closing:**
        - **Purpose:** Secure the client's agreement to proceed with your proposed solution.
        - **Emphasize Problem-Solving:** Reiterate how your proposal solves the client's problems and addresses their business goals.
        - **Example:** Explain how the website's photo gallery will attract dine-in customers, how online ordering will cater to college students, and how a specials page will drive sales.

### Additional Tips

- **Appropriate Setting for Initial Meetings:** Ensure you are in a conducive environment for taking calls and conducting meaningful conversations. Avoid taking important calls while driving or in distracting settings.
- **Clear and Concise Communication:** Avoid technical jargon when communicating with clients. Explain concepts in a way they can easily understand.
- **Detailed Written Proposals:** Include a comprehensive scope of work in the written proposal to avoid disputes later on.

### Conclusion

- The key to effective selling is to **identify problems, propose solutions, and explain how those solutions address the client's needs.**
- By employing this problem-solving approach, you can significantly increase your chances of closing deals and building a successful freelance business.





## Part 4: Where to Sell Your Services

### Introduction

- This section explores various platforms and strategies for connecting with potential clients and selling your services.

### Three Main Sources for Finding Clients

- **Networking:**
    - **Traditional Networking Events:** While attending developer-focused events can be beneficial, it's more effective to network with potential clients directly.
    - **Target Business-Oriented Events:** Attend events where you can connect with small business owners from various industries.
    - **Business Network International (BNI):** BNI is a national organization with local chapters that offer exclusive spots for different professions. 
        - It facilitates referrals among members, expanding your network and potential client base.
        - Each chapter has only one representative from each profession, ensuring you're the sole developer in your chapter.
- **Third-Party Services:**
    - **Platforms like Fiverr and Thumbtack:** These platforms connect service providers with potential clients.
    - **Advantages:** High traffic and exposure to a large pool of potential clients.
    - **Disadvantages:** Lower profit margins due to competition and platform fees.
- **Your Own Website:**
    - **Create a Professional Website:** Build a website that showcases your expertise and emphasizes your problem-solving approach.
    - **Promote Your Website:** Utilize pay-per-click advertising (e.g., Google AdWords) to drive traffic to your website.
    - **Advantages:** Control over pricing and branding.
    - **Disadvantages:** Requires investment in website development and advertising.
    - **Avoid Pay-Per-Click Management Services:** Manage your own AdWords campaigns or leverage free resources like Google AdWords support and online tutorials.

### Conclusion

- Explore various options for finding clients, including networking, third-party platforms, and your own website.
- Consider the pros and cons of each approach and choose the strategy that best suits your needs and goals.
- When connecting with potential clients, utilize the selling techniques discussed in Part 3 to effectively demonstrate your value and close deals.
