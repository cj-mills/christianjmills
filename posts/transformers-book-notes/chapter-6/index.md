## Introduction

* Text summarization requires the model to understand long passages, reason about the contents, and produce fluent text that incorporates the main topics from the original document.



## Project: Summarize Dialogues Between Several People

* Text summarization requires the model to understand long passages, reason about the contents, and produce fluent text that incorporates the main topics from the original document.
* Text summarization is a classic sequence-to-sequence task with an input text and a target text.
* The goal is to build an encoder-decoder model to condense dialogues between several people into a crisp summary.



## The CNN/DailyMail Dataset

* The CNN/DailyMail dataset contains over 300,000 pairs of news articles and their corresponding summaries.
* The summaries are composed of the bullet points that CNN and The Daily Mail attach to their articles.
* The summaries are abstractive, consisting of new sentences instead of excerpts.
* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/abisee/cnn-dailymail)
* [Hugging Face Dataset Card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail)

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
```

------

**Load Version 3.0.0 of the CNN/DailMail dataset**

```python
dataset = load_dataset("cnn_dailymail", version="3.0.0")
print(f"Features: {dataset['train'].column_names}")
```
```text
    Features: ['article', 'highlights', 'id']
```

**Note:**

* The dataset has three columns.
    1. The `article` column contains the news articles.
    2. The `highlights` column contains the summaries.
    3. The `ids` column uniquely identifies each article.

------

**View an excerpt from an article**

```python
sample = dataset["train"][1]
article_len = len(sample["article"])
highlights_len = len(sample["highlights"])
print(f"""
Article (excerpt of 500 characters, total length: {article_len}):
""")
print(sample["article"][:500])
print(f'\nSummary (length: {highlights_len}):')
print(sample["highlights"])
print(f'\nThe article is {(article_len/highlights_len):.2f} times longer than the summary.')

The fastest man in the world charged clear of United States rival Justin Gatlin as the Jamaican quartet of Nesta Carter, Kemar Bailey-Cole, Nickel Ashmeade and Bolt won in 37.36 seconds.

    Summary (length: 180):
    Usain Bolt wins third gold of world championship .
    Anchors Jamaica to 4x100m relay victory .
    Eighth gold at the championships for Bolt .
    Jamaica double up in women's 4x100m relay .
    
    The article is 17.73 times longer than the summary.
```

**Note:** 
* Articles can be very long compared to the target summary.
* Long articles are challenging for most transformer models as their context size usually maxes out around 1,000 tokens.
    * A thousand tokens can contain a few paragraphs of text.
* The standard workaround to this limitation is to truncate the text to the model's context size.
    * This approach risks losing important information in the excluded portion of the text.

## Text Summarization Pipelines

**Get a 2,000 character excerpt from an article**

```python
sample_text = dataset["train"][1]["article"][:2000]
# We'll collect the generated summaries of each model in a dictionary
summaries = {}
```

**Note:** It is a convention in summarization to separate sentences by a newline.

------


```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize
```

------

#### The Natural Language Tookit (NLTK)

* [Homepage](https://www.nltk.org/)
* The toolkit provides easy-to-use interfaces and a suite of text processing libraries.


#### `sent_tokenize`
* [Documentation](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html?highlight=sent_tokenize#nltk.tokenize.sent_tokenize)
* Get a sentence-tokenized copy of a text.

### `nltk.tokenize.punkt`
* [Documentation](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.punkt.html?highlight=punkt#module-nltk.tokenize.punkt)
* The Punkt sentence tokenizer divides a text into a list of sentences. 
* An unsupervised algorithm builds a model of abbreviation words, collocations, and words that start sentences.

**Download the Punkt package**

```python
nltk.download("punkt")
```
```text
    [nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to /home/innom-dt/nltk_data...
    [nltk_data]   Package punkt is already up-to-date!

    True
```

------

**Test the sentence tokenizer**

```python
string = "The U.S. are a country. The U.N. is an organization."
sent_tokenize(string)
```
```text
    ['The U.S. are a country.', 'The U.N. is an organization.']
```

------

### Summarization Baseline

* A common baseline for summarizing news articles is to take the first three sentences of the article.

**Define a function to extract the first three sentences from a text**

```python
def three_sentence_summary(text):
    return "\n".join(sent_tokenize(text)[:3])
```

------

**Create a baseline summary**

```python
summaries["baseline"] = three_sentence_summary(sample_text)
```

**Set device number for Hugging Face Pipelines**

```python
import torch
```


```python
# 0 for the first CUDA GPU
# -1 for CPU
device_num = 0 if torch.cuda.is_available() else -1
```

------

### GPT-2

* We can use the GPT-2 model to generate summaries by appending "TL;DR" to the end of the input text.
* TL;DR indicates a short version of a long post.

------


```python
from transformers import pipeline, set_seed
```

The U.S finished second in 37.56 seconds with Canada taking the bronze after Britain were disqualified for a faulty handover. The 26-year-old Bolt has now collected eight gold medals at world championships, equaling the record held by American trio Carl Lewis, Michael Johnson and Allyson Felix, not to mention the small matter of six Olympic titles. The relay triumph followed individual successes in the 100 and 200 meters in the Russian capital. "I\'m proud of myself and I\'ll continue to work to dominate for as long as possible," Bolt said, having previously expressed his intention to carry on until the 2016 Rio Olympics. Victory was never seriously in doubt once he got the baton safely in hand from Ashmeade, while Gatlin and the United States third leg runner Rakieem Salaam had problems. Gatlin strayed out of his lane as he struggled to get full control of their baton and was never able to get on terms with Bolt. Earlier, Jamaica\'s women underlined their dominance in the sprint events by winning the 4x100m relay gold, anchored by Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who like Bolt was completing a triple. Their quartet recorded a championship record of 41.29 seconds, well clear of France, who crossed the line in second place in 42.73 seconds. Defending champions, the United States, were initially back in the bronze medal position after losing time on the second handover between Alexandria Anderson and English Gardner, but promoted to silver when France were subsequently disqualified for an illegal handover.

### PEGASUS

* [PEGASUS: Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08777)
* PEGASUS is an encoder-decoder transformer trained to predict masked sentences in multisentence tests.
* The authors argue that the pretraining objective is more effective the closer is to the downstream task.
* The authors trained PEGASUS to reconstruct sentences containing most of the content of their surrounding paragraphs in a large corpus.
* The model has dedicated tokens for newlines, so we do not need the sent_tokenize function.

**Note:**
* The summary generated by GPT-2 is quite different than the others.
* GPT-2 summarizes the characters instead of the text.
* The GPT-2 model often invents facts since it did not train to generate truthful summaries.
* There are significant similarities between the summaries generated by the T5, BART, and PEGASUS models.
* PEGASUS gets incredibly close to the ground truth summary.

## Measuring the Quality of Generated Text

* Conventional metrics like accuracy do not reflect the quality of the generated text.
* The field of text-generation is still looking for better evaluation metrics.
* The two most common metrics used to evaluate generated text are BLEU and ROUGE.
* Human judgment is still the best measure.

### Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU)
* [BLEU: a method for automatic evaluation of machine translation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.3115/1073083.1073135)
* BLEU is a precision-based metric where we count the number of words or n-grams in the generated text that occur in the reference text and divide it by the length of the reference.
* We only count a word as many times as it occurs in the reference text.
* BLEU is a popular metric for tasks like machine translation where precision takes priority. 
* Given one generated sentence, $snt$, that we to compare against a reference sentence, $snt^{\prime}$, we extract all possible n-grams of degree $n$ and do the accounting to get the precision $P_{n}$.
### $$P_{n} = \frac{\sum_{n-gram \ \in \ snt}{Count_{clip}(n-gram)}}{\sum_{n-gram \ \in \ snt^{\prime}}{Count(n-gram)}}$$
* We clip the occurrence count of an n-gram at how many times it appears in the reference sentence to avoid repetitive generations.
* We sum over all the examples in the corpus $C$.
### $$P_{n} = \frac{\sum_{snt \ \in \ C}\sum_{n-gram \ \in \ snt}{Count_{clip}(n-gram)}}{\sum_{snt^{\prime} \ \in \ C}\sum_{n-gram \ \in \ snt^{\prime}}{Count(n-gram)}}$$
* The precision score favors short sentences.
* The authors of BLEU introduce a brevity penalty to account for this.
### $$BR = min \left(1,e^{\frac{1 - \ell_{ref}}{\ell_{gen}}} \right)$$
* By taking the minimum, we ensure that this penalty never exceeds $1$, and the exponential term becomes exponentially small when the length of the generated text is smaller than the reference text.
* We don't use recall because it would incentivize translations that used all the words from all reference texts.
* The equation for the BLEU score:
### $$\text{BLEU-N} = BR \times \left( \prod^{N}_{n=1}{P_{n}} \right)^{\frac{1}{N}}$$
* The last term is the geometric mean of the modified precision up to n-gram $N$.
* The BLEU score does not account for synonyms and uses fragile heuristics.
* [Evaluating Text Output in NLP: BLEU at your own risk](https://towardsdatascience.com/evaluating-text-output-in-nlp-bleu-at-your-own-risk-e8609665a213)
    * This post provides an exposition of BLEU's flaws.
* The default BLEU metric expects tokenized text, leading to varying results for different tokenization methods.
* The SacreBLEU metric internalizes the tokenization step and is the preferred benchmarking metric.

**Note:**

* The bleu_metric object is an instance of the [Metric](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.0.0/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Metric) class and works as an aggregator.
* Add single instances with the `add()` method or whole batches via `add_batch()`.
* Call the `compute()` method to calculate the metric.

</div>
**Note:** 

* The precision of the 1-gram is 2/6 since the word "the" appears twice in the reference text.
* The BLEU score also works if there are multiple reference translations.
* BLEU integrates methods to modify the precision calculation to make the metric smoother for zero counts in the n-grams.

* [ROUGE: A Package for Automatic Evaluation of Summaries](https://aclanthology.org/W04-1013.pdf)
* The ROUGE score targets applications like summarization, where high recall is more important than precision alone.
* We check how many n-grams in the reference text also occur in the generated text.
### $$\text{ROUGE-N} = \frac{\sum_{snt^{\prime} \ \in \ C}\sum_{n-gram \ \in \ snt^{\prime}}{Count_{match}(n-gram)}}{\sum_{snt^{\prime} \ \in \ C}\sum_{n-gram \ \in \ snt^{\prime}}{Count(n-gram)}}$$
* There is a separate score to measure the longest common substring (LCS) called ROUGE-L.
* We can calculate the LCS for any pair of strings.
* We need to normalize the LCS value when comparing two samples of different lengths.
### $$F_{LCS} = \frac{\left( 1 + \beta^{2} \right)R_{LCS}P_{LCS}}{R_{LCS} + \beta P_{LCS}} \text{, where } \beta = \frac{P_{LCS}}{R_{LCS}}$$
* The Hugging Face Datasets implementation calculates two variants of ROUGE.
* ROUGE-L calculates the score per sentence and averages it for the summaries.
* ROUGE-Lsum calculates the score per sentence directly over the whole summary.

**Note:**

* The ROUGE metric in the Hugging Face Datasets library also calculates confidence intervals.
    * We can access the average value in the `mid` attribute and the interval with the `low` and `high`.
* GPT-2 is the only model not explicitly trained to summarize, and it performs the worst.
* The first-three-sentence baseline performs better than the GPT-2 model.
* PEGASUS performs the best by a wide margin.

## Training a Summarization Model

### The SAMSum Dataset
* [Hugging Face Dataset Card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/samsum)
* The SAMSum dataset contains about 16k messenger-like conversations with summaries.
* These dialogues could represent the interactions between a customer and the support center in an enterprise setting.
    * Generating accurate summaries can help improve customer service and detect common patterns among customer requests.

**Load the SAMSum dataset**
```python
dataset_samsum = load_dataset("samsum")
split_lengths = [len(dataset_samsum[split])for split in dataset_samsum]
```

------

**View sample from dataset**

```python
print(f"Split lengths: {split_lengths}")
print(f"Features: {dataset_samsum['train'].column_names}")
print("\nDialogue:")
print(dataset_samsum["test"][0]["dialogue"])
print("\nSummary:")
print(dataset_samsum["test"][0]["summary"])
```
```text
    Split lengths: [14732, 819, 818]
    Features: ['id', 'dialogue', 'summary']
    
    Dialogue:
    Hannah: Hey, do you have Betty's number?
    Amanda: Lemme check
    Hannah: <file_gif>
    Amanda: Sorry, can't find it.
    Amanda: Ask Larry
    Amanda: He called her last time we were at the park together
    Hannah: I don't know him well
    Hannah: <file_gif>
    Amanda: Don't be shy, he's very nice
    Hannah: If you say so..
    Hannah: I'd rather you texted him
    Amanda: Just text him 🙂
    Hannah: Urgh.. Alright
    Hannah: Bye
    Amanda: Bye bye
    
    Summary:
    Hannah needs Betty's number but Amanda doesn't have it. She needs to contact Larry.
```

**Note:** The dialogues resemble a typical chat application, including emojis and placeholders for GIFs.

### Evaluating PEGASUS on SAMSum

**Free unoccupied cached memory**
```python
model = None
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

------

**Reset random seed**

```python
set_seed(42)
```

------

**Create a text generation pipeline with the PEGASUS model**

```python
pipe = pipeline("summarization", model="google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail", device=device_num)
```

------


```python
pipe_out = pipe(dataset_samsum["test"][0]["dialogue"])
print("Summary:")
print(pipe_out[0]["summary_text"].replace(" .<n>", ".\n"))
```
```text
    Summary:
    Amanda: Ask Larry Amanda: He called her last time we were at the park together.
    Hannah: I'd rather you texted him.
    Amanda: Just text him .
```

**Note:** 
* The model tries to summarize by extracting the key sentences from the dialogue.
* The summaries in SAMSum are more abstract.

------

**Reset random seed**

```python
set_seed(42)
```

------

**Free unoccupied cached memory**

```python
pipe = None
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

------

**Load a pretrained PEGASUS model for sequence-to-sequence tasks**

```python
model_ckpt = "google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_ckpt)
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_ckpt).to(device)
```

------

**Run the full ROUGE evaluation on the test set**

```python
score = evaluate_summaries_pegasus(dataset_samsum["test"], rouge_metric, model,
                                   tokenizer, column_text="dialogue",
                                   column_summary="summary", batch_size=8)

rouge_dict = dict((rn, score[rn].mid.fmeasure) for rn in rouge_names)
pd.DataFrame(rouge_dict, index=["pegasus"])
```

<div style="overflow-x:auto;">
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>rouge1</th>
      <th>rouge2</th>
      <th>rougeL</th>
      <th>rougeLsum</th>
    </tr>

      <td>0.229237</td>
      <td>0.229642</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>
**Note:** The results are not great since the SAMSum dataset is quite different from the CNN/DailyMail dataset.

------

### Fine-Tuning PEGASUS

**Examine the length distribution of the input and output**

```python
d_len = [len(tokenizer.encode(s)) for s in dataset_samsum["train"]["dialogue"]]
s_len = [len(tokenizer.encode(s)) for s in dataset_samsum["train"]["summary"]]

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 3.5), sharey=True)
axes[0].hist(d_len, bins=20, color="C0", edgecolor="C0")
axes[0].set_title("Dialogue Token Length")
axes[0].set_xlabel("Length")
axes[0].set_ylabel("Count")
axes[1].hist(s_len, bins=20, color="C0", edgecolor="C0")
axes[1].set_title("Summary Token Length")
axes[1].set_xlabel("Length")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
![png](./images/output_144_0.png)


**Note:**
* Most dialogues are shorter than the CNN/DailyMail articles, with 100-200 tokens per dialogue.
* The summaries are also much short, with around 20-40 tokens.

------

**Define a function to tokenize the SAMSum dataset**

```python
def convert_examples_to_features(example_batch):
    input_encodings = tokenizer(example_batch["dialogue"], max_length=1024,
                                truncation=True)
    # Temporarily set the tokenizer for the decoder
    with tokenizer.as_target_tokenizer():
        target_encodings = tokenizer(example_batch["summary"], max_length=128,
                                     truncation=True)
    
    return {"input_ids": input_encodings["input_ids"],
            "attention_mask": input_encodings["attention_mask"],
            "labels": target_encodings["input_ids"]}
```

**Note:** Some models require special tokens in the decoder inputs.

------

**Tokenize the dataset**

```python
dataset_samsum_pt = dataset_samsum.map(convert_examples_to_features, 
                                       batched=True)
columns = ["input_ids", "labels", "attention_mask"]
dataset_samsum_pt.set_format(type="torch", columns=columns)
```

------

**Create a data collator**

* The Trainer object calls a data collator before feeding the batch through the model.
* The data collator for summarization tasks needs to stack the inputs and prepare the targets for the decoder.
* It is common to apply teacher forcing in the decoder in a sequence-to-sequence setup.
    * Teacher forcing involves feeding the decoder input tokens that consist of the labels shifted by one in addition to * the encoder output.
    * The decoder gets the ground truth shifted by one as input when making predictions.
    * We shift by one, so the decoder only sees the previous ground truth labels and not the current or future ones.
    * The decoder already has masked self-attention that masks all inputs at present and in the future.



**Visualize shifting the decoder input by one**

```python
text = ['PAD','Transformers', 'are', 'awesome', 'for', 'text', 'summarization']
rows = []
for i in range(len(text)-1):
    rows.append({'step': i+1, 'decoder_input': text[:i+1], 'label': text[i+1]})
pd.DataFrame(rows).set_index('step')
```

**Initialize the data collator**

```python
seq2seq_data_collator = DataCollatorForSeq2Seq(tokenizer, model=model)
```


```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer
```

------

**Prepare training arguments**

```python
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='pegasus-samsum', num_train_epochs=1, warmup_steps=500,
    per_device_train_batch_size=1, per_device_eval_batch_size=1,
    weight_decay=0.01, logging_steps=10, push_to_hub=True,
    evaluation_strategy='steps', eval_steps=500, save_steps=1e6,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=16, fp16=True)
```

    The default value for the training argument `--report_to` will change in v5 (from all installed integrations to none). In v5, you will need to use `--report_to all` to get the same behavior as now. You should start updating your code and make this info disappear :-).

**Free unoccupied cached memory**

```python
pipe = None
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

------

**Initialize the Trainer object**

```python
trainer = Trainer(model=model, args=training_args,
                  tokenizer=tokenizer, data_collator=seq2seq_data_collator,
                  train_dataset=dataset_samsum_pt["train"], 
                  eval_dataset=dataset_samsum_pt["validation"])
```

------

**Note:** Had to add the following workaround.

```python
old_collator = trainer.data_collator
trainer.data_collator = lambda data: dict(old_collator(data))
```

------

**Run the training loop and evaluate the trained model**

```python
trainer.train()
score = evaluate_summaries_pegasus(
    dataset_samsum["test"], rouge_metric, trainer.model, tokenizer,
    batch_size=2, column_text="dialogue", column_summary="summary")

rouge_dict = dict((rn, score[rn].mid.fmeasure) for rn in rouge_names)
```
```text

### Generating Dialogue Summaries


```python
gen_kwargs = {"length_penalty": 0.8, "num_beams":8, "max_length": 128}
sample_text = dataset_samsum["test"][0]["dialogue"]
reference = dataset_samsum["test"][0]["summary"]
# Set up a pipeline with the uploaded model
pipe = pipeline("summarization", model="cj-mills/pegasus-samsum")

print("Dialogue:")
print(sample_text)
print("\nReference Summary:")
print(reference)
print("\nModel Summary:")
print(pipe(sample_text, **gen_kwargs)[0]["summary_text"])
```
```text
    Dialogue:
    Hannah: Hey, do you have Betty's number?
    Amanda: Lemme check
    Hannah: <file_gif>
    Amanda: Sorry, can't find it.
    Amanda: Ask Larry
    Amanda: He called her last time we were at the park together
    Hannah: I don't know him well
    Hannah: <file_gif>
    Amanda: Don't be shy, he's very nice
    Hannah: If you say so..
    Hannah: I'd rather you texted him
    Amanda: Just text him 🙂
    Hannah: Urgh.. Alright
    Hannah: Bye
    Amanda: Bye bye
    
    Reference Summary:
    Hannah needs Betty's number but Amanda doesn't have it. She needs to contact Larry.
    
    Model Summary:
    Amanda can't find Betty's number. Larry called Betty the last time they were at the park together. Hannah wants Amanda to text him instead.
```

**Note:** The model learned to synthesize the dialogue into a summary without extracting existing passages.

------

**Test the fine-tuned model on custom input**

```python
custom_dialogue = """\
Thom: Hi guys, have you heard of transformers?
Lewis: Yes, I used them recently!
Leandro: Indeed, there is a great library by Hugging Face.
Thom: I know, I helped build it ;)
Lewis: Cool, maybe we should write a book about it. What do you think?
Leandro: Great idea, how hard can it be?!
Thom: I am in!
Lewis: Awesome, let's do it together!
"""
print(pipe(custom_dialogue, **gen_kwargs)[0]["summary_text"])
```
```text
    Thom, Lewis and Leandro are going to write a book about transformers. Thom helped build a library by Hugging Face. They are going to do it together.
```

**Note:** The model generated a coherent summary and synthesized the third and fourth lines into a logical combination.

## Conclusion

* It is still an open question regarding the best way to summarize texts longer than the model's content size.
* [Recursively Summarizing Books with Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10862)
    * OpenAI scaled summarization by applying the model recursively to long documents and using human feedback.
