## Introduction

* Transformer-based language models like GPT-2 and GPT-3 can generate text almost indistinguishable from text written by humans.
* Such models acquire a broad set of skills and pattern recognition abilities by learning to predict the next word in the text of millions of web pages.
* We can activate these skills with different kinds of input prompts.
* Language models are exposed to sequences of tasks during pretraining that we can adapt during inference.



## The Challenge with Generating Coherent Text

* Converting a model's probabilistic output to text requires a decoding method.
* The decoding process is iterative and involves significantly more computing than passing inputs once through the forward pass of a model.
* The quality and diversity of the generated text depend on the choice of decoding method and associated hyperparameters.

### GPT-2 Pretraining Process
* GPT-2 is pretrained to estimate the probability $P\left(y \vert x \right)$ of a sequence of tokens $y = y_{1},y_{2},\ldots,y_{t}$ occurring in the text $x = x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{k}$, given some initial prompt or context sequence.
* It is common to use the chain rule of probability to factorize it as a product of conditional probabilities.
### $$P\left(y_{1},\ldots,y_{t} \vert x \right) = \prod^{N}_{t=1}{P\left(y_{t} \vert y_{ \ < \ t},x \right)}$$
    * where $y_{ \ < \ t}$ is the shorthand notation for the sequence $y_{1},\ldots,y_{t-1}$
* We can adapt this token prediction task to generate sequences of arbitrary length by feeding the model a prompt. 
* We then iteratively add the next predicted token to the prompt and feed the new prompt to the model.
* Some call this type of text generation conditional text generation since the output sequence depends on the choice of input prompt.

### Decoding
* A decoding method determines which token to select at each timestep.
* The language model produces a logit $z_{t,i}$ per token in the vocabulary at each time step.
* We can get the probability distribution over the next possible token $w_{i}$ by taking the softmax.
### $$P\left(y_{t} = w_{i} \vert y_{ \ < \ t},x \right) = softmax \left( z_{t,i} \right)$$
* Most decoder methods search for the most likely overall sequence by picking a $\hat{y}$ such that
### $$\hat{y} = \underset{y}{argmax} P\left(y \vert x \right)$$
* We use approximations for $\hat{y}$ instead of finding it directly.



## Greedy Search Decoding

* The simplest decoding method is to greedily select the token with the highest probability at each timestep.
### $$\hat{y}_{t} = \underset{y}{argmax} {P\left(y_{t} \vert y_{ \ < \ t},x \right)}$$
* Greedy search decoding tends to produce repetitive output sequences.
* Greedy search can miss sequences whose overall probability is higher when low probability words precede high-probability words.
* Greedy search is not suitable for text generation tasks that require diversity. 
* Greedy search is better suited for producing short sequences like arithmetic that require deterministic and factually correct output.

**Note:** The results demonstrate the repetitive output that is characteristic of greedy search decoding.



## Beam Search Decoding

* Beam search keeps track of the $top-b$ most probable next tokens, where $b$ is the number of beams or partial hypotheses.
* There is a tradeoff between output quality and speed when choosing the number of beams.
* We choose the next set of beams by considering all possible next-token extensions of the existing ones and selecting the $b$ most likely extensions.
* We repeat this process until we reach the maximum length or an EOS token.
* We select the most likely sequence by ranking the $b$ beams according to their log probabilities.
### $$\log{P\left(y_{1},\ldots,y_{t} \vert x \right)} = \sum^{N}_{t=1}{\log{P\left(y_{t} \vert y_{ \ < \ t},x \right)}}$$

-----

**Note:** We use the log probabilities to avoid numerical instability due to floating-point precision.

-----

**Define a function to calculate the log probability of a single token**
```python
def log_probs_from_logits(logits, labels):
    # Normalize the logits with softmax before taking the log
    logp = F.log_softmax(logits, dim=-1)
    logp_label = torch.gather(logp, 2, labels.unsqueeze(2)).squeeze(-1)
    return logp_label
```

-----

**Define a function to calculate the log probabilities of a sequence**
```python
def sequence_logprob(model, labels, input_len=0):
    with torch.no_grad():
        output = model(labels)
        log_probs = log_probs_from_logits(
            # We dont need the last logit since we don't have a ground truth token for it
            # We don't have a logit for the first token
            output.logits[:, :-1, :], labels[:, 1:])
        # Sum the log probabilities for each token
        # Ignore the log probabilities of the input sequence
        seq_log_prob = torch.sum(log_probs[:, input_len:])

**Note:**
* A higher log probability is better.

                             do_sample=False, no_repeat_ngram_size=2)

    log-prob: -93.12
```

**Note:**
* There are no repetitions, and the text remains coherent despite a lower log probability.
* We can use beam search with an n-gram penalty to find a tradeoff between focusing on high-probability tokens while reducing repetitions.

-----



## Sampling Methods

* The simplest sampling method is to randomly sample from the probability distribution of the model's outputs over the entire vocabulary at each timestep.
### $$P\left(y_{t} = w_{i} \vert y_{ \ < \ t},x \right) = \text{softmax} \left( z_{t,i} \right) = \frac{\exp(z_{t,i})}{ \sum^{|V|}_{j=1} \exp(z_{t,j})}$$
* where $\vert V \vert$ denotes the cardinality of the vocabulary
* We can control the diversity of the output by adding a temperature parameter $T$ that rescales the logits before taking the softmax.
### $$\left(y_{t} = w_{i} \vert y_{ \ < \ t},x \right) = \text{softmax} \left( z_{t,i} \right) = \frac{\frac{\exp(z_{t,i})}{T}}{ \sum^{|V|}_{j=1} \frac{\exp(z_{t,j}}{T})}$$
* We can tune the temperature parameter to control the shape of the probability distribution.
* A $T$ value much less than $1$ suppresses the rare tokens.
* A $T$ value much greater than $1$ causes each token to become equally likely.

**Note:**
* The histogram has a peak around 10^-8 and a second smaller peak around 10^-4, followed by a sharp drop.
* The probability of picking the token with the highest likelihood is 1 in 10.
* There are 50,257 tokens in GPT-2's vocabulary.
* The curved line in the Cumulative probability chart represents the probability of picking any of the preceding tokens.
* There is a 1 in 100 chance of not picking any of the tokens that are not n the top 2000.
* There is a significant chance of picking an unlikely token when sampling hundreds of times.
* Picking such tokens can negatively impact the quality of the generated text.

### Top-k Sampling
* The idea behind top-k sampling is to avoid low-probability choices by only choosing from the k tokens with the highest probability.
* We can find a good value for k by looking at some text quality metrics.

**Generate text using the 50 tokens with the highest probability** 
```python
output_topk = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=max_length, do_sample=True, 
                             top_k=50)
print(tokenizer.decode(output_topk[0]))

    In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.

​    
    The researchers came across about 50 of the animals in the valley. They had lived in such a remote and isolated area at that location for nearly a thousand years that


### Nucleus (top-p) Sampling
* The idea behind nucleus sampling is to cut off the long tail of the distribution after reaching a certain probability mass in the selection.
* We order all tokens in descending order by probability and add one token after another from the top of the list until the sum of the probabilities of the selected tokens reaches the target mass.

## Which Decoding Method Is Best?

* The best approach depends on the nature of the task.
* Lower the temperature or use deterministic methods to perform a precise task like arithmetic or providing an answer to a specific question.
* Switch to sampling methods and increase the temperature when you want the model to generate longer text and be more creative.
