<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-inside-joke">An Inside Joke</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The term “atomic,”</strong> while outdated in the context of nuclear technology, persists due to its historical charm and literary origins.</li>
<li><strong>Frederick Soddy’s 1909 book, “Interpretation of Radium,”</strong> detailed the discovery of energetic rays emitted during the disintegration of radium.
<ul>
<li>Soddy and Rutherford confirmed the existence of these rays.</li>
<li>Marie Curie, the discoverer of radium, named this energy “radiation.”</li>
<li>Rutherford jokingly suggested the possibility of triggering a chain reaction of disintegration in a radioactive metal, causing a massive explosion.</li>
<li>Soddy dismissed the idea as fantasy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>H.G. Wells’ 1914 novel, “The World Set Free,”</strong> was inspired by Soddy’s book.
<ul>
<li>Wells, a renowned science fiction author known for works like “The Time Machine” and “The War of the Worlds,” envisioned a future world war involving powerful bombs.</li>
<li>These bombs, dubbed <strong>“atomic bombs,”</strong> utilized radioactive decay as their explosive mechanism and could destroy entire cities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Wells’ description of the atomic bomb’s technology was fictional and nonsensical:</strong>
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Those used by the Allies were lumps of pure carolinum, painted on the outside with unoxidized sidenator-inducive enclosed hermetically in a case of membranium, A little celluloid stud between the handles by which the bomb was lifted was arranged so as to be easily torn off and admit air to the inducive, which at once became active and set up radioactivity in the outer layer of the Carolinum sphere. This liberated fresh inducive, and in a few minutes the whole bomb was a blazing continual explosive.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Despite the inaccurate science, the book gained popularity among some technologists and nuclear scientists.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Wells accurately predicted that artificially induced radioactivity would be achieved by 1933.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Leo Szilard, a Hungarian physicist, read Wells’ book in 1932 and was inspired to explore nuclear chain reactions.</strong>
<ul>
<li>He solved the problem of self-sustained nuclear fission in 1933 and filed a patent for the nuclear reactor in 1934.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>By World War II, the term “atomic” had become scientifically outdated.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Rutherford’s discovery of the nucleus in 1911 revealed that radiation originated from nuclear decay, not atomic processes.</li>
<li><strong>Atomic processes,</strong> such as chemical reactions, involve the electron clouds surrounding the nucleus, while <strong>nuclear binding forces</strong> are the source of radiation and a far greater energy source.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>During the secretive wartime nuclear research, descriptive terms were avoided in favor of code names.</strong>
<ul>
<li>The test bomb in New Mexico was called “the Gadget.”</li>
<li>The Hiroshima bomb was “Little Boy,” and the Nagasaki bomb was “Fat Man.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The term “Atomic Bomb” was adopted for the wartime nuclear weapons as a nod to H.G. Wells’ fictional creation, becoming an inside joke.</strong></li>
<li><strong>After the war, the term “atomic bomb” entered the public domain, popularized by the revelation of the Manhattan Project.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The United States Congress established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in 1946, officially adopting the outdated term.</strong>
<ul>
<li>The AEC was replaced by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1974.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The term “atomic” persists in the names of several international organizations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Japanese Atomic Energy Commission</li>
<li>Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission</li>
<li>Atomic Energy Commission of India</li>
<li>Commissariat à l’énergie atomique of France</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose of the book:</strong> Not to promote nuclear power, but to provide a clear history and understanding of its development and inevitability.</li>
<li><strong>Early perceptions of nuclear energy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sparked by a perceived energy crisis in 1939.</li>
<li>Douglas W. F. Meyer’s article “Energy from Matter” in <em>Discovery</em> magazine highlighted the potential of atomic power while acknowledging its limitations and dangers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>World War II and the Atomic Bomb:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Research on atomic energy shifted to military applications during World War II.</li>
<li>Public discussion of atomic energy ceased, replaced by a veil of secrecy.</li>
<li>The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 introduced the public to the destructive power of nuclear energy.</li>
<li>The subsequent publication of “Atomic Energy for Military Purposes” by Henry DeWolf Smith reignited public interest in the potential of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Post-War Optimism and the Nuclear Paradox:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The post-war era saw widespread optimism about the potential of nuclear power to provide clean, abundant, and inexpensive energy.</li>
<li>Louis L. Strauss, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), famously predicted “electrical energy too cheap to meter.”</li>
<li>However, this optimism was tempered by the inherent dangers associated with nuclear technology, exemplified by the destructive power of the atomic bomb.</li>
<li><strong>The nuclear paradox:</strong> The promise of a clean and abundant energy source juxtaposed with the potential for catastrophic destruction and long-term health risks.</li>

<section id="the-challenges-of-nuclear-power-development" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-challenges-of-nuclear-power-development">The Challenges of Nuclear Power Development</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Perception and Fear:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The association of nuclear power with nuclear weapons created a significant public relations challenge.</li>
<li>The development of increasingly powerful nuclear weapons, along with Cold War anxieties, fueled public fear and skepticism.</li>
<li>Government efforts to educate the public about the safety of nuclear power were often met with distrust.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The AEC’s Conflicting Roles:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The AEC was tasked with promoting civilian nuclear power while simultaneously managing the nuclear arsenal and downplaying potential risks.</li>
<li>This led to a lack of transparency and eroded public trust.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Economic Realities:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The high upfront capital costs of building nuclear power plants proved to be a major obstacle to expansion.</li>
<li>Nuclear power was ultimately more expensive than traditional fossil fuels, despite lower fuel costs.</li>
<li><strong>Economic factors, not public fear, were the primary reason for the halt in nuclear power expansion in the 1970s.</strong></li>
</ul></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-decline-of-nuclear-power-in-the-united-states">The Decline of Nuclear Power in the United States</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Three Mile Island Accident (1979):</strong>
<ul>
<li>A partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island Unit 2 reactor in Pennsylvania further damaged public confidence in nuclear power.</li>
<li>While not a catastrophic event, it highlighted the potential for accidents and the challenges of managing nuclear technology.</li>
<li><strong>The accident was a symptom of the decline, not the cause.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Chernobyl Disaster (1986):</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union, a catastrophic nuclear accident, solidified public anxieties about nuclear power safety.</li>
<li>The accident had a limited impact on the US nuclear industry, which was already in decline.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Nuclear Power in a Coma:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Following the economic challenges and public backlash, nuclear power expansion in the United States stalled.</li>
<li>New plant construction ceased, research and development slowed, and the nuclear industry entered a period of stagnation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Changing Energy Landscape:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The continued reliance on fossil fuels has led to increasing concerns about climate change, air pollution, and energy security.</li>
<li>The need for clean and sustainable energy sources has become increasingly urgent.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Nuclear Power as a Necessity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nuclear power is now recognized as a crucial component of a diversified energy portfolio.</li>
<li>Its ability to provide reliable, baseload power without greenhouse gas emissions makes it an essential part of the transition to a sustainable energy future.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Nuclear Awakening:</strong>
<ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Role of Skepticism and Openness in Scientific Discovery:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Scientific progress requires both rigorous skepticism and a willingness to consider new ideas, even those that challenge established paradigms.</li>
<li>The discovery of radioactivity, a phenomenon initially considered “supernatural,” revolutionized physics and paved the way for the development of nuclear technology.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Examples of Scientific Visionaries:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Isaac Newton, despite his groundbreaking contributions to physics, also explored spiritualism and the occult.</li>
<li>Albert Einstein, renowned for his theories of relativity, dedicated his later years to the pursuit of a unified field theory, a highly abstract and speculative endeavor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Power of Imagination in Science:</strong>

<li>In France, <strong>uranium tetrafluoride (yellow cake)</strong> is processed and enriched for use in nuclear power plants.</li>
<li><strong>Eurodif</strong>, a subsidiary of Kojima, operates a large <strong>gaseous diffusion plant</strong> to enrich uranium.</li>
<li>The plant enriches uranium from 0.7202% <strong>U-235</strong> (the fissile isotope) to 20.0% U-235.</li>
<li>In May 1972, an alarm was triggered at the Pierre-Lotte facility due to a <strong>U-235 deficit</strong> in a batch of uranium hexafluoride.</li>
<li>The U-235 concentration was only 0.7171%, significantly lower than the expected 0.7202%.</li>
<li>An investigation by the <strong>Commissariat à l’énergie atomique (CEA)</strong> traced the deficit back to the <strong>Oklo mine in Gabon, Africa</strong>.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Francis Perrin</strong>, a French physicist, was tasked with investigating the missing U-235.</li>
<li><strong>All uranium on Earth is the same age</strong> and originates from the supernova explosion of a star billions of years ago.</li>
<li>Uranium is <strong>unstable</strong> and decays into thorium and eventually lead over millions of years.</li>
<li><strong>U-235 decays faster than U-238</strong>, leading to a gradual decrease in the concentration of U-235 over time.</li>
<li>The expected U-235 concentration in 1972 should have been precisely 0.7202% in all uranium mines.</li>
<li>The investigation ruled out theft or processing errors as the cause of the deficit.</li>
<li>The only explanation for the missing U-235 was that it had undergone <strong>nuclear fission</strong> in a natural reactor.</li>
<li>Analysis of the Oklo samples confirmed the presence of <strong>stable fission products</strong> trapped in the rock formations.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>16 natural nuclear reactors</strong> were discovered at three locations within the Oklo mines.</li>
<li>The CEA announced the discovery of self-sustaining nuclear chain reactions at Oklo on <strong>September 25, 1972</strong>.</li>
<li>The reactors operated about <strong>1.5 billion years ago</strong>.</li>
<li>At that time, the natural uranium at Oklo had a U-235 concentration of <strong>3%</strong>, similar to the enriched uranium used in some modern reactors.</li>
<li><strong>Groundwater</strong> leaking into the uranium deposit acted as a <strong>moderator</strong>, slowing down neutrons and initiating the chain reaction.</li>
<li>The reactors operated in <strong>pulse mode</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Water heated up and boiled away, shutting down the reaction.</li>
<li>The reactors cooled down, allowing water to seep back in and restart the cycle.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The operating interval was approximately <strong>two hours and thirty minutes</strong>.</li>
<li>The reactors operated for a few hundred thousand years.</li>
<li>They produced heat at a rate of <strong>100 kilowatts</strong>, generated <strong>11,907 pounds of radioactive waste</strong>, and <strong>3,307 pounds of plutonium</strong>.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="early-theories-of-matter">Early Theories of Matter</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ancient Theories:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Four Elements Theory:</strong> The belief that everything is composed of earth, air, fire, and water.
<ul>
<li>Examples: Mud (earth and water), bricks (heated mud, water driven off), steam (water and air heated by fire).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Atomic Theory in India (550 BCE):</strong> Nyaya and Vaisheshika schools described elementary particles combining in pairs and trios to form complex materials.</li>
<li><strong>Greek Atomic Theory (430 BCE):</strong> Leucippus and Democritus proposed that matter is made of indivisible particles called <strong>atoms</strong> (“uncuttable”).
<ul>
<li>These theories lacked experimental evidence and were considered philosophical.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Practical Chemistry:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ancient industries (soap making, tool production) required empirical knowledge of chemical combinations and metal alloys.</li>
<li>Limitations of the four-element theory became evident due to the lack of a systematic method of analysis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Alchemy (Spagyric Art):</strong>
<ul>
<li>A 2,500-year-old practice focused on transmuting base metals into gold.</li>
<li><strong>Three Elements:</strong> Alchemists believed in three elements: salt, sulfur, and mercury.</li>
<li><strong>Contributions:</strong> Advanced distillation techniques, discovery of acids and bases.</li>
<li><strong>Influence:</strong> Despite its mystical nature, alchemy contributed to the development of chemistry and metallurgy.</li>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="j.j.-thompsons-background-and-career">J.J. Thompson’s Background and Career</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sir Joseph John J.J. Thompson (born 1856)</strong> was a British physicist at the Cavendish Laboratory in England.</li>
<li>Thompson’s parents encouraged him to pursue engineering.
<ul>
<li>He enrolled in an apprenticeship but, due to a waiting list, <strong>joined Owens College in Manchester at age 14</strong>.</li>
<li>He later <strong>transferred to Trinity College in Cambridge</strong>, graduating with a B.A. in mathematics in 1880 and an M.A.&nbsp;in mathematical physics in 1883.</li>
<li>He became <strong>Cavendish Professor of Physics in 1884</strong> and married Rose Paget in 1890.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Thompson focused on investigating cathode rays</strong>, a popular area of research involving vacuum tubes and high-voltage coils.
<ul>
<li><strong>Cathode rays were streams of energy observed in vacuum tubes when high voltage was applied across electrodes.</strong></li>
<li>Wilhelm Röntgen had used cathode rays to produce X-rays, but their nature remained a mystery.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="thompsons-cathode-ray-experiments" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thompsons-cathode-ray-experiments">Thompson’s Cathode Ray Experiments</h5>
<ul>
<li>Thompson conducted <strong>three sequential experiments to determine the nature of cathode rays.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experiment 1:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To determine if the negative charge associated with cathode rays could be separated from the rays themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Setup:</strong> A specialized vacuum tube with a cathode, anode with a slit, and a third electrode at the end.</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> High voltage was applied, and an electrometer measured current between the first and third electrodes. A magnet was then used to deflect the beam.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong>
<ul>
<li>An electrical current flowed, indicating a component of electricity in the rays.</li>
<li>The magnet deflected the beam, causing the current to stop.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The <strong>negative charge and the rays were inseparable</strong>, indicating they were a single entity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Experiment 2:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To further confirm that cathode rays were streams of electrical charge.</li>
<li><strong>Setup:</strong> A vacuum tube with a hole in the anode to create a thin beam, phosphorescent paint at the end, and two parallel metal plates in the flight path.</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> High voltage was applied across the deflection plates.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> The beam bent towards the positive plate.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The deflection confirmed that the <strong>rays were indeed streams of electrical charge.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Experiment 3:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To confirm the nature of cathode rays using magnetic deflection.</li>
<li><strong>Setup:</strong> Similar to Experiment 2, but with external magnetic coils instead of deflection plates.</li>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> A controlled magnetic field was applied across the tube.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> The beam deflected predictably in the magnetic field.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The results from both electrostatic and magnetic deflection solidified Thompson’s understanding.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Thompson concluded that cathode rays are composed of tiny, negatively charged particles he called “corpuscles”.</strong>
<ul>
<li>These particles were later named <strong>electrons</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Based on the deflection angles, he calculated the <strong>charge-to-mass ratio</strong> of the corpuscles.
<ul>
<li>He determined that the <strong>mass was negligible</strong>, and the <strong>charge was negative</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Thompson proposed the “plum-pudding model” of the atom.</strong>
<ul>
<li>This model depicted the atom as a <strong>large, positively charged sphere with embedded negative corpuscles (electrons).</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Thompson’s discoveries revolutionized physics.</strong>
<ul>
<li>He demonstrated that atoms, previously thought indestructible, could be disassembled.</li>
<li>He won the <strong>Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Physics was now able to detect subatomic particles through indirect means.</li>
<li>The study of physics became more organized, standardized, and systematic.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Philipp von Lenard</strong>, a German physicist, <strong>worked on bringing cathode rays out of the vacuum tube.</strong></li>
<li>He built a tube with a thin metal window that allowed cathode rays to escape.</li>
<li>He observed that some rays were scattered when passing through the window.</li>
<li>Lenard proposed that atoms were mostly empty space (vacuum) to explain the scattering.
<ul>
<li>He suggested that <strong>a cubic meter of platinum was as empty as outer space</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This was a radical idea that challenged the prevailing view of atoms as solid, continuous entities.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hantaro Nagaoka</strong>, a Japanese physicist, <strong>developed a “Saturnian” model of the atom based on James Clerk Maxwell’s work on Saturn’s rings.</strong></li>
<li>He proposed that electrons orbited a central positive charge like rocks orbiting Saturn.</li>

<li>The repulsive force between electrons would cause them to fly apart, unlike the gravitational attraction that holds Saturn’s rings together.</li>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rutherfords-alpha-particle-scattering-and-the-discovery-of-the-nucleus">Rutherford’s Alpha Particle Scattering and the Discovery of the Nucleus</h5>
<ul>
<li>Rutherford, intrigued by Lenard’s claim of atomic vacuum, conducted experiments with alpha particles.</li>
<li><strong>He used a magnetic field to deflect alpha particles and observed their scattering through a thin piece of mica.</strong>
<ul>
<li>The mica deflected alpha particles more than the strongest magnet.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rutherford moved to the University of Manchester in 1907.</li>
<li>In 1908, he proved that alpha particles were helium atoms stripped of their electrons.</li>
<li><strong>In 1910, Rutherford, Hans Geiger, and Ernest Marsden conducted the Gold Foil Experiment.</strong>
<ul>
<li>They aimed a beam of alpha particles at a thin gold foil and observed their scattering using a zinc sulfide screen and microscope.</li>
<li>They unexpectedly found that some alpha particles were deflected at very large angles, even bouncing backwards.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rutherford interpreted this as evidence for a dense, positively charged nucleus at the center of the atom.</strong>
<ul>
<li>He realized that most of the atom’s mass and positive charge were concentrated in a tiny nucleus.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rutherford’s model replaced the plum-pudding model.</strong>
<ul>
<li>He envisioned the atom as mostly empty space with a dense nucleus and orbiting electrons, similar to a miniature solar system.</li>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="niels-bohr-and-the-quantum-leap">Niels Bohr and the Quantum Leap</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Niels Bohr</strong>, a brilliant physicist, recognized the connection between Einstein’s light quanta and atomic structure.</li>
<li>Bohr worked with <strong>Rutherford</strong>, whose <strong>solar system model of the atom</strong> had limitations:
<ul>
<li>Electrons orbiting the nucleus should repel each other.</li>
<li>An orbiting electron, constantly accelerating, should emit radiation and eventually collapse into the nucleus, contradicting the stability of atoms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bohr was inspired by <strong>spectral lines</strong>, the unique patterns of light emitted by excited gases.
<ul>
<li><strong>Balmer’s formula</strong> (1885) could predict the wavelengths of hydrogen’s spectral lines using integer values.</li>
<li><strong>Rydberg’s formula</strong> (1890) generalized Balmer’s formula for other elements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bohr realized that the <strong>integers in these formulas implied quantization of the emitted light</strong>.</li>
<li>He proposed that electrons exist in <strong>discrete energy states</strong>, not continuous orbits.</li>
<li><strong>Electrons jump (quantum leap) between these energy states</strong>, emitting or absorbing specific amounts of energy corresponding to the spectral lines.</li>
<li>Bohr’s model successfully <strong>derived the Rydberg constant</strong> using fundamental constants (electron mass, electron charge, Planck’s constant).</li>
<li>It validated Einstein’s light quanta theory, Planck’s equation, and provided a physical basis for Balmer and Rydberg’s formulas.</li>
<li>Bohr effectively <strong>invented quantum mechanics</strong>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Heisenberg proposed that at the atomic level, there are <strong>fundamental limits to the precision of measurement</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The act of measuring a quantity inevitably disturbs the system</strong>, leading to a loss of information about other quantities.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Measuring the <strong>position</strong> of an electron precisely (e.g., with a flash photograph) makes its <strong>speed</strong> unknowable.</li>
<li>Measuring the <strong>speed</strong> of an electron precisely (e.g., by scattering gamma rays) makes its <strong>position</strong> unknowable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Since an electron’s energy (and thus speed) can be precisely measured using spectroscopy, its position becomes uncertain.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>1920s:</strong> The structure of the <strong>atomic nucleus</strong> remained an enigma, as experimental physics entered a period of contemplation.</li>
<li><strong>Lord Ernest Rutherford’s Bakarian lecture (June 3rd, 1920):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Topic: <strong>Transmutation of nitrogen atoms</strong> using <strong>alpha particles</strong>.</li>
<li>Rutherford deviated from the main topic, raising a critical question about atomic weight discrepancies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Atomic Weight Problem:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Established understanding:</strong> Atoms consist of <strong>electrons</strong> (negative charge) orbiting a <strong>nucleus</strong> composed of <strong>protons</strong> (positive charge). The number of protons and electrons is equal, resulting in a neutral atom.</li>
<li><strong>Discrepancy:</strong> Atomic weights of elements heavier than hydrogen did not align with the number of protons.
<ul>
<li>Example: Helium has two protons but weighs four times as much as hydrogen (which has one proton).</li>
<li>Further examples:
<ul>
<li>Nitrogen: 7 protons, atomic weight of 17.</li>
<li>Barium: 58 protons, atomic weight of 137.</li>
<li>Uranium: 92 protons, atomic weight of 238.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rutherford’s hypothesis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Proposed the existence of a neutral particle within the nucleus, which he called the <strong>neutron</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Neutron properties:</strong>
<ul>
<li>No electrical charge.</li>
<li>Weight equivalent to a proton.</li>
<li>Ability to penetrate matter easily.</li>
<li>Undetectable by existing radiation detectors.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Elusive Neutron:</strong>
<ul>
<li>For 12 years after Rutherford’s lecture, experimentalists struggled to find the neutron.</li>
<li><strong>Erroneous assumption:</strong> The neutron was thought to be a proton with an embedded electron.</li>
<li><strong>Failed attempts:</strong> Efforts to create neutrons by bombarding hydrogen with electrons proved unsuccessful.</li>

<li>Studied physics at the University of Manchester, inspired by Rutherford’s lecture.</li>
<li>Obtained a Master of Science in Physics from the University of Cambridge.</li>
<li>Worked with Hans Geiger in Germany on the <strong>Geiger counter</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>World War I:</strong> Interned at Ruhleben POW camp in Germany.
<ul>
<li>Continued scientific pursuits even in captivity, investigating the ionization of phosphorus and the photochemical reaction of carbon monoxide and chlorine.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Returned to England after the war and rejoined Rutherford’s team.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Chadwick’s Experiments:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tasked with finding the neutron.</li>
<li>Began by bombarding various materials with <strong>alpha particles</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Alpha particles:</strong> Helium nuclei, heavy and capable of causing nuclear disintegration.</li>
<li><strong>Beryllium anomaly:</strong>
<ul>
<li>When bombarded with alpha particles, beryllium emitted an unusually high intensity of <strong>gamma rays</strong> but no proton debris.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Role of Polonium-210:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Chadwick needed a strong <strong>polonium-210 alpha source</strong> (which emits alphas without gamma contamination) for his experiments.</li>
<li><strong>Irene Joliot-Curie</strong> and <strong>Frederic Joliot-Curie</strong> possessed the largest polonium-210 source at the time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Joliot-Curies’ Experiments (1931):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Used their alpha source and an <strong>ionization chamber</strong> to study beryllium’s response to alpha bombardment.</li>
<li><strong>Ionization chamber:</strong> A metal can filled with air and a central wire; ionizing events create a conductive trail, allowing for the detection and measurement of radiation.</li>
<li><strong>Cellophane experiment:</strong> Observed that gamma rays from beryllium, after passing through cellophane, caused a surge of protons in the detector.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Attributed the proton emission to the gamma rays knocking protons out of the hydrogen in the cellophane.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Chadwick’s Reinterpretation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Found the Joliot-Curies’ explanation implausible due to the significant mass difference between gamma rays and protons.</li>
<li>Obtained a large polonium-210 source from used radon ampoules.</li>
<li>Replicated the experiment using a beryllium target, paraffin sheet, and an ionization chamber.</li>
<li><strong>Chadwick’s deduction:</strong> The protons detected were not caused by gamma rays but by collisions with neutral particles of similar mass emitted from the beryllium – neutrons.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Chadwick’s Announcement:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Published “Possible Existence of a Neutron” in <em>Nature</em> (February 1932).</li>

<ul>
<li>Read about Rutherford’s skepticism regarding nuclear power in <em>The Times</em>.</li>
<li>While crossing the street, Szilard conceived the idea of a <strong>nuclear chain reaction</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Chain Reaction Concept:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Neutron’s role:</strong> Neutrons, being uncharged, can penetrate nuclei easily.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sachs delivered the letter to Roosevelt on October 11, 1939.</li>
<li>Instead of reading the letter, Sachs summarized its key points.</li>
<li>Roosevelt recognized the threat and initiated action.</li>

<li><strong>The Uranium Committee:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Uranium Committee</strong> was formed and held its first meeting on October 21, 1939.</li>
<li><strong>Dr.&nbsp;Lyman L. Briggs</strong> headed the committee, with representatives from the Army and Navy present.</li>
<li>Szilard and Wigner presented their case, but the Army representatives were skeptical.</li>
<li>Teller requested $6,000 for initial research, which was granted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>British Developments:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In February 1940, the British government received a report about potential German nuclear weapons research.</li>
<li>The <strong>Maud Committee</strong> was formed to evaluate the feasibility of nuclear power and weapons.</li>
<li>By December 1940, the Maud Committee concluded that a uranium bomb was feasible and could change the course of the war.</li>
<li>Recognizing their limited resources, they recommended collaboration with the US.</li>
<li>A report was sent to Briggs, but he locked it in his safe and forgot about it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>NDRC and Project S-1:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vannevar Bush</strong> formed the <strong>National Defense Research Committee (NDRC)</strong> in June 1940.</li>
<li>By July 1941, the NDRC absorbed the Uranium Committee, and the sustained fission initiative became <strong>Project S-1</strong>.</li>
<li>Bush appointed <strong>Arthur Compton</strong> as the director of S-1.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pearl Harbor and the Escalation of the Project:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, officially brought the US into World War II.</li>
<li>Four days later, Germany declared war on the US.</li>

<li><strong>A Parallel Threat:</strong> Another line of nuclear physics research was developing at the University of California, Berkeley.</li>
<li><strong>Quantum Mechanics and Nuclear Structure:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quantum mechanics</strong> provided a solid model of atomic structure.</li>
<li>Scientists applied quantum principles to understand the nucleus, composed of <strong>protons</strong> and <strong>neutrons</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Element 94:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Quantum mechanics predicted the existence of <strong>Element 94</strong>, a hypothetical element beyond uranium, which could be fissile.</li>
<li>The fissile isotope would be <strong>isotope 239</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Transmutation and Neutron Capture:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transmutation</strong> of elements was possible through nuclear decay and neutron capture.</li>
<li>Uranium could potentially be transmuted into Element 94 through neutron absorption.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ernest O. Lawrence and the Cyclotron:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ernest O. Lawrence</strong> invented the <strong>cyclotron</strong>, a device that could accelerate particles to high speeds.</li>
<li>Lawrence built increasingly larger cyclotrons at Berkeley.</li>
<li>The cyclotron could produce neutrons by bombarding beryllium with deuterons.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Glenn Seaborg and the Synthesis of Element 94:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Glenn Seaborg</strong> used Lawrence’s cyclotron to synthesize <strong>iodine-121</strong> and <strong>iron-59</strong>.</li>
<li>In August 1940, Seaborg attempted to synthesize Element 94.</li>
<li>On February 23, 1941, they isolated a unique alpha emitter, believed to be Element 94.</li>
<li>On February 26, 1941, they confirmed the synthesis of Element 94, which they named <strong>Plutonium (Pu)</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Challenge of Plutonium Production:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Producing gram quantities of plutonium using the cyclotron would take an impractically long time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Need for a Nuclear Reactor:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>nuclear reactor</strong> was needed to produce a massive source of neutrons for converting U-238 into Pu-239.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Enrico Fermi and the First Nuclear Reactor:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enrico Fermi</strong> and his team at the University of Chicago built the first nuclear reactor in late 1942.</li>

<li><strong>The OSRD and Project S-1:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The NDRC evolved into the <strong>Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD)</strong>.</li>
<li>Arthur Compton continued to lead Project S-1.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fermi’s Team and the Move to Chicago:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fermi’s team conducted experiments at Columbia University before moving to Chicago for greater secrecy and space.</li>
<li>They chose an abandoned squash court under the West Stands of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Construction of CP-1:</strong>
<ul>
<li>On November 16, 1942, Fermi’s team began constructing the <strong>“pile”</strong>, later known as <strong>Chicago Pile 1 (CP-1)</strong>.</li>
<li>CP-1 was a roughly spherical structure made of graphite bricks and uranium cylinders, with <strong>cadmium control rods</strong> to regulate the reaction.</li>
<li><strong>Neutron detectors</strong> and recording equipment were installed on a balcony overlooking the court.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Experiment:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The experiment to achieve a self-sustaining reaction was scheduled for December 2, 1942.</li>
<li><strong>George Weil</strong> controlled a major control rod, while others stood by with cadmium salt solution and a fire axe as emergency measures.</li>
<li><strong>Norm Hilberry</strong> was prepared to cut a rope holding a <strong>“zip rod”</strong> for emergency shutdown.</li>
<li>Fermi, Compton, <strong>Herb Anderson</strong>, and <strong>Walter Zinn</strong> operated the control panel.</li>
<li><strong>Leona Woods</strong> was the only woman present and recorded the experiment in her notebook.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Sequence of Events:</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li>At 9:45 a.m., the experiment began with the withdrawal of electrically driven control rods.</li>
<li>At 10:00 a.m., Zinn pulled out the gravity rod.</li>
<li>Fermi directed the withdrawal of the <strong>vernier control rod</strong> in stages, observing the neutron count rate.</li>
<li>At 11:35 a.m., the automatically actuated safety rod was accidentally triggered, shutting down the reaction prematurely.</li>
<li>Fermi called for a lunch break.</li>
<li>At 2:00 p.m., the experiment resumed.</li>
<li>At 3:20 p.m., Fermi called for further withdrawal of the vernier control rod.</li>
<li>At 3:52 p.m., Fermi announced that the <strong>reaction was self-sustaining</strong>, proving the feasibility of nuclear power.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Compton’s Phone Call:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Compton informed <strong>James B. Conant</strong>, head of the S-1 funding committee, about the success using a coded message: “The Italian navigator has landed in the New World.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Aftermath:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The pile was shut down, having produced power at a rate of half a watt.</li>
<li>The experiment marked a major milestone in nuclear physics and paved the way for the development of nuclear weapons and power plants.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>World War II</strong> transformed nuclear physics from an open field to a military secret.</li>
<li>Journal publications ceased, and research moved from universities to <strong>secret laboratories</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Strict security measures</strong> were implemented:
<ul>
<li>Personnel were relocated and sworn to secrecy.</li>
<li>Construction workers and laborers were unaware of the projects’ true nature.</li>
<li><strong>Code words</strong> replaced key terms (e.g., Uranium-235 became “ore alloy”).</li>
<li>Facilities were heavily guarded with barbed wire, watchtowers, and minefields.</li>
<li>Mail censorship, photography bans, and controlled documents were enforced.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Examples of secrecy:
<ul>
<li>Robert Spruill, president of the University of California and administrator of a nuclear lab, was uninformed about the lab’s purpose.</li>
<li>Laura Fermi, Enrico Fermi’s wife, remained unaware of her husband’s work until after the war.</li>
<li>Counter-stories explained unusual events to the public.</li>
<li>Foreign scientists were monitored by the FBI.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite the scale of the project, <strong>security was remarkably effective</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Germany and Japan remained unaware of the project.</li>
<li>Even Vice President Harry S. Truman was kept in the dark until FDR’s death.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Nuclear technology advanced rapidly</strong> in this secretive environment, transitioning from a theoretical topic to an industrial process in just three years.</li>

<ul>
<li>Path 1 focused on building a bomb using <strong>uranium</strong>.</li>
<li>The challenge was <strong>uranium enrichment</strong>, separating the fissile U-235 (0.7%) from the dominant U-238 (99.3%).</li>
<li>Chemical separation was impossible, as isotopes of the same element have identical chemical properties.</li>
<li>Isotope separation methods, like ultra-centrifuges and mass spectrometers, had only been used on a small scale.</li>

<li>Ionizing uranium metal.</li>
<li>Accelerating ions using an electrical charge.</li>
<li>Bending the ion path with a magnetic field.</li>
<li>Lighter U-235 ions would curve more sharply and hit a different target than U-238.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Groves approved Lawrence’s plan</strong>, despite its ambitious nature.</li>
<li><strong>Five alpha calutrons (racetracks)</strong> were built, achieving 12% enrichment.
<ul>
<li>Each racetrack was 122 feet long and 77 feet wide, containing 96 calutrons.</li>

<li><strong>“Z regulators”</strong> (voltage control systems) were operated by young women to maintain the magnetic field.</li>
<li><strong>Copper shortage</strong> for magnet windings was addressed by borrowing <strong>silver</strong> from the U.S. Treasury ($300 million worth).</li>
<li><strong>Calutrons proved inefficient</strong>: less than 5% of U-235 reached the target, the rest was contaminated.</li>
<li><strong>Beta calutrons</strong> were built for a second stage, reaching 80% enrichment.</li>

<li>The process exploited the slightly faster diffusion rate of lighter gas molecules through a permeable membrane.</li>
<li>The effect was small, requiring thousands of repetitions.</li>
<li><strong>Practical challenges</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Uranium had to be converted into gaseous <strong>uranium hexafluoride</strong>.</li>
<li>Uranium hexafluoride is highly reactive, requiring <strong>nickel</strong> for all components (pipes, valves, etc.).</li>

<li><strong>K-25</strong> was a massive building, half a mile long and 1,000 feet wide, the largest in the world at the time.</li>
<li>15,000 people were involved in its construction and operation.</li>
<li><strong>K-25 did not reach full capacity during the war</strong> due to the time-consuming nature of diffusion.</li>
<li>However, it proved to be a more efficient and less wasteful process than calutrons.</li>

<li><strong>B Reactor achieved criticality on September 26, 1944</strong>, with Enrico Fermi present.</li>
<li>However, <strong>the reactor shut down unexpectedly after an hour of high-power operation</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>John A. Wheeler</strong> identified the cause as <strong>xenon poisoning</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Xenon-135</strong>, a fission product, is a powerful neutron absorber.</li>
<li>At high power, xenon-135 buildup absorbs enough neutrons to stop the chain reaction.</li>

<li>The shipment was billed at the precious metals rate, despite being transported on flat cars without security measures typical for silver bullion.</li>

<li>On August 9th at 4:00 a.m., Tokyo learned that the Soviet Union had broken the Neutrality Pact, declared war on Japan, and invaded Manchuria.</li>
<li>At 7:50 a.m., an air raid siren sounded in <strong>Nagasaki</strong> but was a false alarm.</li>
<li>At 8:30 a.m., the all-clear was given.</li>
<li>At 10:53 a.m., two B-29s, <strong>Boxcar</strong> and <strong>The Great Artiste</strong>, were sighted but were mistaken for weather planes.</li>
<li>Captain <strong>Kermit Beahan</strong>, the bombardier on Boxcar, faced multiple problems.
<ul>
<li>They initially attempted to bomb the primary target, Kokura, but it was obscured by clouds.</li>
<li>A fuel transfer pump malfunction limited their fuel reserves.</li>
<li>They diverted to the secondary target, Nagasaki, but had difficulty seeing the ground.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite a prohibition against using radar for bomb aiming, Beahan resorted to it to avoid ditching the bomb in the ocean.</li>
<li>At 11:00 a.m. Nagasaki time, radar operator <strong>James F. Van Pelt Jr.</strong> identified the high school soccer field in the <strong>Urakami Valley</strong> on the radar scope.</li>
<li>At 11:02 a.m., Fat Man was released.</li>
<li>The bomb detonated approximately 300 feet northwest of the soccer field, destroying the industrial north end of Nagasaki, including the Shiroyama Elementary School and the Shinzei Gakkan High School.</li>

<li><strong>Edward Teller</strong> advocated for the development of a more powerful bomb (the “<strong>super bomb</strong>”).</li>
<li>Teller was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary in 1908 and experienced the communist dictatorship of <strong>Béla Kun</strong>.
<ul>
<li>This fostered a deep animosity towards communism in Teller.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Teller’s family was terrorized by soldiers searching for hidden currency.</li>
<li>The communist regime was replaced by the fascist <strong>Miklós Horthy</strong>, leading to further oppression.</li>
<li>Teller escaped to Germany, then to Copenhagen to work with <strong>Niels Bohr</strong>, and finally to the United States in 1935 with the help of <strong>George Gamow</strong>.</li>
<li>Teller held professorships at George Washington University and Columbia University before joining the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos.</li>
<li>At Los Alamos, Teller was disruptive, pushing for his super bomb and refusing to work on implosion calculations.

<ul>
<li>The <strong>General Electric Company</strong> established the <strong>Knowles Atomic Power Lab</strong> in Schenectady, New York, in 1946.</li>
<li>Their initial project was to design a nuclear-powered naval destroyer, funded by the Bureau of Ships.</li>
<li>Existing reactor technology was too large for shipboard use and needed miniaturization.</li>
<li>Two major problems hindered development:

<li><strong>Uranium shortage:</strong> The United States lacked uranium mines, and stockpiles were limited.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of nuclear engineers:</strong> The field was non-existent, with mostly nuclear physicists involved.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Physicists envisioned power reactors as <strong>breeders</strong>, using depleted uranium (U-238) to produce plutonium fuel, addressing the uranium shortage.</li>
<li>They focused on complex designs with liquid metal coolants, magnetohydrodynamic pumps, and plutonium-fueled cores using fast neutron fission.</li>

<li>Rickover was born in Mokover, Russian-controlled Poland, in 1900 to a Jewish family.</li>
<li>His family fled to the United States in 1905 to escape persecution.</li>
<li>Rickover grew up in Chicago, working hard and lacking leisure time.</li>
<li>He met Congressman <strong>Adolph Sabbath</strong> at the 1916 Republican National Convention, leading to his appointment to the United States Naval Academy in 1918.</li>
<li>Rickover graduated from the Naval Academy in 1922 and served on various ships, including destroyers and submarines.</li>
<li>His experience on <strong>S-boats</strong> (primitive submarines) exposed him to the dangers and limitations of the technology.</li>

<ul>
<li>Rickover worked on the nuclear submarine project with limited resources, borrowing office space from the Army at Oak Ridge.</li>
<li>He advocated for nuclear submarine propulsion, despite the Navy’s apparent lack of interest.</li>
<li>The Navy had actually started a secret uranium enrichment project in the Philadelphia Navy Yard, which was later absorbed into the Manhattan Project.</li>
<li>The Navy formally proposed nuclear propulsion in December 1944 (<strong>Project D</strong>), with a detailed appendix by <strong>Dr.&nbsp;Phil Abelson</strong>.</li>
<li>Rickover developed key design principles:
<ol type="1">
<li>Reactor design was primarily an engineering problem (95%), not a physics problem (5%).</li>
<li>Design should start with the propeller shaft and work backward to the reactor.</li>
<li>Assume future uranium abundance and do not constrain the design by fuel availability.</li>
<li>The reactor must fit within the diameter of an ideal submarine hull.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Captured German <strong>Type 26</strong> submarines, with their streamlined 28-foot-wide hulls, served as a model for Rickover’s nuclear submarine.</li>
<li>The nuclear submarine project faced resistance from the Navy, which was focused on managing existing ships rather than building new ones.</li>

<ul>
<li>Contemporary nuclear power plant designs are heavily influenced by Rickover’s work and his critique of the Daniels Pile project.</li>
<li>Rickover’s focus on a <strong>passively safe</strong> reactor, cooled and moderated by ordinary water, proved crucial.
<ul>
<li>Inherent safety features ensured automatic shutdown in case of malfunctions.</li>
<li>Ordinary water as a coolant eliminated flammability and toxicity concerns.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Other reactor designs, such as the Fast Breeder and gas-cooled graphite reactors, lacked this inherent safety.</li>
<li>The end of the Manhattan Project left <strong>General Leslie Groves</strong> with diminished power.

<li>He remained at Los Alamos, heading the <strong>Armed Forces Special Weapons Project</strong>, but funding dwindled.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The remaining staff at Los Alamos refined the Fat Man design (renamed <strong>MK-3</strong>).</li>
<li>The Navy requested tests to assess the effects of atomic bombs on naval vessels.</li>
<li><strong>Operation Crossroads</strong>, a series of live drop tests, was scheduled for June 1946 near <strong>Bikini Atoll</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Ninety obsolete ships, including captured enemy vessels, would be targeted.</li>

<ul>
<li>British scientists contributed expertise at Los Alamos but were excluded from production facilities like the Hanford plutonium reactors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Winston Churchill</strong> convinced <strong>Franklin Roosevelt</strong> of the need for a formal agreement to share atomic bomb expertise and data.</li>
<li>The <strong>Quebec Agreement</strong>, signed on <strong>August 19, 1943</strong>, formalized this collaboration, including <strong>Canada</strong> in the information-sharing policy due to their contribution of nuclear physicists.</li>
<li>An extended agreement signed at <strong>Hyde Park</strong> on <strong>September 18, 1944</strong>, pledged full cooperation in post-war nuclear pursuits, both military and civilian.</li>
<li>Following Roosevelt’s death and <strong>Harry S. Truman</strong>’s presidency, the modified agreement was seemingly lost, and Truman showed no interest in sharing atomic bomb information.</li>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>Atomic Energy Act (McMahon Act)</strong>, passed by the US Congress in <strong>August 1946</strong>, prohibited sharing atomic energy secrets with any foreign country, including Britain and Canada, under penalty of death.</li>
<li>The <strong>Soviet Union</strong>, despite being a wartime ally, was intentionally excluded from atomic bomb development information.</li>
<li>Soviet leaders recognized the importance of nuclear technology and initiated their own program, facing challenges such as the German invasion and a lack of resources.</li>
<li>They compensated for these limitations through a highly effective <strong>espionage operation</strong>, stealing crucial information that accelerated their nuclear development.</li>
<li><strong>Soviet spies</strong> within the Manhattan Project included:
<ul>
<li><strong>Klaus Fuchs</strong> (physicist, codenamed Charles)</li>
<li><strong>Ted Hall</strong> (physicist, codenamed Imlad)</li>
<li><strong>David Greenglass</strong> (machinist, codenamed Caliber)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Using this intelligence, Soviet scientists, led by <strong>Igor Kurchatov</strong>, built a replica of Enrico Fermi’s Chicago Pile Reactor in <strong>1946</strong> at <strong>Arzamas 16</strong> (formerly <strong>Serov</strong>).</li>
<li>By <strong>1949</strong>, the <strong>RDS-1 bomb</strong> (“<strong>Joe-1</strong>” to US intelligence) was ready for testing, a near copy of the US “Fat Man” bomb.</li>
<li>The successful detonation on <strong>August 29, 1949</strong>, in <strong>Kazakhstan</strong> yielded <strong>21 kilotons of TNT</strong>, ending the US nuclear monopoly and marking the beginning of the <strong>Cold War</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Los Alamos National Laboratory</strong></li>
<li><strong>Oak Ridge National Laboratory</strong></li>

<li>The US response was to pursue a more powerful weapon: the <strong>hydrogen bomb</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Edward Teller</strong>’s enthusiasm for <strong>hydrogen fusion weapons</strong> (“the super”) gained traction in the late 1940s.</li>
<li>Early <strong>computer simulations</strong> using <strong>ENIAC</strong> and the <strong>IBM Harvard Mark I</strong> proved Teller’s initial designs unworkable.</li>
<li><strong>Stanislaw Ulam</strong> proposed a modified design, separating the fission and fusion components and using the <strong>shockwave</strong> from the fission explosion to compress and heat the fusion fuel.</li>
<li>This led to the <strong>Teller-Ulam</strong> hydrogen bomb design.</li>
<li>Teller further refined the design, suggesting using <strong>X-rays</strong> from the fission explosion for compression.</li>
<li>The first hydrogen bomb test, <strong>Ivy Mike</strong> (“the Sausage”), took place on <strong>November 1, 1952</strong>, on <strong>Elugelab Island</strong> in the Pacific.
<ul>
<li>The explosion yielded power <strong>1,000 times greater</strong> than the Hiroshima bomb, obliterating the island.</li>

<li><strong>The Wigner effect:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Predicted by <strong>Leo Szilard</strong> and <strong>Eugene Wigner</strong> during World War II.</li>
<li>High-speed neutrons, used for moderation, displace carbon atoms in the graphite’s crystal lattice.</li>
<li>This displacement can cause the graphite to change shape, potentially damaging the reactor’s precision.</li>
<li>Displaced carbon atoms store energy, which can be suddenly released, causing a fire.</li>
<li>A graphite fire can ignite the uranium fuel, which is also highly flammable.</li>
<li>Water is ineffective in extinguishing a graphite fire and can even worsen the situation by providing oxygen and releasing explosive hydrogen.</li>

<li>Thermocouples monitored the core temperature as Wigner energy was released.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>October 11, 1957:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Davey summoned Toohey, informing him of the fire.</li>
<li>Toohey observed the fire at the reactor face and the red glow at the back end of the core through an inspection hole.</li>
<li>The fire intensified, with flames changing from red to yellow and then to hot blue.</li>
<li>Toohey, despite the risks, instructed the <strong>Works Fire Brigade</strong> to stand by with equipment.</li>
<li>By midnight, the fire was contained to 120 fuel channels (out of 3,440) by creating a firebreak.</li>
<li>Workers used scaffolding poles to push burning fuel cartridges into a water trough at the back of the core.</li>
<li>Some cartridges were jammed, and poles returned glowing red with molten uranium.</li>
<li>At 1:00 a.m., the local constable was alerted about a potential emergency.</li>

<li>The <strong>Sedan nuclear bomb test</strong> released 44 times more radiation.</li>
<li>The <strong>Chernobyl disaster</strong> released over 1,000 times more radiation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The radioactive plume primarily drifted over the Irish Sea.</li>
<li><strong>Iodine-131</strong>, with its short half-life but tendency to concentrate in the thyroid gland and milk, was a major concern.</li>

<li><strong>PWR Design:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ordinary water as both coolant and neutron moderator.</li>
<li>Closed-loop circulation of pressurized water to prevent boiling.</li>
<li>Superheated water in the primary loop heats a secondary boiling water loop, generating steam for power production.</li>
<li>Requires enriched uranium fuel due to water’s inefficiency as a moderator.</li>
<li>Inherent safety features: coolant loss leads to moderator loss and reactor shutdown.</li>

<li>Steam generators and pressurizers were eliminated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Arguments against the BWR:</strong>

<section id="untermyers-counterarguments" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="untermyers-counterarguments">Untermyer’s Counterarguments</h5>
<ul>
<li>Untermyer argued that the boiling moderator would enhance stability and control:
<ul>
<li>Steam bubble formation displaces moderator, reducing fission rate and power.</li>
<li>Reduced fission rate stops boiling, bubbles collapse, moderator density increases, fission rate climbs, and boiling restarts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>BWR Self-Regulation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The BWR would be self-regulating, adjusting power output based on steam demand without constant control adjustments.</li>
<li>Increased steam demand cools the boiling action, increasing steam production.</li>
<li>Reduced demand increases boiling, powering down the reactor.</li>
<li>Coolant loss leads to immediate shutdown.</li>

<li><strong>19th Century Cherokee Settlement:</strong> By the 1800s, Cherokees established farms and communities in the area, focusing on corn and cattle farming.</li>
<li><strong>Georgia Gold Rush (1828):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gold discovered near Dalanega sparked the first US gold rush.</li>
<li>Over 300 ounces of gold extracted daily by 1830, leading to a population boom in Dahlonega (reaching 15,000).</li>
<li>Dawson Forest, rich in gold and water resources for ore processing, became a prime target for mining.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cherokee Removal:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Cherokee population residing on gold-rich land posed an obstacle to mining expansion.</li>
<li>The federal government intervened, condemning Cherokee farms and forcing them to relocate to Oklahoma via the Trail of Tears.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Georgia Gold Lottery (1832):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Following the Cherokee removal, the forest was divided into 40-acre lots and distributed through a lottery system to promote mining.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mining Legacy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Extensive excavation resulted in numerous mine shafts throughout the forest.</li>
<li>The Georgia Gold Belt produced approximately 870,000 troy ounces of gold.</li>
