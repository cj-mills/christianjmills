## Overview

Here are some notes I took while watching Patrick Winston's [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY) on how to speak.



## Introduction

- [The Uniform Code of Military Justice](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/subtitle-A/part-II/chapter-47) specifies court martial for any officer who sends a soldier into battle without a weapon
- Students should not go out into life without the ability to communicate.
- Your success in life will largely be determined by your ability to speak, your ability to write, and the quality of your ideas
    - Your ability to speak is the most important
- Quality of communication is a function of your knowledge, how much you practice with that knowledge, and your inherent talent
    - Knowledge is the most important factor
    - Inherent talent is the least important factor
- You can get a lot better than people who have inherent talents when you have the right amount of knowledge



## How To Start

- Do not start with a joke
    - People are not ready for a joke at the beginning
- Start with empowerment promise
    - The reason for being here
    - Example: Tell people what they are going to know by the end of the conversation that they did not know at the start



## Four Sample Heuristics

- Cycle on the subject
    - Go around it again and again
    - Tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, tell them again, and again (3 times total)
    - Helps increase the probability that your audience will absorb what you are trying to communicate
- Build a fence around your idea so that it is not confused with someone else's idea
    - Explain how your idea is different
- Verbal Punctuation
    - Provide landmarks where you announce to people who lose focus that it is a good time to start paying attention again
    - Enumerate through what you have covered
    - Provide numbers
    - Give a sense that there is a seam in the talk and they can get back on
- Ask a Question
    - You can wait for about seven seconds for an answer
    - The question has to be carefully chosen
        - Can't be too obvious
        - Can't be too hard
    



## Build Up Your Personal Repertoire and Style

The Tools

- Time and Place
    - Best time to have a lecture is often 11AM
        - Most people are awake and have not gone back to sleep
        - It's not right after a meal
        - People are not fatigued
    - The place needs to be well lit
        - Low light tends to signal that it is time to go to sleep
    - The place should be "cased"
        - Go there before the talk and see what it is like
        - Make sure there are no surprises
        - Imagine the seats are filled with disinterested farm animals
    - The place should be reasonably populated
        - Get a an appropriately sized place for the expected audience size
        - More than half full
- Boards, Props, and Slides
    - Chalk is a good tool when your purpose is informing
        - You can exploit the fact that you can use graphics in your presentation
        - Speed with which you write on the board is approximately the speed at which people can absorb ideas
        - Gives you something that you can do with your hands as either something to write on or point at.
    - Slides are good when your purpose is exposition
        - Example: job talks and conference talks
        - Use fewer slides and fewer words
        - Don't read the words on your slides
        - Be in view when the audience is looking at the slides
            - Don't force your audience to constantly shift their view from the slide to the speaker
        - Slides should be condiments to what you are saying
        - Keep images simple
        - Eliminate Clutter
            - remove logos
            - remove titles: tell them the title
            - remove the bullet points from lists
        - Reducing what what is on the slide allows the audience to pay more attention to what you say
        - Use a sample slide to determine the minimum font size that is easily ledgible
            - Probably font size of 40 - 50
        - Don't use laser pointers or pointing sticks
            - When you are using these, you are not making eye contact with the audience
        - Use onscreen arrows to point to things on a slide
        - Print your presentation out and lay it out on a table
            - Makes it easy to see if there is too much in it
        - When you need to have text, give your audience time to read it
        - You can have at most one visually complex slide in a presentation
            - Example: to make a point of how incomprehensibly complex something is
    - Props
        - give the audience an idea of where the talk is going
        - helps to view a problem in a different way
        - helps emphasize a point
        - helps make the talk memorable
    - Chalk and props can help with empathetic mirroring
        - Your might feel like they are writing on the chalkboard
        - Can't do that with slides



## Special Cases

- Informing
    - Start with a promise
        - Express how cool the topic is
    - Inspiration
        - Tell beginners they can do it
        - Help the experienced see a problem in a new way
        - Exhibit passion about what you are doing
    - Teaching people how to think
        - Provide audiences with the stories they need to know
        - Provide audiences with the questions they need to ask about those stories
        - Provide mechanisms for analyzing those stories
        - Provide ways of putting stories together
        - Provide ways of evaluating how reliable a story is
- Persuading
    - Oral Exams
        - The most common reason for people failing an oral exam is a failure to situate and a failure to practice
        - situate
            - It is important to talk about your research in context
                - Example: This is a problem that is being pursued all over the world
                - Example: There has not been any progress on this before me in the past 30 years
                - Everyone is looking for a solution because it will have impact on so many other things
        - practice
            - practice does not mean sharing your slides with people you share an office with
                - If people know what you are doing, they will hallucinate that there is explanatory material in your presentation that is not there
            - a faculty supervisor is not a good person to help you debug a talk
            - you need to practice presenting with friends who do no know what you are doing
                - Start your practice session by saying if they can't make you cry, you won't value them as a friend anymore
            - It is better to have an examining committee that is much older
    - Job Talks
        - Show them that you have some kind of vision
            - a vision is in part a problem that somebody cares about and something new in your approach
        - Show them that you have done something
            - List the steps that need to be taken in order to achieve the solution to a problem (preferably the problem is the one expressed in the vision)
            - Enumerate your contributions
        - You have five minutes to express your vision and tell them what you have done
    - Getting Famous (How to ensure your work is recognized)
        - Why would you want to be famous?
            - You get used to being famous, you never get used to being ignored
            - Your ideas are like your children. You don't want them to go into the world in rags
        - How to get remembered
            - Have a symbol associated with your work
            - Have a (simple) slogan that provides a handle on the work
            - Have a surprising attribute in your work
            - Have a salient idea (an idea that sticks out)
            - Have a story that tells how you did it, how it works, and why it's important



## How to Stop

- What is the final slide?
    - Recognize collaborators on the first slide, not the last
    - Do not end with a slide saying "Questions?"
        - This is a wast of real estate as the last slide can be up there for 20 minutes
    - Do not end with a URL address
    - Do not end with a slide saying "THE END" or "Thank You"
    - The last slide is an opportunity to leave people with who you are
    - The last slide should end with your contributions
        - What you talked about
        - What you demonstrated
        - What the audience got out of it

- What are the final words?
    - Can finish with a joke
        - The audience is ready for it by then
    - Don't end with "Thank You"
        - It's a weak move
    - Could say "It's been great to be here and look forward to coming back"
