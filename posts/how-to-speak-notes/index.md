## Introduction

- **[Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/subtitle-A/part-II/chapter-47)** analogy: Sending soldiers into battle without weapons is punishable under UCMJ.
    - Similar protection should exist for students entering life without communication skills.
- **Success Formula:** Success is determined by speaking ability, writing ability, and quality of ideas (in that order).
    - Communication quality (speaking and writing) is determined by **knowledge**, **practice (P)**, and **inherent talent (t)**.
      - Knowledge is the most important factor.
      - Inherent talent is the least important factor.
- **Mary Lou Retton Analogy:** Observing Olympic gymnast Mary Lou Retton's novice skiing skills at Sun Valley highlighted the importance of **K** and **P**.
    - Despite Retton's athletic talent, the speaker's superior skiing skills stemmed from greater knowledge and practice.
- **Empowerment Promise:** This lecture will provide speaking techniques that can significantly improve your ability to communicate and have your ideas valued.
- **Rule of Engagement:** No laptops or cell phones allowed.
    - **Rationale:** Humans have a single language processor, and distractions hinder learning and speaker performance.

## How to Start a Talk

- **Avoid Jokes:** Jokes are ineffective at the beginning of a talk because the audience is not yet fully engaged.
- **Empowerment Promise:** Start with an empowerment promise that tells the audience what they will gain from the talk.
    - **Example:** "At the end of this 60 minutes, you will know things about speaking you don't know now, and something among those things you know will make a difference in your life."



## Sample Heuristics for Presentations

### 1. Cycling

- **Definition:** Repeatedly circling back to the main subject throughout the presentation.
- **Rationale:** Ensures that everyone grasps the core message, as some audience members may be temporarily disengaged at any given time.
- **Example:** Repeating a key concept three times in different ways.

### 2. Building a Fence

- **Definition:** Clearly defining and delimiting your idea to prevent confusion with other ideas.
- **Rationale:** Helps the audience distinguish your unique contribution from existing work.
- **Example:** Comparing your algorithm to a similar one while highlighting the key differences (e.g., linear vs. exponential complexity).

### 3. Verbal Punctuation

- **Definition:** Using clear markers to signal transitions and create natural re-entry points for the audience.
- **Rationale:** Helps listeners who have drifted off to easily rejoin the flow of the presentation.
- **Example:** Providing an outline, using enumerations, or explicitly announcing transitions between sections.

### 4. Asking Questions

- **Definition:** Posing questions to the audience to re-engage them and check for understanding.
- **Rationale:** Encourages active listening and participation.
- **Guidelines:**
    - Choose questions that are neither too obvious nor too difficult.
    - Allow sufficient wait time (up to 7 seconds) for audience responses.



## Developing Your Personal Style

- **Observe and Analyze:** Study effective speakers to identify the techniques they use and understand why they are successful.
- **Build Your Repertoire:** Incorporate techniques that resonate with you and develop your own unique presentation style.



## Time and Place

### Time

- **Ideal Time:** 11 a.m.
- **Rationale:**
    - Most people are awake and alert.
    - Avoids post-meal fatigue.

### Place

- **Well-Lit:** 
    - **Rationale:** Dim lighting signals sleepiness.
    - **Counterargument:** Slides are more visible in a dark room.
    - **Rebuttal:** "It's extremely hard to see slides through closed eyelids."
- **Cased:** 
    - **Definition:** Familiarize yourself with the venue beforehand to avoid surprises.
    - **Rationale:** Allows you to anticipate and address any potential challenges.
- **Reasonably Populated:** 
    - **Rationale:** Avoids the impression of a poorly attended or unimportant event.



## Boards, Props, and Slides

### Boards

- **Purpose:** Informing and teaching.
- **Advantages:**
    - **Graphic Quality:** Allows for easy incorporation of visuals.
    - **Speed Property:** Writing speed aligns with the audience's information processing speed.
    - **Target:** Provides a natural outlet for hand gestures.
    - **Example:** Seymour Papert's use of the board for constant pointing, even if unrelated to the content.

### Props

- **Custodians of Knowledge:** Playwrights understand the power of props.
- **Hedda Gabler Example:** Ibsen's use of a pot-bellied stove and a manuscript as props to build tension and foreshadow events.
- **Bicycle Wheel Example:** Seymour Papert's demonstration of how to determine the direction a spinning bicycle wheel will fall when torque is applied.
    - **Lesson:** Thinking about the problem in the right way (e.g., focusing on a small section of the wheel) leads to a clear solution.
- **Steel Ball Example:** Alan Lazarus's demonstration of conservation of energy using a pendulum in 8.01.
    - **Caution:** Do not try this at home due to the risk of pushing the ball instead of letting go.
- **Empathetic Mirroring:** Physical props and blackboards engage mirror neurons in the audience's brains, enhancing understanding and retention.

### Slides

- **Purpose:** Exposing ideas (e.g., job talks, conference talks).
- **Common Crimes:**
    - **Too Many Slides:** Overwhelms the audience.
    - **Too Many Words:** Distracts from the speaker and hinders information processing.
    - **Reading Slides:** Annoys the audience, who can read themselves.
    - **Small Font Size:** Makes slides difficult to read.
    - **Distant Speaker:** Creates a disconnect between the speaker and the slides.
    - **Laser Pointer Abuse:** Distracting and disrupts eye contact.
    - **Too Heavy:** Dense slides with minimal white space are overwhelming.
- **Rules for Slide Preparation:**
    - **Eliminate Background Junk:** Remove unnecessary distractions.
    - **Reduce Words:** Use slides as visual aids, not as text dumps.
    - **Remove Logos:** Unless essential for branding.
    - **Remove Titles:** State the title verbally.
    - **Eliminate Clutter:** Use white space effectively.
- **Minimum Font Size:** 40-50 points recommended.
- **Alternative to Laser Pointers:** Use arrows or other visual cues to highlight specific elements on the slide.
- **Hapax Legomenon:** A slide that is so complex or unusual that it can only be used once in a presentation.
    - **Example:** A diagram illustrating the complexities of governance in Afghanistan.



## Special Cases

### Informing/Inspiring

- **Promise:** Start with a clear empowerment promise.
- **Inspiration Techniques:**
    - **Expressing Passion:** Share your enthusiasm for the subject.
    - **Highlighting Coolness:** Emphasize the fascinating aspects of your work.
    - **Demonstrating Impact:** Show how your ideas can solve significant problems.
    - **Example:** Resource allocation lecture demonstrating a dramatic speedup in a coloring problem.

### Teaching How to Think

- **Storytelling Animals:** Humans are inherently storytellers, and thinking involves understanding and manipulating stories.
- **Teaching Methods:**
    - Provide relevant stories.
    - Encourage critical questioning of stories.
    - Teach mechanisms for story analysis and synthesis.
    - Develop methods for evaluating story reliability.

### Persuading

#### Oral Exams

- **Challenges:**
    - **Failure to Situate:** Not placing research in context.
    - **Failure to Practice:** Insufficient rehearsal with a critical audience.
- **Effective Strategies:**
    - **Situate Research:** Explain the problem's significance, historical context, and potential impact.
    - **Practice Extensively:** Rehearse with individuals unfamiliar with your work to get honest feedback.
- **Examining Committees:** Older examiners tend to be less harsh than younger ones.

#### Job Talks

- **Key Objectives (5-minute Rule):**
    - **Vision:** Articulate a compelling research vision.
    - **Accomplishment:** Demonstrate significant achievements.
- **Expressing Vision:**
    - **Problem:** Identify a problem that is important and unsolved.
    - **Approach:** Present a novel or unique approach to address the problem.
    - **Example:** Research on human intelligence focusing on the symbolic nature of human thought.
- **Demonstrating Accomplishment:**
    - **Enumerate Steps:** List the key steps required to achieve the vision, highlighting your contributions.
    - **Example:** Specifying behavior, enumerating constraints, implementing a system, and demonstrating results.
- **Job Talk Structure:**
    - **Vision:** Introduce the problem and your approach (5 minutes).
    - **Body:** Explain your methods, results, and contributions.
    - **Conclusion:** Summarize your contributions and highlight future directions.

#### Getting Famous

- **Winston Star (Techniques for Memorability):**
    - **Symbol:** Associate a memorable visual with your work (e.g., the arch).
    - **Slogan:** Create a catchy phrase that captures the essence of your idea (e.g., "one-shot learning").
    - **Surprise:** Highlight an unexpected or counterintuitive aspect of your work.
    - **Salient Idea:** Focus on a single key idea that stands out.
    - **Story:** Tell a compelling narrative about your research process and its implications.



## How to Stop

### Final Slide

- **Avoid:**
    - **Long Lists of Collaborators:** Diminishes the perceived individual contribution.
    - **Thank You Slides:** Wastes valuable space and is a weak ending.
    - **Blank Slides:** Wastes an opportunity to reinforce your message.
    - **Questions? Slides:** Unnecessary and wastes space.
    - **Conclusions Slides:** Focuses on conclusions rather than contributions.
- **Recommended:** **Contributions Slide:** 
    - **Purpose:** Reinforces your key contributions while the audience asks questions and departs.
    - **Example:** A slide summarizing the key achievements and insights of your work.

### Final Words

- **Acceptable:** Telling a joke (audience is now warmed up).
- **Avoid:** Saying "Thank You": 
    - Implies the audience stayed out of obligation rather than genuine interest.
- **Alternatives:**
    - **Benediction Ending:** "God bless you, and God bless [institution/country]." (e.g., Governor Christie, Bill Clinton)
    - **Saluting the Audience:** Expressing appreciation for their engagement and the opportunity to speak. (e.g., "It's been a great fun being here...")
    - **Using Established Conventions:** Mimicking culturally accepted signals for the end of an event (e.g., "Ite, missa est" in the Latin Mass).


## Conclusion

- **Importance of Presentation Skills:** Acknowledging the value of effective communication in conveying ideas.
- **Call to Action:** Encouraging continued learning and application of the presented techniques.
