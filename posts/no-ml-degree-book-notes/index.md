## Key Points

### Self-learning ML

- Start with software engineering, then transition to machine learning.
- Use free peer-to-peer CS schools to learn programming and [Fastai](https://course.fast.ai/) to learn machine learning.

### Hireability

* Search for small companies, companies with specific needs, and organizations with practical interviews.
* Employers hire self-learners based on validated real-world results.

### Portfolio

* Create a solid portfolio that requires high-effort focus and develop rigorous work habits.

- The safest portfolio projects involve publishing papers, machine learning competitions, and contributing to open-source projects.
- The second-best projects are creating live ML products, collaborating with people in the industry, and developing ML content with high engagement.
- Result-based portfolio projects have metrics or testimonials, a context, and third-party validation.
- Improve promising existing projects instead of coming up with gut project ideas.



## Programming

### Start with Programming

- There are far more entry-level positions in software development.
- Aim for at least six months to two years of study and work experience.

## Machine Learning

### Learning Machine Learning

- Prioritize creating a great resume instead of building competitive interview skills.
  - A strong portfolio weighs heavier than a boot camp graduation.

- Focus on ML opportunities that have practical interviews and light theory requirements.
- Learn data-centric problem-solving tools.
- Identify, scope, communicate and solve problems.
- Build a portfolio with externally validated results.
- Gain a light overview of ML and statistics.
- Many companies look for strong programmers and offer on-the-job ML training.

### Practical ML Courses

- Pick a practical ML course and study it for one month.
    - After the first month, 90% of your focus should be on your portfolio.

- Classic machine learning is still prevalent in the industry and often shows up in interviews.
    - Explore one or two videos each evening from StatQuest's [Statistics Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBigTkBLU6g&list=PLblh5JKOoLUK0FLuzwntyYI10UQFUhsY9) and [Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9_4yMHFhI&list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF) playlists.

## A Base Portfolio

### Weak Portfolio Projects

- Don't include toy projects like MNIST on your resume.
- ML projects that are too hard for the recruiter to evaluate or lack results don't help your resume.
- Self-learners need to differentiate themselves from fake and low-effort portfolios.

### Degree Equivalent Portfolio Projects

- Degree equivalent projects are 1-3 months long, results-driven projects that provide evidence you can do the job and are easy for recruiters to understand.
- A non-expert recruiter needs third-party validation that you didn't copy-paste your projects.

#### Primary Options

- Achieve a high-ranking score in an ML competition.
- Contribute to a popular ML open-source project.
- Write a paper that gets published (this is mostly for transitioning STEM researchers).

#### Secondary Options (require more effort for recruiters)

- Create an ML project with real users (ideally, a deployed model with a UI).
- Create an industry-specific solution with a mentor that provides testimonials.
- Create ML content with high engagement, such as blogging, podcasts, and videos.

### High-effort Projects

- Smaller ML competitions like niche competitions on Kaggle, Numerai, ML conference competitions, or company competitions are great portfolio projects.
- Open-source contributions to up-and-coming projects are often the best way to collaborate and get to know people in ML.

| Open-Source Projects                                         | Description                                                  |

### Industry Portfolio Projects

- Portfolio projects that solve a real problem need someone that vouches for your solution.
- Email ten to twenty ML engineers at startups you respect and ask them for industry problems with accessible data you can tackle.
- Try people on Twitter with less than 10k followers and a blog.
- ML engineers can put you in a good starting point, scope the project, help you when you get stuck, and potentially hire or recommend you later.
- Approach people who post [data-related freelance](https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/data-science/) projects on freelancer marketplaces and look at sites that post [pro-bono data projects](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/12/data-science-volunteering.html).

#### Email Example

```text
Title: Industry ML problems
Hi Jane,
Iâ€™m self-studying deep learning [Link to github] and Iâ€™m looking
for problems I can tackle for my portfolio.
Given your interesting work on Twittersâ€™s recommendation
system [link to their blog], I thought you could have exposure to
other unique industry problems.
Iâ€™m thinking of using Twitterâ€™s API to do an NLP analysis to
detect the percentage of bots on Twitter. Is that a good entry-
level problem to tackle or can you think of something else?
Cheers,
Bob
```



## Talent Projects

* Talent projects are 1-4 week open, result-driven projects that help you stand out once in an interview.

- Talent projects focus on novelty and result in a demo, blog post, or visual.
- Talent projects indicate a passion for a particular topic, establish personal branding, and help create a developer advocacy skillset.
- Talent projects are hard to execute and introduce more noise for recruiters.

| X-factor Projects                                            | Description                                                  |

### Developer Advocacy Projects

- Developer advocacy roles focus on engagement through content and can work as a transition into more technical roles.
- External excitement is an indicator that you made a unique contribution.



## Self Evaluation

### Metric-based Portfolio Items

- Portfolio items need metrics, context, and third-party validation.
- Third-party validation reduces the doubt you made a mistake or made things up.

#### Example Portfolio Item

```text
A skin cancer classification model with 90% accuracy on
Benchmark X with a previous SOTA of 85%. Published in
Machine Learning Conference X as the first author.
```

### Testimonial-Based Portfolio Items

- Contributing to popular frameworks demonstrates you understand what they need and understand the framework enough to improve and pass a technical review for your submission.

#### Example Portfolio Item

```text
A released open-source contribution to PyTorch, the LAMB
optimizer [link], and a blog post [link].
```

- You can also request a quote from the framework's team.

    ```text
    "X made a fast and well-documented implementation of
    the LAMB optimizer in PyTorch.", Employee X at
    Facebook Meta. [endorsement link], [commit link] and a
    blog post [link]
    ```

- Public endorsements on Twitter, LinkedIn, or GitHub make them verifiable.

### Product Portfolio Items

- Live demos allow recruiters to test projects without technical expertise.
- Using a recent or custom model is more likely to convince cynical recruiters your project is original.
- Open-ended projects need a cluster of validation to compensate for less interpretable results.
- When applicable, deploy the model on a scalable back-end on a large cloud provider and show evidence it supports at least 100 QPS.

#### Example Portfolio Item

```text
A super-resolution model in production and a live UI. [link]
Optimized deployment taking the original RAM footprint
from 1 GB to 150 MB, and the CPU inference from 4
seconds to 30 ms. [Google Colab benchmark link]. 100
weekly users [Stats screenshot], 250 stars on GitHub [link],
and seen on Hacker News [link] and recommended by X,
at Famous company. [link to tweet]
```



## Ideas

### Base Portfolio Ideas

- Avoid gut ideas until you have a few years of experience to tell if it's good.
- Good base portfolio ideas are validated problems and allow you to translate hard work into outcomes with as few risks as possible.

### Talent Project Ideas

- It is better to overdeliver on a tiny real problem than to make a vague attempt on an ambitious one.
- Successful talent projects lead to short and clear stories.
- Try ranking a few dozen project areas rather than deciding between a few specific ideas.
Ideas that appear in any mainstream channel are likely overused.

### Sourcing Ideas

- Starting Points
    - Top ML conferences from 1987 to 2007
    - Stanfordâ€™s [CS224n](https://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/cs224n/), [CS329S](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/) & [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/index.html) projects
    - FastAI [student projects](https://twitter.com/EmilWallner/status/1522207033931403264)
    - Twitter [likes](https://twitter.com/EmilWallner/following) and GitHub [stars](https://github.com/emilwallner?tab=following)
    - Creative projects like [AK](https://twitter.com/ak92501), [ML x Art](https://mlart.co/), [NeurIPS gallery](http://www.aiartonline.com/)
    - Edge devices and [hardware projects](https://twitter.com/EdgeImpulse)
    - Kaggle [Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=1st+place)
    - Top 15-40% of papers on [Arxiv Sanity](https://arxiv-sanity-lite.com/)
- Aim for projects made by people early in their careers.

### Ranking Ideas

- Try to gather at least 20-30 project ideas before ranking them.
- Can you impress a non-technical person in less than 30 seconds?
- Can you find a quick way to run the model?
- Do you have enough computing resources and knowledge for the project?
- Is there an apparent angle to improve the project?
- Does the project excite you?
- Ranking a project often depends on whether you will use the project for your resume, personal marketing, getting a developer advocacy role, or something else.
- Narrow down the list to five projects and pick the most exciting one.
- If you can't create a baseline within the first week, move on to something else.

### Promoting Projects

- Have something highly visual or a few-click online demo to make it more shareable on social media.
- Spread good vibes on Twitter and have a good reply game to build an audience.
- Share projects that use specific tools/products in their Slack channels and Discord groups.
- Add models to model platforms like [Huggingface Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces), [Replicate](https://replicate.com/), [Modelplace](https://modelplace.ai/), and [Runway models](https://runwayml.com/hosted-models/).
- Look into using Google's Keyword tool, other mainstream SEO tools, Google's trending topics, and Youtube's Keyword tool to increase search traffic.



## Workflow

### High-effort Focus

- Starting with a blank page and trying to build your first project requires high-effort focus.
- Resource for building high-effort focus
    - [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits)
    - [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/)
- Building high-effort focus requires good sleep, exercise, and food routines.
- Sleep at least 8 hours, ideally 9 hours, in a quiet, dark, and cool environment.
- Exercise at least 20 minutes per day to elevate your heart rate.
- Eat healthy food that does not spike your sugar levels.
- Use tiny habits to gradually increase your capacity for high-effort focus to 1-3 hours per day.

### Learning Schedule

- 8:00am-2:00pm: High-effort focus (scoping, coding, major refactoring)
- 2:00pm-6:00pm: Low-effort focus (light debugging and simple refactoring)
- 6:00pm-10:00pm: Mid-effort focus (learning gaps + skimming)
- Try taking long breaks during lunch for exercise and leisure to reenergize for another high-effort session.



## Job Hunting

- The ideal hiring process for self-learners is specialized, practical, or small-scale.
  - This hiring process is more prevalent with smaller organizations, startups, companies with specific cultures, or specialized teams within larger organizations.
  - Hiring managers are technical, and questions cater to each candidate's work are reflect skills for the job.


### High-growth Startups and Small Organizations

- Smaller companies that have technical hiring managers, technical founders, and few applicants are good choices for self-learners.
- These companies need people who can add value on day one.
- The hiring process can vary more between small companies, and you often need to do more adjacent work related to ML.
- Places to look for startups
    - [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/search?q=ai&topics=Artificial%20Intelligence)
    - [Y Combinatorâ€™s list of startups](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies)
    - [Angel list](https://angel.co/jobs)
    - [Ask HN: Who is hiring?  monthly threads](https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=pastYear&page=0&prefix=true&query=ask%20hn%3A%20who%20is%20hiring&sort=byPopularity&type=story)
    - [remote jobs](https://remoteok.com/)
    - local incubators and offices
    - portfolios of [angel investors](https://betaboom.com/blog/top-angel-investors/)
- Reach out to your professional, social, and personal networks.
- Research institutions often need people who can do the more engineering-heavy side of their ML research.

### Midsized and Large Companies

- Search for no-degree graduates on LinkedIn and see where they work or ask them directly.
- Look for companies that actively look for [non-degree candidates](https://www.nocsdegree.com/jobs/).
- Attract companies with online and social media presence.
- Use interview-as-a-service companies like [TripleByte](https://triplebyte.com/).
- Browse Glassdoor and look for companies with [practical interviews](https://www.glassdoor.fr/Overview/Working-at-Skyscanner-EI_IE437400.11,21.htm?countryRedirect=true).

### Resume

- Aim for half a page with essential contact information, tech jobs, and one or two bullet points with your most impressive ML projects.
- Don't refer to yourself as an ML enthusiast, add jargon, or make the resume more than one page.

### Email Templates for Contacting Startups

- Email the company's founder and CEO and send two follow-up emails one week apart if they don't reply.
- Email companies regardless of whether they have open positions.

#### Email Template

```text
Title: Entry-level ML positions
