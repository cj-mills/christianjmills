## Overview

Here are some notes I took while watching Mayuko's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veAR0DUI-b4) on how to get your first tech job.



## Social Media

- Stay updated with social media
    - When a job opens it usually goes really fast



## Recruitment Events

- Go to recruitment events
    - Companies put a lot of effort into these events
    - Often will automatically get a link for the take-home assignment for the interview
    - Recruiters want to talk to candidates who can at least pass the computer science fundamentals
    - Big companies can have lots of events
    - Check LinkedIn for news about upcoming events by specific companies
    - Check the company's YouTube channel for news as well
    - Check [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/)



## Job Sites

- Make sure your LinkedIn profile is optimized with key words
    - Example: Make sure you have the words "Software Developer" if that is the job you are looking for
    - Be specific in the About section about the specific type of software engineer you are or aspire to be.
    - Doing hackathons counts as experience
    - Working on open source projects counts as experience
    - Internships
    - Projects you have worked on
        - Name of the project
        - Bullet points
            - Your accomplishments
            - What you did
            - How you got to that point
- Use [Triplebyte: Engineer Job Search, Refactored.](https://triplebyte.com/)

    - Engineering job search
    - Companies pay to source for candidates
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [Hired - Job Search Marketplace. Tech Job Hunting Simplified!](https://hired.com/)
- [Remote Tech Jobs](https://www.remotetechjobs.com/)



## Build Relationships

- Build relationships with people
    - Join hackathons
    
    - Build relationships with hiring managers and other software engineers
    
    - On LinkedIn, don't just reach out to managers, reach out to people who were in your shoes
        - Reach out to people who have been in the role you are interested in
        - See what you can learn from them
        
        

## Preparing for the Interview

- Technical skills are important, but not the only way
- You might still get the job if you demonstrate strong soft skills, even if you don't nail the technical portion
- Soft Skills
    - "Can you tell me about a time that you _____?"
    - "What did you do?"
    - "What was the end outcome?"
    - Not a lot of candidates come prepared for this.
    - Students end up sharing personal stories
        - Interviewers cannot document personal stories, from a legal perspective
        - Interviewers want concrete examples and how you navigated that situation
            - Prepare 5-7 examples
            - Structure them in a [STAR method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result)
              
                - Situation
                - Task
                - Actions
                - Results
            - rehearse them a few times
            - be prepared for follow up questions
        - Do not give hypothetical examples
- Technical Skills
    - Need to be able to talk through your approach and solution
    - You don't need to have the best technical answer
    - Be proactive about asking good clarifying questions
        - Sample Problems are intentionally vague
    - Be open to hints and feedback
    - How coachable are you?

- Focus on more specific roles for resumes and LinkedIn
    - Put the best on there

    - Whatever you put on your resume is fair game for the interview
        - Make sure you are actually good for the skills listed
        - Interviewers will calibrate interview questions based on what is in the resume
        - It is better to list one thing you are actually good at than 10 things you are iffy on
        
    - When you don't have a focus, it is hard for the hiring manager to say yes to you
        - They need to know how to best utilize you on their team
