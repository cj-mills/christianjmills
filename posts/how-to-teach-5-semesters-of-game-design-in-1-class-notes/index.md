### Introduction

- **Jason Wiser** describes his "crazy pants" game design course at Tufts University, which compresses 5 semesters of traditional game design education into a single semester.
- The course covers a wide range of topics:
  - Tabletop game design
  - Alternate reality game design
  - Game testing
  - Unity game engine and C# programming
  - 3D and 2D art and animation
  - Audio for games
  - Paper prototyping
  - Level design
  - VR tools
  - Team building and communication
  - Digital game prototyping
  - Pipeline development
  - Team management
  - Marketing
  - Industry networking
- The course's success challenges the conventional wisdom in game education of focusing on one skill at a time.
- **Ian Schreiber** (Education Summit board member) expressed skepticism about the course's feasibility. 
- Wiser's presentation aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.


### Wiser's Background and Teaching Philosophy Evolution

#### Early Career: Maximalist Approach 

- Wiser's early teaching career was characterized by a **maximalist approach** to curriculum design.
  - Teach for America experience: Taught a diverse range of subjects (international dance, art, creative writing, literature) to students who wanted as much knowledge as possible.
  - Art Institutes experience: Students were dedicated to games and animation, and Wiser aimed to maximize portfolio output in even introductory courses (e.g., 10-week intro to 3D modeling included full room interiors and two high-detailed characters).
  - Pixar workshop (2005):  Intensive course where participants enthusiastically consumed all content.
- This approach led to **high student workload and potential burnout**.

#### Shift to Concept Mastery and Confidence Building

- Wiser's priorities changed around 2011 when teaching at colleges where students had broader interests.
- **Goals shifted from maximizing portfolio content to concept mastery and confidence building**.
  - **Minimum viable product (MVP)** approach: Intro to 3D course focused on one hard surface and one organic object.
  - Emphasis on empowering students to explore concepts further outside the course.

### The Genesis of the "Crazy Pants" Course

- Wiser pitched a game design curriculum to the Tufts Computer Science department.
- Initially proposed a typical multi-course model:
  - Tabletop game design
  - Level design
  - Game environment art
  - Programming and prototyping
  - Capstone team production
- Department requested a single course with a focus on programming.
- Wiser decided to combine all five core areas into one course.
- The course was considered an **experiment** and needed to be successful to be repeated.
- Wiser aimed for **student fulfillment and engagement without burnout**.

### Course Design Strategies for Success

#### Teamwork Emphasis

- All assignments built around teamwork: 
  - Supports student motivation and creativity.
  - Provides a support network for students.
  - Includes lessons on improving teamwork skills. 

#### Robust Course Website

- Provides clear expectations and resources:
  - Detailed weekly schedule and homework reminders.
  - Lecture notes.
  - Assignment rubrics.
  - Tutorial videos for tool review.
  - Examples from past students.
  - Sources for further learning.
- **Website address:** [Game Design - Tufts](http://www.madwomb.com/tutorials/GameDesign_Tufts.html)

#### Stacking Theory

- **Stacking theory:** Students learn one thing well at a time, but exposure to other concepts without deadline pressure can spark curiosity and absorption.
- **Implementation in the course:**
  - Each 3-hour class focuses on one critical topic for that week's homework (indicated by stars in the course schedule).
  - Introduces 2-3 other ideas or toolsets that will be important later.
  - Example: Basic 3D modeling and texturing are introduced a month before they are required for homework.
- Benefits: 
  - Confidence building through repeated exposure.
  - Reduced stress and frustration.
  - By the time of final game production, students have experience with most necessary tools.

### A Student's Journey Through the Course: The Case of Samantha
