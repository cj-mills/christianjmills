## Overview

Here are some notes I took while watching Mayuko's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0USpL2kypUg) on whether cover letters are worth it for software engineering jobs.



## Probably Not Worth It

- Cover letters are not that valued in the tech industry.
- Recruiters are not going to take the time to thoroughly read it.
    - They want to higher the best people as quickly as possible
- Operate of the assumption that recruiters and hiring teams will not look at a cover letter
- The resume should tell recruiters everything they need to know
- Caveat:
    - Resumes don't always  give the full picture
        - Example: Gaps in employment
- It depends on the specific company whether it is important to communicate the things that would normally go in a cover letter.
    - Example: It can be very important to startups whether the mission resonates with you
- It is less important for larger companies where their brand and values are established and well known
- Do your research on companies of interest to get a better idea of what they are looking for
- Hiring platforms
    - provide an opportunity to showcase who you are
    - Put effort into the about me sections
        - include different hobbies that you are interested in
        - bring in recommendations
- Make sure grammar is on point
    - Grammar is used to weed out candidates early on
- Make sure the writing flows and is consistent with the resume
- The strongest way to get your foot in the door is through an inside referral.
    - Research and reach out
