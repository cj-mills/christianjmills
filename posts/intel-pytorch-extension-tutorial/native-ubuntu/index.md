## Introduction

In this tutorial, I'll guide you through setting up Intel's [PyTorch extension](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch) on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) to train models with their [Arc GPUs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/discrete-gpus/arc/desktop/a-series/overview.html). The extension provides Intel's latest feature optimizations and hardware support before they get added to PyTorch. Most importantly for our case, it now includes `experimental` support for Intel's Arc GPUs and optimizations to take advantage of their Xe Matrix Extensions (XMX). 



The XMX engines are dedicated hardware for performing matrix operations like those in deep-learning workloads. Intel's PyTorch extension allows us to leverage this hardware with minimal changes to existing PyTorch code.



To illustrate this, we'll adapt the training code from my [beginner-level PyTorch tutorial](https://christianjmills.com/posts/pytorch-train-image-classifier-timm-hf-tutorial/), where we fine-tune an image classification model from the [timm library](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models) for hand gesture recognition. By the end of this tutorial, you'll know all the steps required to set up Ubuntu for training PyTorch models using Arc GPUs.



::: {.callout-note}

The current setup process is for version [`2.0.110+xpu`](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/xpu/2.0.110+xpu/) of Intel's PyTorch extension.

## Enable Resizable BAR in BIOS

If you have an Arc GPU, one of the first things you should do is enable Resizable BAR. Resizable BAR allows a computer's processor to access the graphics card's entire memory instead of in small chunks. The Arc GPUs currently require this feature to perform as intended. You can enable the feature in your motherboard's BIOS.

Here are links on how to do this for some of the popular motherboard manufacturers:

- [ASRock](https://www.asrock.com/support/faq.asp?id=498)
- [Asus](https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1046107/)
- [EVGA](https://www.evga.com/support/faq/FAQdetails.aspx?faqid=59772)
- [Gigabyte](https://www.gigabyte.com/WebPage/785/NVIDIA_resizable_bar.html)
- [MSI](https://www.msi.com/blog/unlock-system-performance-to-extreme-resizable-bar)



## Install Ubuntu

Intel's [documentation](https://dgpu-docs.intel.com/driver/client/overview.html#client-install-options) recommends Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or newer. The [LTS](https://ubuntu.com/blog/what-is-an-ubuntu-lts-release) releases have the minimum required Linux kernel version as of 22.04.3, so we can stick with that. If you already have Ubuntu 22.04 LTS installed, ensure it's fully updated.

- [Download Ubuntu Desktop Download Page](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

The Ubuntu website provides [a step-by-step guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview) to installing Ubuntu on your PC, and you can install it alongside an existing operating system.

- **Tutorial:** [Install Ubuntu with a Bootable USB Stick](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview)

That tutorial calls for at least 25GB of free storage space, but I recommend at least 80 GB for our case. The [oneAPI Base Toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/base-toolkit.html#gs.ztyvfm) used by Intel's PyTorch extension alone takes up approximately 15GB. Additional packages, applications, models, and datasets can quickly fill space.





## Verify Resizable BAR

Once you log into Ubuntu, you can verify Resizable BAR is active by opening a terminal (`Ctrl+Alt+T`) and running the following command:

```bash
lspci -v |grep -A8 VGA
```



Here is the output for the Arc A770 16GB card:



```text
$ lspci -v |grep -A8 VGA
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation RocketLake-S GT1 [UHD Graphics 750] (rev 04) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])

	Kernel driver in use: i915
	Kernel modules: i915
```

---

Note that the `[size=16GB]` matches the total memory for the GPU. If you have the A750 8GB variant, it should read `[size=8GB]` for your GPU.





## Install Drivers

Next, we will install the compute, media, and display runtimes.

### Add Intel Graphics drivers Repository
Run the following bash commands to add the Intel Graphics drivers repository:



```bash
sudo -v && \
wget -qO - https://repositories.intel.com/graphics/intel-graphics.key | \
  sudo gpg --dearmor --output /usr/share/keyrings/intel-graphics.gpg && \
echo "deb [arch=amd64,i386 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/intel-graphics.gpg] https://repositories.intel.com/graphics/ubuntu jammy arc" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intel-gpu-jammy.list && \
sudo apt-get update
```

The above bash commands perform the following steps:

1. Refresh sudo access to avoid multiple password prompts.
2. Download the Intel graphics repository's public key.
3. Convert the downloaded key to binary and save it.
4. Add the Intel graphics repository to the APT's list of package sources.
5. Update the package list from all configured repositories, including the newly added Intel repository.



### Install packages
Now, we can install the required packages.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y \
  intel-opencl-icd intel-level-zero-gpu level-zero \
  intel-media-va-driver-non-free libmfx1 libmfxgen1 libvpl2 \
  libegl-mesa0 libegl1-mesa libegl1-mesa-dev libgbm1 libgl1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-dri \
  libglapi-mesa libgles2-mesa-dev libglx-mesa0 libigdgmm12 libxatracker2 mesa-va-drivers \
  mesa-vdpau-drivers mesa-vulkan-drivers va-driver-all vainfo hwinfo clinfo mesa-utils
```





### Verify the Installations

We can verify everything is installed correctly by running the following commands.

#### Verify the device is working with the `i915` driver
Run the following command to confirm the device is using Intel's graphics driver:

```bash
hwinfo --display
```

Here is the expected output for the A770:

```text

```

---



#### Verify Media drivers installation
Run the following commands to verify the media drivers installation:

```bash
export DISPLAY=:0.0; vainfo
```

Here is a snippet of the expected output for the A770:

```text
$ export DISPLAY=:0.0; vainfo
Trying display: wayland
libva info: VA-API version 1.18.0
libva info: Trying to open /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/iHD_drv_video.so

      VAProfileNone                   :	VAEntrypointStats
...
```

---



#### Verify Computing drivers installation
Run the following command to get a list of available OpenCL platforms and devices:

```bash
clinfo -l
```

The Arc GPU should show as one of the available devices. On my computer, the Arc GPU is device 0 for platform 2:

```text
$ clinfo -l
Platform #0: Intel(R) FPGA Emulation Platform for OpenCL(TM)
 `-- Device #0: Intel(R) FPGA Emulation Device
Platform #1: Intel(R) OpenCL
 `-- Device #0: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11700K @ 3.60GHz
Platform #2: Intel(R) OpenCL HD Graphics
 `-- Device #0: Intel(R) Arc(TM) A770 Graphics
Platform #3: Intel(R) OpenCL HD Graphics
 `-- Device #0: Intel(R) UHD Graphics 750
```

---

We can run the following command to get the properties for that device:

```bash
clinfo -d 2:0
```

The command will output a lot of information. Here is the top section of the output for the A770:

```text
$ clinfo -d 2:0

...
```

---



#### Verify 3D drivers installation

Lastly, we can run the following command to verify the 3D drivers' installation:

```bash
glxinfo | grep OpenGL
```

Here is the output for the A770:

```text
$ glxinfo |grep OpenGL
OpenGL vendor string: Intel
OpenGL renderer string: Mesa Intel(R) Arc(tm) A770 Graphics (DG2)
OpenGL core profile version string: 4.6 (Core Profile) Mesa 23.1.0-devel (git-722bcd7973)
OpenGL core profile shading language version string: 4.60
OpenGL core profile context flags: (none)
OpenGL core profile profile mask: core profile
OpenGL core profile extensions:
OpenGL version string: 4.6 (Compatibility Profile) Mesa 23.1.0-devel (git-722bcd7973)
OpenGL shading language version string: 4.60

OpenGL profile mask: compatibility profile
OpenGL extensions:
OpenGL ES profile version string: OpenGL ES 3.2 Mesa 23.1.0-devel (git-722bcd7973)
OpenGL ES profile shading language version string: OpenGL ES GLSL ES 3.20
OpenGL ES profile extensions:
```

---



## Install oneAPI Base Toolkit

Next, we install the [oneAPI Base Toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/base-toolkit.html#gs.ztyvfm), which Intel's PyTorch extension depends on. As mentioned earlier, the toolkit will take up approximately 15GB of disk space. We'll install the toolkit using the APT package manager.

Run the following commands to add the package repository and install the toolkit:



```bash
sudo -v
```

```bash
wget -O- https://apt.repos.intel.com/intel-gpg-keys/GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS.PUB \ | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/oneapi-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null
```

```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/oneapi-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.repos.intel.com/oneapi all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/oneAPI.list
```

```bash
sudo apt update
```

```bash
sudo apt install intel-basekit
```



The above bash commands perform the following steps:

1. Refresh sudo access to avoid multiple password prompts.
2. Download the system keyring for the repository.
3. Add the signed entry to APT sources and configure the APT client to use the Intel repository.
4. Update the list of available packages.
5. Install the toolkit.





## Update the Bash Run Commands File

We need to add the following lines to the end of the bash run commands file (`.bashrc`) for Intel's extension to use the oneAPI toolkit:

```bash
export ONEAPI_ROOT=/opt/intel/oneapi
export DPCPPROOT=${ONEAPI_ROOT}/compiler/latest
export MKLROOT=${ONEAPI_ROOT}/mkl/latest
export IPEX_XPU_ONEDNN_LAYOUT=1
source ${ONEAPI_ROOT}/setvars.sh > /dev/null
```

The above lines perform the following steps:

1. Add the installation location for the oneAPI toolkit as an environment variable.
2. Add the installation location for the DPC++ Compiler as an environment variable.
3. Add the installation for the Math Kernel Library as an environment variable.
4. Set the oneDNN memory layout to improve training speed.
5. Initialize the oneAPI environment.



You can run the following commands to add the above lines to the `.bashrc` file and apply the changes to the current shell:

```bash
echo -e "\nexport ONEAPI_ROOT=/opt/intel/oneapi\nexport DPCPPROOT=\${ONEAPI_ROOT}/compiler/latest\nexport MKLROOT=\${ONEAPI_ROOT}/mkl/latest\nexport IPEX_XPU_ONEDNN_LAYOUT=1\nsource \${ONEAPI_ROOT}/setvars.sh > /dev/null" >> ~/.bashrc \
source ~/.bashrc
```




## Set Up a Python Environment 

Now, we can create a Python environment to run the training code. We'll install a patched version of PyTorch needed for Intel's extension, the extension itself, and the other dependencies for the training code.

### Install Mamba Package Manager

We'll use the [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package manager to create the Python environment. You can learn more about it in my [getting started](https://christianjmills.com/posts/mamba-getting-started-tutorial-windows/) tutorial.

The following bash commands will download the latest release, install it, and relaunch the current bash shell to apply the relevant changes:

```bash
wget "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
bash Mambaforge-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh -b
~/mambaforge/bin/mamba init
bash
```





### Create a Python Environment

Next, we'll create a Python environment and activate it. The current version of the extension supports Python 3.11, so we'll use that.

```bash
mamba create --name pytorch-arc python=3.11 -y
mamba activate pytorch-arc
```



### Install PyTorch and Intel’s PyTorch extension

The following command will install the required versions of PyTorch and torchvision, along with the extension itself:

```bash
python -m pip install torch==2.0.1a0 torchvision==0.15.2a0 intel_extension_for_pytorch==2.0.110+xpu -f https://developer.intel.com/ipex-whl-stable-xpu
```



### Install additional dependencies

Lastly, we'll install the other training code dependencies. You can learn about these dependencies ([here](https://christianjmills.com/posts/pytorch-train-image-classifier-timm-hf-tutorial/#installing-additional-libraries)).

```bash
# Install additional dependencies
pip install datasets jupyter matplotlib pandas pillow timm torcheval torchtnt tqdm
# Install utility packages
pip install cjm_pandas_utils cjm_pil_utils cjm_pytorch_utils
```





## Modify PyTorch Code

It's finally time to train a model. The Jupyter Notebooks with the original and modified training code are available on GitHub at the links below.

- [pytorch-timm-image-classifier-training.ipynb](https://github.com/cj-mills/pytorch-timm-gesture-recognition-tutorial-code/blob/main/notebooks/pytorch-timm-image-classifier-training.ipynb)
- [intel-arc-pytorch-timm-image-classifier-training.ipynb](https://github.com/cj-mills/pytorch-timm-gesture-recognition-tutorial-code/blob/main/notebooks/intel-arc-pytorch-timm-image-classifier-training.ipynb)

You can also download the notebooks to the current directory by running the following commands:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cj-mills/pytorch-timm-gesture-recognition-tutorial-code/main/notebooks/pytorch-timm-image-classifier-training.ipynb \
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cj-mills/pytorch-timm-gesture-recognition-tutorial-code/main/notebooks/intel-arc-pytorch-timm-image-classifier-training.ipynb
```



Once downloaded, run the following command to launch the Jupyter Notebook Environment:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```



### Import PyTorch Extension
We import Intel's PyTorch extension with the following code:

```bash
import torch
import intel_extension_for_pytorch as ipex

print(f'PyTorch Version: {torch.__version__}')
print(f'Intel PyTorch Extension Version: {ipex.__version__}')
```

Note that we need to import PyTorch before the extension. Also, if you get the following user warning, don't worry. It's normal.

```text
UserWarning: Failed to load image Python extension: 
  warn(f"Failed to load image Python extension: {e}")
```

---



### Update PyTorch Imports

We don't want to re-import `torch` after the extension, so we'll remove that line from the `Import PyTorch dependencies` section.



::: {.panel-tabset}
## Modified

```python
# Import PyTorch dependencies
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.amp import autocast
from torch.cuda.amp import GradScaler
from torchvision import transforms
import torchvision.transforms.functional as TF
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from torchtnt.utils import get_module_summary
from torcheval.metrics import MulticlassAccuracy
```



## Original

```python
# Import PyTorch dependencies
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.amp import autocast
from torch.cuda.amp import GradScaler
from torchvision import transforms
import torchvision.transforms.functional as TF
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from torcheval.tools import get_module_summary
from torcheval.metrics import MulticlassAccuracy
```

:::



### Verify Arc GPU Availability

We can double-check that the extension can use the Arc GPU by getting the properties of the available `xpu` devices.

```python
def get_public_properties(obj):
    return {
        prop: getattr(obj, prop)
        for prop in dir(obj)
        if not prop.startswith("__") and not callable(getattr(obj, prop))
    }

xpu_device_count = torch.xpu.device_count()
dict_properties_list = [get_public_properties(torch.xpu.get_device_properties(i)) for i in range(xpu_device_count)]
pd.DataFrame(dict_properties_list)
```

<div style="overflow-x:auto;">
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>dev_type</th>
      <th>max_compute_units</th>
      <th>name</th>
      <th>platform_name</th>
      <th>support_fp64</th>
      <th>total_memory</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>gpu</td>
      <td>512</td>
      <td>Intel(R) Arc(TM) A770 Graphics</td>
      <td>Intel(R) Level-Zero</td>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>16225243136</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>gpu</td>
      <td>32</td>
      <td>Intel(R) UHD Graphics 750</td>
      <td>Intel(R) Level-Zero</td>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>26589642752</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>


In this case, the A770 is the default `xpu` device, and the integrated graphics on the CPU is available as the second device. The `total_memory` value for the integrated graphics is higher because it uses system memory.





### Update the Device Name

Next, we'll manually set the device name to `xpu`.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Modified

```python
device = 'xpu'
dtype = torch.float32
device, dtype
```



## Original

```python
device = get_torch_device()
dtype = torch.float32
device, dtype
```



::: 







### Optimize the `model` and `optimizer` Objects
Before we run the `train_loop` function, we'll use Intel's PyTorch extension to apply optimizations to the model and optimizer objects. We'll also cast the model to the `bfloat16` data type, so we can train using mixed precision. Intel's PyTorch extension only supports the `bloat16` data type for mixed-precision training currently.

## Modified

```python
# Learning rate for the model
lr = 1e-3

# Number of training epochs
epochs = 3

# AdamW optimizer; includes weight decay for regularization
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=lr, eps=1e-5)

# Optimize the model and optimizer objects
model, optimizer = ipex.optimize(model, optimizer=optimizer, dtype=torch.bfloat16)

# Learning rate scheduler; adjusts the learning rate during training
lr_scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.OneCycleLR(optimizer, 
                                                   max_lr=lr, 
                                                   total_steps=epochs*len(train_dataloader))

# Performance metric: Multiclass Accuracy
metric = MulticlassAccuracy()

# Check for CUDA-capable GPU availability
use_grad_scaler = torch.cuda.is_available()
```

### Train the Model
That's it for the required changes to the training code. We can now run the `train_loop` function. With the A770 and the dataset on an SSD, training takes between twelve and twelve and a half minutes to complete.

### Update the Inference Code
Since we cast the model to `bloat16`, we must ensure input data use the same type. We can update the inference  code using the auto-cast context manager as shown below:

## Modified

```python
# Make a prediction with the model
with torch.no_grad():
    with torch.xpu.amp.autocast(enabled=True, dtype=torch.bfloat16, cache_enabled=False):
        pred = model(img_tensor)
```

## Original

```python
# Make a prediction with the model
with torch.no_grad():
    pred = model(img_tensor)
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we set up Intel's PyTorch extension on Ubuntu and trained an image classification model using an Arc GPU. The exact setup steps may change with new versions, so check the [documentation](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/xpu/latest/tutorials/installation.html) for the latest version to see if there are any changes. I'll try to keep this tutorial updated with any significant changes to the process.
