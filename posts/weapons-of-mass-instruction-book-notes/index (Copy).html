<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>John Taylor Gatto, a former New York State Teacher of the Year, argues that compulsory schooling in America is a system of “weapons of mass instruction” designed to create a docile and compliant workforce rather than educated and independent citizens.</p>
<p>He criticizes the emphasis on standardized testing, the artificial extension of childhood, the suppression of creativity and critical thinking, and the disconnect between schooling and real-world needs.</p>
<p>Gatto calls for a radical transformation of education, advocating for self-directed learning, engagement with real-world experiences, and the dismantling of the standardized testing industry through a peaceful movement of mass refusal, inspired by the spirit of Herman Melville’s “Bartleby the Scrivener.”</p>

<li>Inglis outlined six functions of schooling:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The Adjustive or Adaptive Function:</strong> To instill unquestioning obedience to authority.</li>
<li><strong>The Integrating Function:</strong> To mold students into conformity and predictability.</li>
<li><strong>The Diagnostic and Directive Function:</strong> To determine and assign social roles to students.</li>
<li><strong>The Differentiating Function:</strong> To sort and train individuals based on their predetermined social roles.</li>
<li><strong>The Selective Function:</strong> To weed out the “unfit” individuals through a system of grades and labels.</li>

<ul>
<li>In 1909, a factory inspector’s survey of 500 working children found that 412 preferred factory work over returning to school.
<ul>
<li>Source: Helen Todd, “Why Children Work,” <em>McClure’s Magazine</em>, April 1913.</li>
<li><strong>Archive:</strong> <a href="https://uofi.app.box.com/s/agtvym7n0hvf4qw2dr5d24txsgwrgc42">Why Children Work: The Children’s Answer By Helen M. Todd</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Helen Todd received various reasons from children for favoring factory work, including:
<ol type="1">
<li>Monetary Factors:
<ul>
<li>Being paid for the factory work they do.</li>
<li>The ability to support their families financially, afford more food, shoes for babies, and other basic needs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Difficulty and Relevance of Schoolwork:
<ul>
<li>Perceived difficulty in understanding schoolwork compared to factory work.</li>
<li>Learning being perceived as hard.</li>
<li>Some children feeling unable to learn.</li>
<li>Perception that school education is not relevant to their ability to earn.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Environment at School and Factory:
<ul>
<li>Preference for the factory environment as there is less judgment compared to school.</li>
<li>The factory environment doesn’t involve name-calling or bullying as in school.</li>
<li>They can avoid the corporal punishment experienced at school for:
<ul>
<li>Failure to learn</li>
<li>Whispering</li>
<li>Having string in their pocket</li>
<li>Squeaky seats</li>
<li>Late arrival</li>
<li>Forgetting pages of the book</li>

<li>In 1919, Professor Arthur Calhoun’s <em>A Social History of the American Family From Colonial Times to the Present</em> highlighted a shift in family dynamics within schools.
<ul>
<li>Children were moving from biological families to the care of supposed “community experts” (page 175).</li>
<li>This change aligned with utopian thinkers’ aspirations, particularly regarding scientific population control.</li>
<li>Calhoun believed public education would help achieve the Darwinian and Galtonian ideal of selective breeding by controlling the reproduction of the “unfit.” (page 331)</li>

<ul>
<li>Not everyone shared Calhoun’s enthusiasm for the changes within the education system.</li>
<li>In 1922, New York City Mayor John Hyland raised concerns about an “invisible government” influencing schools.
<ul>
<li>He compared this influence to an octopus seizing its prey.</li>
<li>Hyland specifically identified the Rockefeller Foundation as the entity behind this covert control.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Eastern European geneticist Max Muller significantly influenced the Rockefeller Foundation’s investment in controlling human evolution.
<ul>
<li>Muller’s research involved using X-rays to manipulate fruit fly genetics, aiming to control mutations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Muller, like Darwin and Galton before him, believed that controlling human breeding was key to achieving a utopian society.
<ul>
<li>This belief was shared by prominent scientists and powerful economic entities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Muller, who later won the Nobel Prize, summarized his ideas in the “Geneticists’ Manifesto.”

We shall not search for embryo great artists, painters, musicians.

<li><p>William Torrey Harris, U.S. Commissioner of Education from 1889 to 1906, played a pivotal role in shaping American education.</p>

</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel:</strong> A Prussian philosopher who molded Karl Marx and J. P. Morgan</p>
<ul>
<li>Taught that history could be deliberately manipulated by provoking crises out of public view and then demanding national unity to meet those crises.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Harris aimed to create a society devoid of independent thought and action, where individuals passively awaited instructions.</p></li>
<li><p>His strategy involved alienating children from themselves, their families, traditions, and culture, leaving the state as the sole authority.</p></li>
<li><p>Harris believed that schools should instill obedience and conformity, stripping individuals of their individuality.</p>
<ul>
<li>He stated, “Ninety-nine students out of a hundred are automata, careful to walk in prescribed paths, careful to follow the prescribed custom. This is not an accident but the result of substantial education which, scientifically defined, is the subsumption of the individual.”</li>

<li><p>This concern was echoed in an 1885 Senate Committee report, which stated, “We believe that education is one of the principal causes of discontent of late years manifesting itself among the laboring classes.”</p></li>
<li><p>To control the potential for dissent, efforts were made to centralize control over education and limit local influence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Local school boards, initially numbering around 135,000, were gradually consolidated, reducing their number to 15,000 within a century.</li>
<li>This consolidation eroded community oversight and made it easier for special interest groups to influence education policy.</li>

<li><p>Forced schooling offers several benefits to those in power:</p>

<li>He argues that an educated, independent, and innovative populace posed a threat to established economic interests by:
<ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Only two audience members have ever been enraged by Gatto’s speeches.</p>
<ul>
<li>One was the son of a famous economist from California in 1992.</li>
<li>The other was a famous stock speculator from New York in 1998.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The content that enraged them was Gatto’s argument for <strong>open-source education</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open-source education</strong> is argued to be of much higher quality than traditional, rule-driven schooling.</p></li>
<li><p>This idea came to Gatto after witnessing his uncle Bud Zimmer’s success.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Stanley’s Truancy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stanley, a 13-year-old student, only attended school a few days a month.</li>
<li>Instead of attending school, Stanley worked for his five aunts and uncles, learning their businesses through hands-on experience.</li>
<li>His goal was to become self-employed, like his relatives.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Stanley’s Perspective on Education:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“‘…this way I get a chance to see how the different businesses work. You tell me what books I have to read and I’ll read them, but I don’t have time to waste in school unless I want to end up like you, working for somebody else.’”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Gatto’s Response:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gatto, impressed by Stanley’s initiative and drive, began covering for his absences.</li>
<li>Gatto adopted Stanley’s distinctive way of crossing his T’s as a reminder of the lesson he learned.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Schooling as Conditioning:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Schooling does not teach the way children learn naturally.</li>
<li>It discourages self-direction, instead emphasizing conformity and obedience.</li>
<li>It conditions students to accept boredom, envy, and limited competence as normal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Purpose of Schooling:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Schooling prepares students for a system that requires obedient, replaceable workers.</li>
<li>It encourages consumerism and a focus on trivial differences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Role of Shame:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shame is used as a primary tool for controlling students.</li>
<li>Students are taught to conform or face humiliation.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Schooling and the Hive:</strong>
<ul>
<li>H.H. Goddard, a psychologist at Princeton, referred to government schooling as “the perfect organization of the hive.”</li>
<li>Goddard believed standardized tests would expose the “biological inferiority” of the lower classes, discouraging them from reproducing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The NEA and Capital:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In 1930, the National Education Association (NEA) stated that schooling’s main purpose was the “effective use of capital.”</li>
<li>This suggests an alignment between the goals of education and the interests of the wealthy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fabian Socialism and Education:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fabian socialists, like Beatrice Webb, aimed to control the masses through “kindness” and the welfare state.</li>
<li>This approach aligns with using education to create a compliant workforce.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Schooling and Wealth Concentration:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Despite claims that education promotes equality, wealth has become increasingly concentrated in the United States.</li>
<li>The book <em>Fat and Mean</em> (1996) highlights the stagnation of working-class wages despite economic growth.</li>

<li>The Amish challenged Wisconsin’s compulsory education laws, arguing that they conflicted with their religious beliefs and way of life.</li>
<li>The Amish compared government schooling to a “mechanical milk separator” that fragmented their community and family life.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>The Amish proposed an alternative model of education that emphasized:
<ul>
<li>Small, local schools</li>
<li>Time outside of school</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto recounts finding a Harvard brochure emphasizing the increasing importance of demonstrated competency over academic credentials in the evolving job market.</li>
<li>The brochure outlines nine essential qualities for success:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Ability to ask hard questions of data</strong>: Engaging in dialectical thinking.</li>
<li><strong>Ability to define problems independently</strong>: Avoiding reliance on official definitions.</li>
<li><strong>Ability to extract useful information from irrelevant data</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Ability to conceptualize</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Ability to reorganize information for new perspectives</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Fluency in different modes of thought</strong>: Deductive, inductive, heuristic, intuitive.</li>

<li><strong>Skill in discussing issues, problems, or techniques</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Skill in rhetoric</strong>: Convincing others of your viewpoint.</li>

<section id="i-quit-i-think" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i-quit-i-think">I Quit, I Think</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Gatto wrote a short essay titled “I Quit, I Think” and submitted it to the Wall Street Journal.</p></li>
<li><p>Gatto’s essay outlined his reasons for leaving teaching, even without financial security.</p></li>
<li><p>The essay argued:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Government schooling is the most radical adventure in history. It kills the family by monopolizing the best times of childhood and by teaching disrespect for home and parents.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>The structure of schooling is compared to an “Egyptian” pyramid, representing the idea that “human value is a scarce thing.”</p></li>
<li><p>This concept, passed down through the Puritans and reflected in the bell curve, is presented as a “religious notion” with school as its “church.”</p></li>
<li><p>Gatto argues that he, as a teacher, enforces rituals and provides documentation to maintain this system.</p></li>
<li><p>He cites Socrates’ prediction that formalizing teaching would lead to the profession protecting its interests by making learning seem more complicated than it is.</p></li>
<li><p>School is described as a “jobs project,” “contract giver,” and “protector of the social order” resistant to meaningful reform.</p></li>
<li><p>Gatto criticizes the arbitrary nature of school timelines, using the example of two children learning to read at different ages:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“David learns to read at age four. Rachel at age nine. In normal development, when both are thirteen, you can’t tell which one learned first. The five-year spread means nothing at all. But in school, I label Rachel learning disabled, and slow David down a bit, too.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>He argues that labeling children as “learning disabled” or “gifted and talented” are “sacred myths” that perpetuate the school system rather than reflecting true learning differences.</p></li>
<li><p>Gatto criticizes standardized testing, bells, uniform time blocks, age grading, and standardization as punishments inflicted by the “school religion.”</p></li>
<li><p>He advocates for individualized learning:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“There isn’t a right way to become educated. There are as many ways as there are fingerprints. We don’t need state-certified teachers to make education happen. Certification probably guarantees it won’t.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Gatto calls for a “free market” approach to education, with diverse options and risk-taking.</p></li>
<li><p>He criticizes national curricula and testing, viewing them as arising from “ignorance of how people learn or deliberate indifference to it.”</p></li>
<li><p>The essay concludes with:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I can’t teach this way any longer. If you hear of a job where I don’t have to hurt kids to make a living, let me know. Come fall, I’ll be looking for work.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Gatto submitted the essay in March and “forgot it.”</p></li>
<li><p>He received a note indicating it might be published at the editor’s discretion but soon forgot about it.</p></li>
<li><p>On July 5, 1991, Gatto officially resigned from teaching.</p></li>
<li><p>Twenty days later, the Wall Street Journal published his essay.</p></li>
<li><p>Reflecting on his career, Gatto expresses disbelief at spending so much time in an “institutionalized” system:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Looking back on a thirty-year teaching career full of rewards and prizes, somehow I can’t completely believe that I spent so much of my time on earth institutionalized. I can’t believe that centralized schooling is allowed to exist at all as a giant indoctrinating and sorting machine robbing people of their children. Did it really happen? Was this my life? God help me. School is a religion.”</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="school-as-a-religion-and-its-impact-on-society">School as a Religion and Its Impact on Society</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Gatto argues that to understand the education system, one must recognize its “holy mission” aspect.</p></li>
<li><p>He believes that factors like human error, greed, or class conflict are less important than the system’s fundamental nature.</p></li>
<li><p>Gatto contends:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Ordinary people send their children to school to get smart, but what modern schooling teaches is dumbness.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>He differentiates between old-fashioned “ignorance” and modern “dumbness”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern dumbness is categorized into “permanent mathematical categories of relative stupidity,” such as “gifted and talented, mainstream, and special ed.”</li>
<li>This categorization, according to Gatto, rations learning to maintain the system and social order.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Gatto argues:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Dumb people are no longer merely ignorant. Now they are dangerous imbeciles whose minds must be conditioned with substantial doses of commercially prepared disinformation for tranquilizing purposes.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>He suggests that this “new dumbness” is particularly harmful to middle and upper-middle-class children, who are already pressured to conform.</p></li>
<li><p>These children, despite their degrees and licenses, often lack a strong sense of self and purpose, leading to potential issues later in life.</p></li>
<li><p>Gatto cites English historian Alan Bullock:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Alan Bullock, the English historian, said evil is a state of incompetence. If he’s right, then our school adventure filled the twentieth century with evil.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>He argues that schooling creates dependence on external validation, citing a family member’s aspiration to be “a small part in a great machine” as heartbreaking.</p></li>
<li><p>Gatto believes that “dumbing down” children through schooling leaves them unable to think independently and constantly seeking approval.</p></li>
<li><p>He challenges various explanations for the existence of “dumb” people:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Biological:</strong> The bell curve model.</li>
<li><strong>Socioeconomic:</strong> The neo-Marxist model.</li>
<li><strong>Moral:</strong> The Calvinist model.</li>
<li><strong>Evolutionary:</strong> The Darwinian model.</li>
<li><strong>Social Hierarchy:</strong> The pragmatic elitist model.</li>
<li><strong>Spiritual:</strong> The Buddhist model.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Gatto posits that the very concept of widespread “dumbness” is a fabrication:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The possibility that dumb people don’t exist in sufficient numbers to warrant the many careers devoted to tending them may seem incredible to you, yet that is my proposition. Mass dumbness first had to be imagined. It isn’t real.”</p>
</blockquote></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Gatto introduces Hector Rodriguez, a 13-year-old student:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Slightly built, olive-skinned, short, with huge black eyes.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>He describes an incident where he witnessed Hector attempting to slip through the gate of a skating rink despite having a paid ticket.</p></li>
<li><p>Hector’s explanation reveals he was conducting an experiment to see if he could bypass the turnstile.</p></li>
<li><p>Gatto’s research into Hector’s school records reveals a history of minor infractions labeled as “outlaw” behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>Hector attended one of the lowest-rated public schools in New York State.</p></li>
<li><p>The school rigidly categorized students into five categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gifted and Talented Honors</li>
<li>Gifted and Talented</li>
<li>Special Progress</li>
<li>Mainstream</li>
<li>Special Ed</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Gatto highlights the financial incentive for schools to label students as “Special Ed,” as they received three times more funding for those students.</p></li>
<li><p>Hector was placed in “Mainstream D,” the lowest rung above “Special Ed.”</p></li>
<li><p>His standardized test scores placed him “three years behind the middle of the pack.”</p></li>
<li><p>After the skating rink incident, Hector was arrested at his former elementary school with a fake gun.</p></li>
<li><p>His intention was to “turn the younger children loose,” to “free the slaves” like Spartacus.</p></li>
<li><p>A year later, Hector’s high school record showed failure in every subject and truancy.</p></li>
<li><p>Gatto challenges the reader to see Hector based on his school records:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Poor, small for his age, a member of a minority. Not paid much attention by people who matter. Dumb in a super-dumb class, a bizarre gate-crasher, a gunslinger, a total failure in high school. Can you see Hector?”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>He argues that the system encourages this limited and predictable view of Hector.</p></li>
<li><p>Gatto presents Hector as representative of countless children deemed problematic by the education system:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“This is the boy, multiplied by millions, whom school people agonized about in every decade of the 20th century. This is the boy who destroyed the academic mission of American public schooling, turning it into a warehouse operation, a clinic for behavioral training and attitude adjustment.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>He recounts a statement made by his school principal during a documentary filming:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Sure, the system stinks, but John has nothing to replace it. And bad as the system is, it’s better than chaos.”</p>
</blockquote></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Gatto questions whether “chaos” is the only alternative to the existing education system.</p></li>
<li><p>He argues:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The country has been sold the idea Hector is the problem of modern schooling.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Gatto asserts that this misconception is the true issue:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“That misperception is the demon we face under its many guises and behind its shape-shifting rhetoric.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>He believes that forced schooling was designed to control children like Hector.</p></li>
<li><p>Gatto concludes:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Important people believe, with the fervor of religious zealots, that civilization can only survive if the irrational, unpredictable impulses of human nature are continually beaten back and confined until their demonic vitality is sapped.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“There is such a thing as a moral odor, and that was the case at school. A group of human beings that stay in one room by compulsion begins to smell.

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="kants-questions-and-the-irony-of-modern-education">Kant’s Questions and the Irony of Modern Education</h4>
<ul>
<li>German philosopher Immanuel Kant posed four fundamental questions about education:
<ul>
<li>What can I know?</li>
<li>What may I hope?</li>
<li>What ought I to do?</li>
<li>What is man?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ironically, the German education system, widely adopted globally, stifled philosophical curiosity.</li>
<li>American compulsory schooling is not homegrown but based on the German model, as evidenced by Horace Mann’s seventh letter to the Boston School Committee.</li>
<li>Addressing Kant’s questions is crucial for developing a meaningful curriculum.</li>
<li>Neglecting this responsibility leads to education based on others’ priorities, hindering personal growth.</li>
<li>True education transcends the pursuit of money and fame, fostering contentment through self-discovery.</li>
<li>Reflecting on diverse perspectives on education can illuminate one’s own truth.</li>

<ul>
<li>James Salter found that Europe provided a unique education beyond formal schooling.</li>
<li><strong>“The thing it finally gave me was education, not the lessons of school, but something more elevated, a view of how to endure, how to have leisure, food, love, and conversation, how to look at nakedness, architecture, streets, all new and seeking to be thought of in a different way.”</strong> - James Salter</li>
<li>Europe’s rich history fosters humility and a sense of perspective.</li>
<li><strong>“In Europe, the shadow of history falls upon you, and knowing none of it, you realize suddenly how small you are. To know nothing is to have done nothing. To remember only yourself is like worshipping a dust moat.”</strong> - James Salter</li>
<li>Europe offers an immersive and boundless educational experience.</li>

<ul>
<li>John Taylor Gatto presented his vision for education in the year 2000 to the U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Human Relations on October 23, 1991.</li>
<li>He argued that schools in 2000 would likely resemble those of 1990 and 1890, highlighting the stagnation in the education system.</li>
<li>Gatto contended that true education was possible in 1790 because schooling was voluntary, short, and did not dominate children’s time or family life.</li>
<li>He believed meaningful education reform was unlikely due to political systems influenced by financial interests invested in maintaining the status quo.</li>
<li>Gatto expressed pessimism about top-down reform, suggesting that change would likely originate from individuals, particularly homeschooling families.</li>
<li>He criticized the emphasis on standardized test scores, arguing they do not correlate with valuable skills or success in life.</li>
<li><strong>“Every president of the United States, since such testing was launched, has had a mediocre to poor standardized test score. The same is more true than not among corporate executives.”</strong> - John Taylor Gatto</li>
<li>Gatto called for a national debate to define the characteristics of an educated person, emphasizing the need for clear goals.</li>
<li>He outlined his vision of an educated person:
<ul>
<li><strong>Time Management:</strong> Comfortable with solitude and utilizing time effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Capable of forming healthy attachments and understanding relationship dynamics.</li>
<li><strong>Mortality:</strong> Accepting and understanding the significance of their own mortality and lifelong learning.</li>
<li><strong>Values:</strong> Possessing a strong personal value system, critically evaluating external influences, and respecting cultural diversity.</li>
<li><strong>Creativity:</strong> Able to generate new ideas, things, and experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Truth-Seeking:</strong> Discovering truth through evidence-based reasoning, not memorization.</li>
<li><strong>Contribution:</strong> Utilizing their skills to meet societal needs and earn a living, while maintaining a healthy perspective on material wealth.</li>
<li><strong>Variety and Home:</strong> Seeking enriching experiences while recognizing the importance of home and responsibilities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto proposed a curriculum based on fundamental life experiences:
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-Discovery:</strong> Understanding one’s origins, family, culture, and personal limits and possibilities.</li>
<li><strong>Physical World:</strong> Experiential exploration and analysis of the environment.</li>
<li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Navigating various forms of human connection, including family, friendships, and community.</li>
<li><strong>Vocation:</strong> Finding a fulfilling and socially valuable career path.</li>
<li><strong>Maturity:</strong> Understanding the transition from childhood to adulthood and the accompanying responsibilities.</li>
<li><strong>Death:</strong> Contemplating death as a natural part of life and its implications for living a meaningful life.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto criticized the reliance on confinement schooling, highlighting the limitations of learning within a controlled environment.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto advocated for a decentralized education model that breaks free from traditional school structures, comparing them to “walled compounds.”</li>
<li>He argued that this new model should:
<ul>
<li>Eliminate reliance on certified teachers, allowing anyone with valuable skills to share their knowledge.</li>
<li>Embrace technology, particularly the internet, to facilitate learning.</li>
<li>Empower taxpayers by giving them control over educational spending.</li>
<li>Abolish standardized testing and its harmful effects on student ranking and learning.</li>
<li>Promote flexible learning environments, schedules, and personalized pacing.</li>
<li>Foster imagination and creativity by moving away from standardization.</li>
<li>Reduce reliance on school time, personnel, and materials.</li>
<li>Integrate learning into community life.</li>
<li>Encourage “productive sabotage” by educators and families to dismantle the existing system from within.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto emphasized that learning essential skills like reading, writing, and arithmetic can occur naturally and effectively outside of formal instruction.</li>
<li>He drew parallels between learning to drive and other complex skills, arguing that competence-based assessment is more effective than traditional grading.</li>
<li>Gatto concluded by urging senators to challenge the status quo and prioritize the needs of students over entrenched financial interests.</li>

<ul>
<li>He wants readers to question the illusions of education that schooling produces.</li>
<li>He wants readers to recognize how schooling’s influence continues long after formal education ends.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Schooling has expanded its reach over time.
<ul>
<li>It began as a limited endeavor in colonial America (two hours a day, a few months a year).</li>
<li>Today, it strives to become a total institution, resenting even summer vacation.</li>
<li>“Lifelong learning” really means “lifelong schooling.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>More schooling is often presented as the solution to societal problems.
<ul>
<li>Gatto questions this, suggesting that less school may be the cause of some of these problems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Schooling undermines other avenues of development:
<ul>
<li><strong>Family</strong>: Seen as a retrograde institution to be replaced.</li>
<li><strong>Church</strong>: Discouraged as it presents the idea of a higher power than experts.</li>
<li><strong>Tradition, ethnic loyalty, loyalty to place</strong>: All dismissed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Schooling damages conceptions of individual sovereignty and liberty.
<ul>
<li>This damage worsens with each generation as the ability to parent effectively is diminished.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Key Differences Between Schooling and Education:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organization:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Schooling: Command and control from without.</li>
<li>Education: Self-organized from within.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sources of Learning:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Schooling: Disconnects clientele from other primary sources.</li>
<li>Education: Provides bountiful, random, and diverse connections, fostering resourcefulness and self-sufficiency.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Feedback Loops:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Schooling: Emphasizes rules made by others.</li>
<li>Education: Awakens students to the importance of natural feedback loops for self-correction and independence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Focus:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Schooling: Committed to subject knowledge, creating clerks and specialists.</li>
<li>Education: Regards things in context, recognizing the power of cross-fertilization and diverse perspectives.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mindset:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Schooling: Emphasizes memory and acceptance of orthodox theory.</li>
<li>Education: Cultivates a state of dialectical argument, questioning assumptions and seeking new understandings.</li>

<li><strong>The International Happiness Survey identifies three conditions for a happy life:</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> January 29, 2008</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Nuremberg, Germany</li>
<li><strong>Summary:</strong> 16-year-old Melissa Besekrus was forcibly removed from her home by police and subjected to psychiatric evaluation for homeschooling.</li>
<li><strong>Details:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Homeschooling was banned in Germany in 1937 by the Nazi government.</li>
<li>Gatto wrote to the German ambassador questioning the continued enforcement of this ban.</li>
<li>Melissa was interrogated for 240 minutes about her reasons for homeschooling.</li>
<li>The interrogation concluded she suffered from “school phobia,” a diagnosis used to justify her removal from her family.</li>
<li>Gatto criticizes the German court order, the use of force, and the flimsy justification for intervention.</li>
<li>He draws parallels between this incident and Germany’s history of authoritarianism and suppression of individual liberty.</li>
<li>Gatto received no response from the German ambassador.</li>

<li><strong>Date:</strong> March 25, 2004</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Highland High School, Rockland County, New York</li>
<li><strong>Summary:</strong> Gatto was invited to speak at Highland High but his talk was interrupted by police, called by the superintendent, who deemed it inflammatory.</li>
<li><strong>Details:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto was invited by school board member John Jankiewicz, who was concerned about the effects of traditional schooling.</li>
<li>Gatto’s talk aimed to debunk myths about college admissions and encourage students to think critically about their education.</li>
<li>He presented data challenging the effectiveness of standardized tests and highlighting the achievements of individuals who didn’t follow traditional paths.</li>
<li>During his talk, police entered the auditorium and ordered everyone to leave.</li>
<li>The superintendent, McCarthy, had called the police because he found the talk inflammatory.</li>
<li>Gatto was escorted from the building.</li>
<li>An evening talk for parents was also canceled.</li>
<li>The local newspaper reported the incident but omitted the police involvement.</li>
<li>The superintendent claimed Gatto showed a “violent film,” which was untrue.</li>
<li>Gatto sent letters to school officials and the student newspaper requesting their perspectives, but received no response.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> April 1991</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Walden, Vermont</li>
<li><strong>Summary:</strong> The state of Vermont forced the closure of four one-room schoolhouses despite local opposition.</li>
<li><strong>Details:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Walden had four well-regarded one-room schools with above-average academic performance.</li>
<li>The state threatened to withhold funding and seize the schools through eminent domain if they were not made handicap accessible, claiming exorbitant costs.</li>
<li>Gatto visited and was impressed by the schools and the students.</li>
<li>An architect confirmed that the state’s cost estimates were highly inflated.</li>
<li>The architect refused to testify, fearing retribution from the state.</li>
<li>Gatto spoke at a town meeting, but fear of the state’s threats led to the bond issue passing.</li>
