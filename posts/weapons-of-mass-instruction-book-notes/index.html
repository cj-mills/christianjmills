<ul>
<li>John Taylor Gatto argues that compulsory schooling is designed to make students bored, childish, and conformist, serving the interests of corporations and governments rather than the students themselves.</li>
<li>He traces the origins of this system to Prussia and influential figures like Horace Mann and James Bryant Conant.</li>
<li>The real purposes of mandatory schooling are to create obedient workers and consumers, prevent the lower classes from uniting, and maintain a manageable population.</li>
<li>Despite this, Gatto believes that children have immense potential and that the tricks of compulsory schooling can be avoided by encouraging critical thinking, independence, and a rich inner life.</li>

<li><p>Gatto, a former teacher, found that both students and teachers in compulsory schools are bored.</p></li>
<li><p>Students complain that the work is meaningless and that they want to do something real. Teachers blame the students for being rude and uninterested.</p></li>
<li><p>Gatto argues that we are all to blame for this boredom, and that it is a childish attitude that should be avoided. His grandfather taught him this lesson at a young age.</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“He told me that I was never to use that term in his presence again, that if I was bored it was my fault and no one else’s. The obligation to amuse and instruct myself was entirely my own, and people who didn’t know that were childish people to be avoided if possible, certainly not to be trusted.”</p>

<ul>
<li>Gatto argues that the real purposes of compulsory schooling are different from the stated goals of creating good people, citizens, and helping each person reach their potential.</li>
<li>He cites influential figures like H.L. Mencken, William James, and Orestes Brownson, who argued that American schooling was based on the Prussian system, which was designed to create mediocre intellects and manageable citizens.</li>
<li>Harvard president James Bryant Conant and education theorist Alexander Inglis played key roles in shaping modern compulsory schooling to serve these ends.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The Adjustive or Adaptive Function:</strong> To establish fixed habits of reaction to authority, precluding critical judgment.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>The Integrating Function:</strong> To make children as alike as possible, conforming to authority.</li>
<li><strong>The Diagnostic and Directive Function:</strong> To determine each student’s proper social role and train them accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>The Differentiating Function:</strong> To sort children by role and limit their development to what is deemed appropriate for their destination in the social machine.</li>
<li><strong>The Selective Function:</strong> To tag the unfit with poor grades and remedial placement, ensuring that they are accepted as inferior and prevented from reproducing.</li>
<li><strong>The Propaedeutic Function:</strong> To teach a small fraction of kids how to manage and control a deliberately dumbed-down population.</li>

<li>Gatto argues that mandatory schooling serves the interests of corporations and governments by creating a servile labor force, a harmless electorate, and a population of mindless consumers.</li>
<li>Industrial titans like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller recognized the potential of public education to serve these ends.</li>
<li>President Woodrow Wilson openly advocated for a two-tiered education system, with one class receiving a liberal education and a much larger class being fitted for specific, difficult manual tasks.</li>

<ul>
<li>Compulsory schooling in the US was established in the late 19th/early 20th century, driven by industrialists and financiers rather than public demand. The goal was to produce obedient workers and curb independent thinking.</li>
<li>Over the 20th century, literacy rates declined dramatically despite increased schooling. Gatto argues this is the intentional result of new teaching methods focused on memorization rather than comprehension.</li>
<li>True education has been replaced by schooling aimed at creating “human resources” for big business and government. Independent learning has been stifled in favor of conformity and subordination.</li>
<li>Alternative models of open-source, self-directed learning have consistently produced remarkable individuals. Forced schooling prevents young people from reaching their full potential.</li>

<li>Industrialists like Rockefeller and Carnegie</li>
<li>A goal of “scientific population control” and eliminating independent family/cultural influences</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Number of school boards consolidated from 135,000 to 15,000, reducing local control</li>

<p>In chapter 4, Gatto writes a candid letter to his assistant principal, Murray in Manhattan’s School District 3, exposing the flaws and failings of the compulsory schooling system. He argues that schools are designed to weaken children’s minds, suppress their imagination, and give them bad characters, while maintaining a facade of high expectations and sanctimony.

<p>In chapter 6, Gatto discusses the negative effects of television and computers on children’s behavior and development. He argues that these media steal time from children to write their own stories and engage in real-life experiences, leading to a loss of integrity and purpose. Gatto proposes a solution based on the medieval pilgrimage road, the Camino de Santiago, which involves sending students on expeditions to explore the world around them and engage in meaningful intellectual work.</p>
