<section id="boredom-and-childishness-in-school" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="boredom-and-childishness-in-school">Boredom and Childishness in School</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto, a teacher for 30 years, observed pervasive boredom in schools, among both students and teachers.</li>
<li><strong>Students</strong> found schoolwork meaningless and dull, desiring more engaging and practical learning experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Teachers</strong>, equally bored, often blamed students’ lack of motivation and the rigid school structures.</li>
<li>Gatto argues that this widespread boredom is a systemic issue, not simply a matter of individual fault.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="personal-experiences-and-observations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="personal-experiences-and-observations">Personal Experiences and Observations</h3>
<ul>
<li>At age 7, Gatto complained of boredom to his grandfather
<ul>
<li><strong>Grandfather’s response:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hit him on the head</li>
<li>Forbade use of the term “boredom” in his presence</li>
<li>Taught that boredom is one’s own fault</li>
<li>Obligation to amuse and instruct oneself</li>
<li>People who don’t understand this are childish and untrustworthy</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This lesson cured Gatto of boredom permanently</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite attempting to instill this lesson in his students, Gatto found it challenging to combat the ingrained belief that boredom is inherent to the classroom.</li>
<li>His efforts to break free from conventional teaching methods were met with resistance and even retaliation from the school system.</li>
<li>This experience solidified Gatto’s view of schools as “factories of childishness”, suppressing natural curiosity and a thirst for knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<section id="a-better-way-to-learn" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-better-way-to-learn">A Better Way to Learn</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto believes a more effective and engaging education is possible.</li>
<li>He proposes a system that:
<ul>
<li>Offers flexibility in time, curriculum, and assessment.</li>
<li>Connects students with knowledgeable and passionate mentors.</li>
<li>Grants students autonomy and encourages risk-taking.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="questioning-the-necessity-of-school" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="questioning-the-necessity-of-school">Questioning the Necessity of School</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto challenges the assumption that the current compulsory schooling system is necessary.</li>
<li>He questions the effectiveness of the traditional 12-year model, citing examples of successful individuals throughout history who thrived without formal schooling:
<ul>
<li>George Washington</li>
<li>Benjamin Franklin</li>
<li>Thomas Jefferson</li>
<li>Abraham Lincoln</li>
<li>Admiral Farragut</li>
<li>Thomas Edison</li>
<li>Andrew Carnegie</li>
<li>John D. Rockefeller</li>
<li>Herman Melville</li>
<li>Mark Twain</li>
<li>Joseph Conrad</li>
<li>Margaret Mead</li>
<li>Ariel Durant (married at 15, co-authored a multi-volume world history)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He argues that equating success solely with formal schooling is a misconception.</li>

<section id="the-true-purpose-of-public-schools" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-true-purpose-of-public-schools">The True Purpose of Public Schools</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto proposes that the real purpose of compulsory schooling deviates significantly from the commonly stated goals of creating good people, good citizens, and fostering individual potential.</li>
<li>He argues that the current system, with roots in 19th-century Prussia, aims to:
<ul>
<li>Create a manageable and obedient workforce.</li>
<li>Suppress dissent and originality.</li>
<li>Condition students into becoming unquestioning consumers.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<section id="evidence-and-support" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evidence-and-support">Evidence and Support</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>H.L. Mencken (The American Mercury, April 1924):</strong> Argued that public education’s true aim is to standardize citizens, stifle dissent, and discourage independent thought.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Precedence:</strong> Gatto points to the Prussian education system as the model for the American system, designed to produce a compliant populace and workforce.
<ul>
<li><strong>William James:</strong> Alluded to the Prussian influence on American schools.</li>
<li><strong>Orestes Brownson:</strong> Denounced the “Prussianization” of American schools in the 1840s.</li>
<li><strong>Horace Mann (1853):</strong> In his seventh annual report to the Massachusetts Board of Education, he advocated for adopting the Prussian model.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Alexander Inglis (Principles of Secondary Education, 1918):</strong> Outlined six basic functions of compulsory schooling, revealing its intention to mold students into obedient and standardized citizens, categorize them for predetermined social roles, and perpetuate a system that benefits the ruling class.
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Adjustive or Adaptive Function:</strong> Condition students to blindly obey authority.</li>
<li><strong>Integrating Function:</strong> Promote conformity and predictability.</li>
<li><strong>Diagnostic and Directive Function:</strong> Determine and assign social roles.</li>
<li><strong>Differentiating Function:</strong> Train students according to their designated roles.</li>
<li><strong>Selective Function:</strong> Identify and weed out the “unfit” through grades and placement.</li>
<li><strong>Propedeutic Function:</strong> Cultivate an elite group to manage the system.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-role-of-influential-figures">The Role of Influential Figures</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>James Bryant Conant (President of Harvard, influential figure in 20th-century education):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Advocated for standardized testing and large, impersonal high schools.</li>
<li>In his essay <em>The Child, the Parent, and the State</em> (1959), he acknowledged a deliberate “revolution” in schooling between 1905 and 1930.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Promoters of Mandatory Schooling:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>George Peabody:</strong> Financier who supported mandatory schooling in the South, likely understanding its role in creating a compliant workforce and consumer base.</li>
<li><strong>Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller:</strong> Industrialists who recognized the economic benefits of a mass-educated, consumerist society.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Elwood P. Cumberley (Public Education in the United States, 1934):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Described schools as “factories” shaping children according to predetermined specifications.</li>
<li>Highlighted how mandatory schooling extended childhood and promoted consumerism.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Woodrow Wilson (President of Princeton University, 1909):</strong> Advocated for different education systems for different classes, limiting opportunities for the lower classes.
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“We want one class of persons to have a liberal education, and we want another class of persons, a very much larger class of necessity in every society, to forego the privileges of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks.”</p>

<ul>
<li>Gatto contends that the current education system has created a society of perpetual children, characterized by:
<ul>
<li>A diminished capacity for critical thinking and independent judgment.</li>
<li>A reliance on external validation and entertainment.</li>
<li>A susceptibility to manipulation by marketing and political rhetoric.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto urges parents to recognize the true nature of the school system and take control of their children’s education.</li>
<li>He encourages parents to:
<ul>
<li>Foster critical thinking, independence, and a love of learning.</li>
<li>Provide a rich and challenging curriculum that schools often neglect.</li>
<li>Encourage solitude and introspection to develop inner strength and self-reliance.</li>
<li>Resist the pressure to conform to a system that prioritizes obedience over true intellectual development.</li>

<ul>
<li>In 1909, a factory inspector surveyed 500 children working in 20 factories and discovered that 412 of them preferred the terrible factory conditions to returning to school.
<ul>

<li>Helen Todd received various reasons from children for favoring factory work, including:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Monetary Factors:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Being paid for the factory work they do.</li>
<li>The ability to support their families financially, afford more food, shoes for babies, and other basic needs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Difficulty and Relevance of Schoolwork:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Perceived difficulty in understanding schoolwork compared to factory work.</li>
<li>Learning being perceived as hard.</li>
<li>Some children feeling unable to learn.</li>
<li>Perception that school education is not relevant to their ability to earn.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Environment at School and Factory:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Preference for the factory environment as there is less judgment compared to school.</li>
<li>The factory environment doesn’t involve name-calling or bullying as in school.</li>
<li>They can avoid the corporal punishment experienced at school for:
<ul>
<li>Failure to learn</li>
<li>Whispering</li>
<li>Having string in their pocket</li>
<li>Squeaky seats</li>
<li>Late arrival</li>
<li>Forgetting pages of the book</li>
</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Professor Arthur Calhoun’s 1919 book, <em>Social History of the Family</em>, announced a profound shift occurring in America’s schools, with children being transferred from their families to the custody of community experts. (page 175)

</ul></li>
<li>Calhoun believed this change fulfilled the utopian dream of Darwin and Galton: scientific population control through public education to prevent the “unfit” from reproducing. (page 331)</li>
<li>This agenda, implemented without public oversight, raised concerns about an “invisible government” controlling schools.</li>
<li>Mayor John Hyland of New York City, in 1922, claimed that the city’s schools had been “seized by tentacles of an invisible government,” echoing British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli’s earlier pronouncements about a secretive ruling power.</li>
<li>Hyland specifically identified the Rockefeller Foundation as the controlling force in education.</li>
<li>By 1928, <em>A Sociological Philosophy of Education</em> asserted that teachers were responsible for “running not merely schools, but the world.”

<li>Edward Thorndyke, a professor at the Rockefeller-funded Columbia Teachers College and the founder of educational psychology, declared in 1929 that “academic subjects are of little value.”</li>
<li>His colleague, William Kilpatrick, argued in his book <em>Education and the Social Crisis</em> that child-rearing should be controlled by experts, as family was a “retrograde institution.”</li>

<section id="the-control-of-human-behavior" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-control-of-human-behavior">The Control of Human Behavior</h4>
<ul>
<li>On April 11, 1933, Max Mason, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, unveiled a national program, supported by the foundation, to control human behavior, with schools playing a central role.

</ul></li>
<li>Influenced by Eastern European geneticist Max Muller, the Rockefeller Foundation invested heavily in controlling human evolution.</li>
<li>Muller’s research on mutations in fruit flies using X-rays suggested the possibility of scientifically controlling all life.</li>
<li>Like Darwin and Galton before him, Muller believed that planned human breeding was the key to a utopian society.</li>
<li>His ideas were embraced by prominent scientists and powerful economic interests.</li>
<li>Muller, who later won the Nobel Prize, outlined his plan in a 1,500-word manifesto signed by 22 renowned American and British biologists.</li>
<li>The manifesto advocated for state intervention to separate “worthwhile breeding stock” from the “evolutionary dead-end material.”</li>
<li>This manifesto, advocating for eugenics, marked a shift from private discussions in the 1870s to public discourse, at least among influential figures.</li>
<li>F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel <em>The Great Gatsby</em> alludes to this movement away from democratic egalitarian ideals.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-post-war-transformation-of-schools">The Post-War Transformation of Schools</h4>
<ul>
<li>World War II drove the eugenics movement underground, but it continued to advance.</li>
<li>After the war, a battle erupted within education between traditionalists advocating for basic literacy and numeracy skills and proponents of a more scientific and socially engineered approach, primarily funded by corporate foundations like Carnegie and Rockefeller.</li>
<li>Two congressional investigations, in 1915 and 1959, concluded that school policy was being shaped by corporate interests without public oversight, but these reports were largely ignored.</li>
<li>Between 1967 and 1974, teacher training underwent a radical transformation driven by private foundations, universities, think tanks, government agencies, and corporations.</li>
<li>This transformation was coordinated through the U.S. Office of Education and key state education departments.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Designing Education for the Future:</strong> A government-led futurology project that redefined education as a means to achieve national economic and social goals, sidelining personal development. State education agencies were tasked with enforcing compliance with federal directives.

<li><strong>The Behavioral Science Teacher Education Project (BSTEP):</strong> A project outlining government plans to use schools for social engineering, including manipulating public opinion, experimenting with chemicals on minors (foreshadowing the use of drugs like Ritalin and Adderall), and creating a society where a small elite holds all the power.

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="teachers-as-therapists">Teachers as Therapists</h4>
<ul>
<li>In the mid-to-late 1960s, school violence and chaos surged following a Ford Foundation policy requiring schools to adopt due process procedures for disciplining students.</li>
<li>This policy, intended to mirror the court system, rendered teachers and administrators powerless to maintain order effectively.</li>
<li>The slow and deliberate nature of due process proved inadequate in addressing immediate student misconduct.</li>
<li>Deprived of traditional disciplinary methods, classrooms descended into chaos, with students realizing that teachers were unable to intervene effectively.</li>
<li>The Behavioral Science Teacher Education Project, coinciding with this period of heightened violence, called for training teachers as “therapist,” tasked with applying social psychology principles to manage student behavior.</li>
<li>This shift redefined both curriculum and teaching, prioritizing psychological manipulation over academic instruction.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-hidden-history-of-school-funding">The Hidden History of School Funding</h3>
<ul>
<li>From 1896 to 1920, private industrialists and financiers, through their foundations, heavily funded university positions, research, and school administration, surpassing government spending on education.</li>
<li>Two individuals alone, Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, outspent the government on education as late as 1915.</li>
<li>This privately driven system of education was established without public input or awareness.</li>
<li>The motives behind this funding were complex, but the Rockefeller General Education Board’s stated mission provides insight.</li>
<li>In their 1906 document <em>Occasional Letter No.&nbsp;1</em>, the board stated:
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“In our dreams, people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hands. The present educational conventions of intellectual and moral education fade from our minds, and unhampered by tradition we work our own goodwill upon a grateful and responsive folk. We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning or men of science. We have not to raise up from among them authors, educators, poets, or men of letters. We shall not search for embryo great artists, painters, musicians, nor lawyers, doctors, preachers, politicians, statesmen, of whom we have ample supply. The task we set before ourselves is very simple. We will organize children and teach them to do in a perfect way the things their fathers and mothers are doing in an imperfect way.”</p>

<ul>
<li>At the start of World War II, millions of men underwent academic testing for military service.</li>
<li>From 1942 to 1944, 18 million men were tested, with 96% deemed literate enough (possessing a fourth-grade reading level) to serve as soldiers, a slight decline from the 98% literacy rate a decade earlier.</li>
<li>However, by the Korean War in the early 1950s, 600,000 men were rejected, and the literacy rate had plummeted to 81%, despite these men having more years of schooling and supposedly better teachers and materials.</li>
<li>By the Vietnam War in the mid-1960s, the illiteracy rate had skyrocketed to 27%, with only 73% possessing basic literacy skills, and many of those struggling to comprehend even a newspaper.</li>

<ul>
<li>In 1940, the literacy rate was 96% for whites and 80% for blacks.</li>
<li>Six decades later, despite a 350% increase in education spending, the Adult Literacy Survey and the National Assessment of Educational Progress reported a staggering 40% illiteracy rate among blacks and 17% among whites.</li>
<li>Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein’s controversial book <em>The Bell Curve</em> attributed this disparity to genetics, arguing that intelligence is hereditary.</li>
<li>However, this theory is challenged by data from South Africa, where black violence rates were significantly lower than in the U.S. despite similar population sizes, and Jamaica, which boasts a 98.5% literacy rate, surpassing that of American whites.</li>

<li>While white families often maintained traditional reading practices at home, providing a safety net, black families, historically denied access to literacy during slavery and Jim Crow, lacked this advantage.</li>
<li>The Army, alarmed by the declining literacy rates, investigated the issue in 1952 and discovered that the problem lay in flawed reading instruction methods.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-hegelian-influence-on-american-education">The Hegelian Influence on American Education</h3>
<ul>
<li>William Torrey Harris, U.S. Commissioner of Education from 1889 to 1906, played a pivotal role in shaping American education.</li>
<li>A prominent Hegelian philosopher and editor of the <em>Journal of Speculative Philosophy</em>, Harris standardized and Germanized the U.S. education system.</li>
<li>Contrary to his portrayal as a defender of classical education, Harris held radical views, believing that children were property of the state.</li>
<li>A close friend of Andrew Carnegie, Harris shared Carnegie’s vision of a society where work and education were intertwined from cradle to grave.</li>
<li>Hegel, a Prussian philosopher whose ideas influenced both Karl Marx and J.P. Morgan, taught that history could be manipulated by creating crises to justify centralized control.</li>
<li>Harris and his associates, known as the St.&nbsp;Louis Hegelians, aimed to create a utopian society by ending dissent and establishing a rigid social order.</li>
</ul>
<section id="the-goal-psychological-alienation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-goal-psychological-alienation">The Goal: Psychological Alienation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Harris believed that achieving this utopian vision required psychologically alienating children from their families, traditions, religions, and cultures, leaving the state as the sole authority.</li>
<li>In his 1906 work <em>The Philosophy of Education</em>, Harris wrote:
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Ninety-nine students out of a hundred are automata, careful to walk in prescribed paths, careful to follow the prescribed custom. This is not an accident but the result of substantial education which, scientifically defined, is the subsumption of the individual.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>He further argued that:
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The great purpose of school, self-alienation, can be realized better in dark, airless, ugly places. It is to master the physical self, to transcend the beauty of nature. School should develop the power to withdraw from the external world.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Harris saw self-alienation as essential for preparing individuals for a life of mindless labor in an industrial capitalist society, where personal fulfillment is secondary to economic productivity.</li>
<li>This system encourages conformity and discourages critical thinking, creating a workforce that is easily controlled.</li>

<li><strong>Ideological Control:</strong> Schools provided a means to instill loyalty to specific ideas and attitudes, ensuring a compliant workforce.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-erosion-of-american-ingenuity">The Erosion of American Ingenuity:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Forced schooling marked a departure from America’s early open-source learning environment, which fostered self-reliance, ingenuity, and entrepreneurial spirit.</li>
<li>This shift from production to consumption, from active to passive learning, stifled innovation and creativity.</li>
<li>By the late 19th century, education was viewed as a branch of industry, with students as products to be shaped for the workforce.</li>
<li>In a 1909 speech to businessmen, Woodrow Wilson stated:
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“We want one class to have a liberal education. We want another class, a very much larger class of necessity, to forego the privilege of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific, difficult manual tasks.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>

<li>One significant factor driving the push for forced schooling was the fear of “overproduction,” a concept still relevant today, often referred to as “overcapacity.”</li>
<li>Overproduction occurs when the supply of goods and services exceeds demand, leading to falling prices and economic instability.</li>
<li>In the 19th century, America’s independent and resourceful population, fueled by an open-source learning environment and a culture of innovation, frequently led to overproduction.</li>

<li>The essay read:
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Government schooling is the most radical adventure in history. It kills the family by monopolizing the best times of childhood and by teaching disrespect for home and parents. The whole blueprint of school procedure is Egyptian, not Greek or Roman. It grows from the theological idea that human value is a scarce thing, represented symbolically by the narrow peak of a pyramid. That idea passed into American history through the Puritans. It found its scientific presentation in the bell curve, along which talent supposedly apportions itself by some iron law of biology. It’s a religious notion, and school is its church. I offer rituals to keep heresy at bay. I provide documentation to justify the heavenly pyramid. Socrates foresaw that if teaching became a formal profession, something like this would happen. Professional interest is served by making what is easy to do seem hard, by subordinating the laity to the priesthood. School is too vital a jobs project, contract giver, and protector of the social order, to allow itself to be reformed. It has political allies to guard its marches. That’s why reforms come and go without altering much. Even reformers can’t imagine school being much different. David learns to read at age four. Rachel at age nine. In normal development, when both are thirteen, you can’t tell which one learned first. The five-year spread means nothing at all. But in school, I label Rachel learning disabled and slow David down a bit, too. For a paycheck, I teach David to depend on me to tell him when to go and stop. He won’t outgrow that dependency. I identify Rachel as discount merchandise, special education fodder. She’ll be locked in her place forever. In 30 years of teaching kids, rich and poor, I almost never met a learning disabled child. Hardly ever met a gifted and talented one either. Like all school categories, these are sacred myths created by human imagination. They derive from questionable values that we never examine because they preserve the temple of schooling. That’s the secret behind short answer tests, bells, uniform time blocks, age grading, standardization, and all the rest of the school religion punishing our nation. There isn’t a right way to become educated. There are as many ways as there are fingerprints. We don’t need state-certified teachers to make education happen. Certification probably guarantees it won’t. How much more evidence is necessary? Good schools don’t need more money or a longer year. They need real free market choices. Variety that speaks to every need and runs risks We don’t need a national curriculum or national testing either Both initiatives arise from ignorance of how people learn Or deliberate indifference to it I can’t teach this way any longer If you hear of a job where I don’t have to hurt kids to make a living Let me know Come fall, I’ll be looking for work”</p>

<ul>
<li>Gatto introduces Hector Rodriguez, a 13-year-old student he encountered while teaching.</li>
<li>Hector is described as small, olive-skinned, with large black eyes.</li>
<li>Gatto first truly <em>saw</em> Hector at a skating rink, where the boy was attempting to bypass the gate despite having a paid ticket.</li>
<li>Hector, it turned out, was conducting an experiment to see if he could outsmart the turnstile.</li>

<ul>
<li>Examining Hector’s school records, Gatto discovered a history of minor infractions that painted the boy as a troublemaker.</li>
<li>These incidents, while insignificant in the past, now contributed to a narrative that labeled Hector as a problem.</li>
<li>Hector attended one of the lowest-rated schools in New York State, placed in a low-ranking class within his grade.</li>
<li>Gatto criticizes the rigid five-tier academic ranking system (Gifted and Talented Honors, Gifted and Talented, Special Progress, Mainstream, and Special Ed) that labeled and segregated students.</li>
<li>He notes the financial incentive for schools to identify students as needing Special Ed services, creating a perverse motivation to overdiagnose.</li>
<li>Hector, labeled “Mainstream D,” narrowly avoided the stigma of Special Ed.</li>
<li>His standardized test scores placed him far behind his peers.</li>

<ul>
<li>As a teacher, Gatto observed that children who watched excessive television exhibited negative behavioral patterns:
<ul>
<li>Irresponsibility</li>
<li>Childishness</li>
<li>Dishonesty</li>
<li>Malice towards peers</li>
<li>Lack of purpose</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Stifles children’s ability to develop integrity and maturity</li>
<li>Inhibits their capacity for original thought and creativity</li>
<li>Mirrors the negative effects of traditional schooling by suppressing their spirits</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Computers, while potentially offering interactivity, often worsen the issue:
<ul>
<li>Many users engage in passive activities like watching pornography or playing games against computers</li>
<li>The internet, without discipline, easily enables passive consumption</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto theorizes that the solution lies in encouraging physical activity and real-world experiences.</li>
<li>Excessive media consumption disrupts natural feedback loops crucial for learning and growth.</li>
<li>Examples of feedback loops in action:
<ul>
<li>Learning to sail: Beginners learn from their mistakes through the immediate feedback of the boat’s movement.</li>
<li>Mastering speech: Practice and feedback are essential for developing complex language skills.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bureaucracies, like school systems, often fail due to their inability to respond effectively to feedback.
<ul>
<li>Rigid rules and resistance to input from parents, teachers, students, and external sources hinder growth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto observed that rigidly structured schooling limits opportunities for students to learn through feedback.</li>
<li>Restoring natural feedback loops through real-world experiences was hypothesized to mitigate the negative effects of media overconsumption.</li>

<li>Gatto revisits the issue of curriculum irrelevance, citing Langdon Winner’s book <em>Autonomous Technology</em>, which argues that modern society is characterized by a profound disconnect between individuals and the technologies they depend on.</li>
<li>Winner contends that people are unable to understand, explain, or control the complex systems that shape their lives, leading to a state of dependence and bewilderment.</li>
<li>Gatto argues that school, rather than equipping students with the skills and knowledge to navigate this complexity, reinforces conformity, obedience, and a reliance on external authorities.</li>
<li>He criticizes the emphasis on winning over learning, arguing that it undermines genuine intellectual development and critical thinking.</li>

<li>Gatto points to the growing homeschooling movement and the increasing dropout rates as evidence of a growing dissatisfaction with the current system.</li>
<li>He concludes by emphasizing that true education requires questioning assumptions, challenging authority, and engaging in independent thought, qualities discouraged by the traditional school system.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>In a 1940 speech, journalist and political philosopher Walter Lippmann argued that modern education was destroying Western civilization.</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“During the past 40 or 50 years, those who are responsible for education have progressively removed from the curriculum the Western culture which produced the modern democratic state.

<li><p>Lippmann believed that by removing Western culture from the curriculum, schools were depriving students of the “premises, the rationale, the logic, the methods, the values of the deposited wisdom which are the genius of the development of Western civilization.”</p></li>

<li>The lack of student voice in discussions about their own education</li>
<li>The use of a simplified, “baudelarized” version of Homer’s <em>Odyssey</em></li>

<ul>
<li>German philosopher Immanuel Kant posed four fundamental questions in education:
<ul>
<li>What can I know?</li>
<li>What may I hope?</li>
<li>What ought I to do?</li>
<li>What is man?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ironically, the German education system that emerged stifled philosophical curiosity and spread globally.</li>
<li>American compulsory schooling, heavily influenced by the German model, is not a homegrown product and doesn’t primarily focus on transmitting basic skills.

<li><strong>Reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/06017777/">Horace Mann’s Seventh Letter to the Boston School Committee</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Grappling with Kant’s questions is crucial for developing a meaningful curriculum.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fear of Stagnation:</strong> Gatto expressed concern that schools in 2000 would resemble those of 1990 and 1890, indicating a lack of progress.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Contrast:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Education in 1790 America differed significantly:
<ul>
<li>Schooling was voluntary and shorter in duration.</li>
<li>It didn’t dominate a child’s time or interfere with family life.</li>
<li>Indoctrination was less prevalent.</li>
<li>Literacy rates were higher in some cases, like Massachusetts, compared to the compulsory system.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Barriers to Change:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Political systems often hinder educational reform due to vested interests.</li>
<li>Schools represent lucrative contracts and job opportunities, creating resistance to change.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hope for the Future:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A nationwide debate on the definition of an educated person is necessary.</li>
<li>This definition should outline valuable human competencies that schools must foster.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Characteristics of Educated Individuals:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Comfortable with solitude and time management.</li>
<li>Capable of forming healthy relationships.</li>
<li>Aware of their mortality and the importance of lifelong learning.</li>
<li>Possess a strong sense of personal values while respecting diverse perspectives.</li>
<li>Creative, resourceful, and adaptable.</li>
<li>Understand the balance between material wealth and intangible values like love, curiosity, reverence, and empathy.</li>
<li>Seek variety and balance it with home and responsibilities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>A Curriculum for Life:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Education should address fundamental life passages:
<ul>
<li><strong>Birth and Self-Discovery:</strong> Understanding one’s origins, family, and cultural influences.</li>
<li><strong>The Physical World:</strong> Exploration and analysis of the natural environment.</li>
<li><strong>Human Relationships:</strong> Navigating the complexities of family, friendships, love, and community.</li>
<li><strong>Vocation:</strong> Finding purpose and contributing to society through work.</li>
<li><strong>Maturity and Independence:</strong> Embracing the responsibilities of adulthood.</li>
<li><strong>Death and Legacy:</strong> Contemplating mortality and leaving a positive impact on future generations.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Breaking Free from Institutional Confinement:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Education should extend beyond the confines of traditional schools.</li>
<li>It should occur in diverse settings, embracing the richness of real-world experiences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Perils of Standardized Testing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Standardized tests prioritize scores over genuine learning and personal growth.</li>
<li>They fail to accurately predict real-world success.</li>
<li>High test scores are often achieved through memorization and test-taking strategies rather than deep understanding.</li>
<li>Testing promotes dishonesty and a narrow focus on specific skills.</li>
<li>It creates unnecessary anxiety and pressure on students.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Example of Reading:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Learning to read is relatively simple when approached naturally.</li>
<li>Traditional methods often create aversion to reading by emphasizing pressure, ranking, and standardized assessments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>A Vision for a New School:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Decentralized and accessible learning opportunities in various locations.</li>
<li>Open to all individuals, regardless of age or background.</li>
<li>Utilizing technology and the internet to facilitate learning.</li>
<li>Empowering individuals to take control of their education.</li>
<li>Shifting funding and control away from centralized institutions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Embracing Flexibility:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Flexible schedules, learning environments, and study options to accommodate individual needs and learning styles.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Power of Imagination:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nurturing imagination is crucial for innovation and progress.</li>
<li>Standardized testing stifles creativity and independent thinking.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Less is More:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Effective education often requires less formal schooling, personnel, and materials.</li>
<li>It emphasizes real-world experiences and community involvement.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bottom-Up Reform:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Meaningful change is more likely to originate from individuals and communities than from top-down mandates.</li>
<li>Parents, students, and teachers must challenge the status quo and seek alternative approaches.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenging Conventional Wisdom:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto challenges the notion that a more complex world necessitates more schooling and testing.</li>
<li>He argues that real-world learning often occurs outside of formal educational settings.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Analogy of Driving:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Learning to drive is a complex skill acquired through experience and practice, not formal schooling.</li>
<li>Similarly, many essential life skills are learned through self-directed exploration and real-world challenges.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>A Call to Action:</strong>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-nation-trapped-in-a-labyrinth">A Nation Trapped in a Labyrinth</h3>
<ul>
<li>Both Gatto’s granddaughter and the nation are trapped in a system created by previous generations.
<ul>
<li>This system is beyond the reach of traditional schooling to fix.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Social unrest</strong> and a <strong>loss of faith</strong> in American leadership are prevalent due to a <strong>unilateral reorganization of work</strong>.
<ul>
<li>This reorganization is orchestrated by <strong>large employers</strong> who hold significant influence over the government.</li>
<li><strong>Elite universities</strong> like Harvard and Dartmouth are complicit in designing and promoting this system.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This new work structure prioritizes corporate profits over the well-being of workers.
<ul>
<li><strong>Exportation of American jobs</strong> and <strong>importation of foreign workers</strong> are used to maximize profits.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-billionaires</strong> like Bill Gates are at the forefront of this movement.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Contingent labor</strong> is another symptom of this system.
<ul>
<li>Companies hire temporary workers to avoid providing benefits and job security.</li>
<li>This creates a <strong>national proletariat</strong> with no stability, unable to plan for the future.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lean production</strong>, another harmful idea stemming from this system, further dehumanizes workers.
<ul>
<li><strong>Compassion</strong> is absent as companies prioritize squeezing maximum output from a bare-bones workforce.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This reorganization of work has led to the widening <strong>gap between the rich and poor</strong> in America.
<ul>
<li>The middle class is eroding, the working class is suffering, and the safety net for the poor is gone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto believes that <strong>political action</strong>, not education, is the only way to combat these systemic issues.</li>

<section id="the-new-atlantis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-new-atlantis">The New Atlantis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto argues that modern colleges have become training grounds for corporate and government work, rather than places of true learning.
<ul>
<li>He believes this transformation began after World War II and was influenced by Francis Bacon’s utopian work, <em>The New Atlantis</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>According to Gatto, Bacon’s vision of a world university promotes social control and reinforces existing power structures.
<ul>
<li>He argues that this model has led to increased surveillance, the suppression of dissent, and the erosion of traditional values.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto criticizes the “lean production” model of modern workplaces, which he believes prioritizes efficiency over compassion and has contributed to the growing gap between the rich and the poor.</li>
<li>He concludes by emphasizing the need for political action to address the social and economic problems facing the United States.
<ul>
<li>He believes that education alone is not enough to solve these problems and that systemic change is necessary.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="incident-at-nuremberg">Incident at Nuremberg</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> January 29, 2008</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Nuremberg, Germany</li>
<li><strong>Incident:</strong> 16-year-old Melissa Busekros was forcibly removed from her home by 15 police officers and city officials.
<ul>
<li><strong>Her crime:</strong> homeschooling.</li>
<li>Melissa was placed under psychiatric investigation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Author’s Response and Historical Context:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto, upon hearing of the incident, wrote to the German ambassador in Washington expressing his disgust and inquiring why Germany still enforces a homeschooling ban enacted by the Nazi government in 1937.</li>
<li>Gatto highlights the irony of Germany’s stance, given that 2.5 to 3 million American students are homeschooled, including prominent figures like the head of the Human Genome Project.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Court Order and Interrogation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto criticizes the court order authorizing Melissa’s apprehension, which allowed the use of force and deemed police intervention necessary despite no history suggesting such measures were warranted.</li>
<li>Melissa endured a 240-minute interrogation at a psychiatric clinic, focusing on her reasons for homeschooling.</li>
<li>The interrogation concluded that Melissa suffered from “school phobia,” a diagnosis Gatto deems pseudoscientific.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Justification for Intervention:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Based on the “school phobia” diagnosis, authorities declared an emergency, claiming Melissa’s development was delayed by a year and that immediate separation from her family was necessary.</li>
<li>Gatto questions the reasoning, philosophy, and values behind this action, deeming it illogical and extreme.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Police Raid and Official Statements:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Two days after the interrogation, 15 police officers, accompanied by a judge and state youth staff, raided the Busekros home.</li>
<li>Gatto sarcastically questions whether media reporters were present to document the event.</li>
<li>The court absolved Gattoities of responsibility, attributing the forced escort to the parents’ “illegal conduct” of homeschooling.</li>
<li>The German Education Authority stated it would not recognize homeschooling and would act “proportionately” to enforce this stance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Author’s Concerns and Historical Parallels:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto criticizes the excessive police presence as disproportionate to the situation.</li>
<li>He expresses concern over the Education Authority’s statement about bringing the family’s “convictions” in line, drawing parallels to Germany’s dark history of persecution during the witch hunts and Nazi era.</li>
<li>Gatto, with German ancestry, expresses alarm at what he perceives as a resurgence of “German madness” symbolized by the treatment of Melissa.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Influence of Compulsory Schooling:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto cites prominent Germans like Erich Maria Remarque and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who attributed Germany’s history of war and violence to its education system.</li>
<li>He argues that Germany’s obsession with system and order, stemming from compulsory schooling, has created a culture of obedience and conformity at the expense of individual liberty and creativity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Economic Consequences:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto contends that Germany’s rigid education system stifles innovation and economic competitiveness, citing the example of ThyssenKrupp’s Phoenix steel plant debacle.</li>
<li>He contrasts this with the flexibility and resourcefulness of Chinese workers, many of whom were homeschooled, who efficiently relocated and revitalized the Phoenix plant.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lack of Response and Author’s Conclusion:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto reveals he received no response to his letter from the German ambassador.</li>
<li>He concludes that the incident exposes a bureaucratic mindset unable to address legitimate concerns about individual rights and educational freedom.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> March 25, 2004</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Highland High School in Rockland County, New York</li>
<li><strong>Incident:</strong> Gatto was invited to speak at Highland High but his talk was interrupted by police, called by the superintendent, who deemed it inflammatory.</li>
<li><strong>Invitation to Speak:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto was invited to speak by school board member John Jankowicz.</li>
<li>Jankowicz, concerned about the negative effects of the school’s “Germanized” education system, sought Gatto’s perspective.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Observations of Highland High:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Arriving early, Gatto observed an atmosphere of affluence and self-satisfaction among the students, reminding him of another wealthy school he had visited.</li>
<li>He noted that beneath the surface of privilege, students were subject to intense pressure and anxiety regarding college admissions, perpetuating a culture of dishonesty and fear.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenging the School-to-College Pipeline:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto decided to address the students’ anxieties by exposing the reality of college admissions, challenging the school’s narrative about the importance of grades and test scores.</li>
<li>He highlighted the success of numerous high-profile individuals who achieved success without conforming to the traditional educational path.</li>
<li>He cited examples from the computer industry, literature, entertainment, and politics, demonstrating that dropouts and mediocre students often thrive.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exposing the Education System’s Hypocrisy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto presented data from The New York Times showing that educators themselves often scored poorly on standardized tests, with superintendents faring the worst.</li>
<li>He encouraged students to demand transparency from school officials, urging them to post their own grade and test records publicly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Revealing the Truth about College Admissions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto shared insights into the admissions policies of prestigious universities like Harvard, Stanford, and Yale, emphasizing that they prioritize applicants with unique experiences and accomplishments over perfect grades and test scores.</li>
<li>He encouraged students to pursue their passions and create their own paths to success, citing the example of high school dropout Richard Branson.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Student Response and Police Intervention:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The students responded positively to Gatto’s message, engaging with the information and questioning their assumptions about education.</li>
<li>However, the assembly was abruptly interrupted by a police detail who entered the auditorium and ordered everyone to leave.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Confrontation and Censorship:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The officer in charge approached Gatto and demanded he leave the room, ending the lecture.</li>
<li>Gatto complied, sensing the threat of arrest if he disobeyed.</li>
<li>It was later revealed that Superintendent McCarthy had called the police, deeming Gatto’s talk “inflammatory.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Aftermath and Reflections:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto emphasizes that his presentation was calm and factual, devoid of any provocative language or behavior.</li>
<li>He draws parallels between the censorship he experienced at Highland High and the suppression of homeschooling in Germany, highlighting a pattern of intolerance towards alternative educational perspectives.</li>

<li><strong>Location:</strong> Walden, Vermont</li>
<li><strong>Incident:</strong> The state of Vermont forced the closure of four one-room schoolhouses despite local opposition.</li>
<li><strong>The One-Room Schools of Walden, Vermont:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Until 1991, Walden, Vermont, had four one-room schoolhouses known for their idyllic setting, happy students, and above-average academic performance.</li>
<li>The community cherished these schools and actively supported them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Threat of Closure and State Intervention:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The state of Vermont threatened to close the one-room schools, claiming that bringing them up to code with federal disability access requirements was too expensive.</li>
<li>A plan was proposed to build a centralized regional school and bus students from a wide radius.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exposing Inflated Costs and Local Corruption:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto, upon reviewing the state’s proposal, found the estimated costs for renovating the one-room schools to be exorbitantly high.</li>
<li>He consulted with a renowned architect who confirmed that the estimates were ten times higher than the actual cost, suggesting a deliberate attempt to inflate the figures.</li>
<li>The architect revealed that the contract for the new regional school had likely already been promised to a specific firm, highlighting a corrupt system.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fear and Resignation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Despite Gatto’s efforts to expose the truth and rally support for the one-room schools, the community, worn down by the state’s threats and fearing the loss of funding, ultimately voted to approve the bond issue for the new school.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Loss of Unique Educational Opportunities:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto laments the closure of the one-room schools, viewing it as a loss of a valuable and effective educational model.</li>
