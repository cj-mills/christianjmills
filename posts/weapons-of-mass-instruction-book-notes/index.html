<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="boredom-in-the-classroom">Boredom in the Classroom</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Experience:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Taught for 30 years, observing pervasive boredom in schools.</li>
<li>Students found work stupid, meaningless, and unengaging.</li>
<li>Teachers were equally bored, blaming students’ lack of interest and focus on grades.</li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Grandfather’s Lesson:</strong> Boredom is the individual’s responsibility, not an external condition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Root of the Problem:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Schools perpetuate childishness by treating boredom and obedience as the norm.</li>
<li>Gatto observed that breaking free from these structures could foster curiosity, adventure, and resilience in students.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="questioning-the-system" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="questioning-the-system">Questioning the System</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>A System Functioning as Designed:</strong>
<ul>
<li>What if schools are intentionally designed to produce the observed outcomes?</li>
<li>Could the goal be to prevent genuine growth and maintain a controllable populace?</li>
<li>Is forced schooling truly necessary, especially considering successful individuals who thrived without it?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Historical Perspective:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Many accomplished figures throughout American history lacked formal schooling.</li>
<li>Formal schooling does not guarantee success.</li>
<li>Compulsory schooling became widespread in the US between 1905 and 1915.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><strong>Traditional Justifications (False):</strong>
<ul>
<li>To create good people.</li>
<li>To create good citizens.</li>
<li>To foster personal growth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Actual Purpose (Revealed):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>H. L. Mencken (The American Mercury, April 1924):</strong>
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The aim of public education is not to fill the young of the species with knowledge and awaken their intelligence… The aim is simply to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level, to breed and train a standardized citizenry, to put down dissent and originality.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Prussian Model:</strong>
<ul>
<li>American education is rooted in the Prussian system.</li>
<li>Designed to create a manageable populace through:
<ul>
<li>Mediocre intellect.</li>
<li>Suppression of individuality.</li>
<li>Limited leadership skills.</li>
<li>Docile and incomplete citizens.</li>

<li>The modern school system resulted from a deliberate revolution between 1905 and 1930 (as stated in “The Child, the Parent, and the State,” 1959).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Alexander Inglis’s “Principles of Secondary Education” (1918):</strong>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-factory-inspectors-survey-1909">The Factory Inspector’s Survey (1909)</h4>
<ul>
<li>A survey of 500 working children in 20 factories revealed that 412 of them preferred the harsh conditions of factory work to returning to school. (Source: Helen Todd, <em>Why Children Work</em>, McClure’s Magazine, April 1913)
<ul>
<li><strong>Archive:</strong> <a href="https://uofi.app.box.com/s/agtvym7n0hvf4qw2dr5d24txsgwrgc42">Why Children Work: The Children’s Answer By Helen M. Todd</a></li>
<li>Helen Todd received various reasons from children for favoring factory work, including:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Monetary Factors:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Being paid for the factory work they do.</li>
<li>The ability to support their families financially, afford more food, shoes for babies, and other basic needs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Difficulty and Relevance of Schoolwork:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Perceived difficulty in understanding schoolwork compared to factory work.</li>
<li>Learning being perceived as hard.</li>
<li>Some children feeling unable to learn.</li>
<li>Perception that school education is not relevant to their ability to earn.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Environment at School and Factory:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Preference for the factory environment as there is less judgment compared to school.</li>
<li>The factory environment doesn’t involve name-calling or bullying as in school.</li>
<li>They can avoid the corporal punishment experienced at school for:
<ul>
<li>Failure to learn</li>
<li>Whispering</li>
<li>Having string in their pocket</li>
<li>Squeaky seats</li>
<li>Late arrival</li>
<li>Forgetting pages of the book</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Implication:</strong> This finding challenges the conventional narrative that school is a universally desired and beneficial experience, suggesting that early schools were deeply flawed and potentially more unbearable than child labor.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-rise-of-the-experts-1919-1933">The Rise of the “Experts” (1919-1933)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Professor Arthur Calhoun</strong> (Social History of the Family, 1919) observed a shift from family-centered child rearing to a system where <strong>community experts</strong> increasingly controlled education. (page 175)
<ul>
<li>Calhoun believed this change aligned with the eugenics movement, promoting the idea of selective breeding and social control through education. (page 331)</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mayor John Hyland</strong> of New York City (1922) claimed that an “<strong>invisible government</strong>” had seized control of the city’s schools, likening the situation to an octopus capturing its prey.
<ul>
<li>Hyland pointed to the <strong>Rockefeller Foundation</strong> as a driving force behind this shift in power.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By 1928, <em>A Sociological Philosophy of Education</em> asserted that teachers were responsible for “running not merely schools, but the world.”
<ul>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Edward Thorndyke</strong> (Columbia Teachers College, 1929), a prominent figure in <strong>Educational Psychology</strong>, declared that traditional <strong>academic subjects are of little value</strong>.
<ul>
<li>This statement reflects a move away from traditional academic goals towards a focus on social engineering and behavioral conditioning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>William Kilpatrick</strong> (Columbia Teachers College, <em>Education and the Social Crisis</em>, 1929) advocated for expert control over child rearing, arguing that families were ill-equipped compared to trained professionals.
<ul>
<li>This perspective underscores the growing influence of a technocratic elite seeking to manage society through scientific methods.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Max Mason</strong>, President of the Rockefeller Foundation (April 11, 1933), announced a national program aimed at controlling human behavior, with schools playing a central role.
<ul>
<li>This announcement signaled an open embrace of social engineering as a primary goal of education.</li>
<li>The program drew inspiration from <strong>Max Muller</strong>, a geneticist who believed in the possibility of controlling human evolution through genetic manipulation.</li>

<section id="the-eugenics-connection" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-eugenics-connection">The Eugenics Connection</h4>
<ul>
<li>The influence of eugenics, a movement advocating for selective breeding to improve the human race, played a significant role in shaping early 20th-century education reform.
<ul>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> To separate “worthwhile breeding stock” from the “evolutionary dead-end material” (Source: Muller’s geneticist’s manifesto, signed by 22 prominent biologists).</li>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> This ideology promoted segregation and discrimination within the education system, reinforcing social hierarchies based on perceived intellectual ability and social worth.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-post-war-shift-from-education-to-indoctrination">The Post-War Shift: From Education to Indoctrination</h4>
<ul>
<li>World War II temporarily drove eugenics underground, but its core principles continued to influence education policy.
<ul>
<li>The focus shifted towards using schools as tools for social control and economic manipulation, aligning with the needs of a burgeoning industrial capitalist system.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Two congressional investigations (1915 and 1959) revealed that school policy was being shaped by corporate interests operating outside of public scrutiny.
<ul>
<li><strong>Findings:</strong> Both investigations concluded that major foundations like Carnegie and Rockefeller exerted significant influence over education policy through funding, research, and advocacy.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> These investigations were largely ignored, and their findings suppressed, highlighting the lack of transparency and accountability within the education system.</li>

<ul>
<li>Teacher training underwent a radical transformation, driven by private foundations, universities, and government agencies, with the goal of aligning education with the needs of the emerging global economy.</li>
<li><strong>Three key milestones:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>1. Designing Education for the Future:</strong> A government initiative that redefined education as a means to achieve national economic and social goals.

</ul></li>
<li><strong>2. The Behavioral Science Teacher Education Project (BSTEP):</strong> A large-scale project (Contract No.&nbsp;OEC-09-320424-4042) outlining plans to transform schools into laboratories for behavioral conditioning.
<ul>
<li><strong>Goals:</strong> To create a system where individuals are tracked from birth, exposed to subliminal influence, and conditioned to conform to predetermined beliefs and behaviors.</li>
<li><strong>Methods:</strong> Advocated for the use of chemical experimentation on minors, foreshadowing the rise of drugs like Ritalin and Adderall in classrooms.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>3. Bloom’s Taxonomy of Educational Objectives:</strong> A comprehensive manual by <strong>Benjamin Bloom</strong> (University of Chicago) that aimed to classify and control all aspects of human learning.
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide educators with a framework for shaping students’ thoughts, feelings, and actions through carefully designed instruction.</li>

<ul>
<li>Rising school violence in the 1960s, partly attributed to policies restricting disciplinary action, provided a pretext for further intervention.
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Ford Foundation’s</strong> policy mandating “<strong>due process</strong>” in schools hampered teachers’ ability to maintain order and address disruptive behavior effectively.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>BSTEP advocated for training teachers as “<strong>teacher therapists</strong>,” tasked with applying behavioral psychology techniques to manage students’ emotions and modify their behavior.</li>
<li>This shift marked a significant departure from traditional teaching roles, transforming educators into agents of social control.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="we-dont-need-brains">“We Don’t Need Brains”</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Historical Context:</strong> Between 1896 and 1920, industrialists and financiers like <strong>Andrew Carnegie</strong> and <strong>John D. Rockefeller</strong>, through their foundations, heavily influenced the development of compulsory schooling in the US.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>To create a workforce that was obedient, compliant, and trained for specific tasks rather than independent thinking and innovation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Evidence:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>The General Education Board</strong> (funded by Rockefeller), in its 1906 <strong>Occasional Letter No.&nbsp;1</strong>, stated its aim:
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“In our dreams, people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hands…We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning…The task…is very simple. We will organize children and teach them to do in a perfect way the things their fathers and mothers are doing in an imperfect way.”</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-literacy-decline-a-case-study-in-failure">The Literacy Decline: A Case Study in Failure</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>World War II Literacy Data:</strong> A high literacy rate (96%) was observed among men drafted during World War II (schooled in the 1930s), with only 4% deemed illiterate. (Source: Army enlistment tests)</li>
<li><strong>Korean War Literacy Decline:</strong> A significant drop in literacy (down to 81%) was observed among men drafted during the Korean War (schooled in the 1940s).</li>
<li><strong>Vietnam War Literacy Crisis:</strong> Illiteracy rates continued to rise, reaching 27% among men drafted during the Vietnam War (schooled in the 1950s and 1960s).</li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Despite increased years of schooling, more qualified teachers, and “improved” educational materials, literacy rates steadily declined.</li>
<li>This suggests that changes in teaching methods, particularly the shift from <strong>phonetic</strong> to <strong>non-phonetic</strong> reading instruction, played a significant role in the decline.</li>
<li>The lack of a phonetic foundation disproportionately impacted Black Americans, who historically had limited access to formal education and relied on schools to teach basic literacy skills.</li>
<li>The <strong>Adult Literacy Survey</strong> and the <strong>National Assessment of Educational Progress</strong> later reported a 40% illiteracy rate among Black Americans and 17% among White Americans.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="william-torrey-harris-the-architect-of-american-indoctrination">William Torrey Harris: The Architect of American Indoctrination</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background:</strong> <strong>William Torrey Harris</strong>, U.S. Commissioner of Education (1889-1906), was a leading proponent of Hegelian philosophy and a close friend of Andrew Carnegie.</li>
<li><strong>Influence:</strong> Harris played a pivotal role in shaping the American education system, promoting standardization and German-style compulsory schooling.</li>
<li><strong>Philosophy:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Harris believed that children were property of the state and that education’s purpose was to create citizens who were obedient, subservient to authority, and alienated from their individuality.</strong></li>
<li>He advocated for schools that were designed to “<strong>transcend the beauty of nature</strong>” and promote withdrawal from the external world.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Key Quotes:</strong>
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“<strong>Ninety-nine students out of a hundred are automata, careful to walk in prescribed paths, careful to follow the prescribed custom. This is not an accident but the result of substantial education which, scientifically defined, is the subsumption of the individual.</strong>” (Source: <em>The Philosophy of Education</em>, 1906)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“<strong>The great purpose of school [is] self-alienation…It is to master the physical self, to transcend the beauty of nature. School should develop the power to withdraw from the external world.</strong>” (Source: <em>The Philosophy of Education</em>, 1906)</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Harris’s ideas laid the groundwork for an education system designed to create a compliant workforce rather than critical thinkers. His influence can still be felt in the emphasis on standardized testing, conformity, and the suppression of creativity within many schools today.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-fourth-purpose-creating-human-resources">The Fourth Purpose: Creating Human Resources</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Original Purpose of Schooling:</strong> The traditional goals of education—moral development, civic responsibility, and personal growth—were gradually supplanted by a new objective: to produce human resources for the industrial economy.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate Influence:</strong> As schools became increasingly intertwined with the needs of business and industry, the curriculum shifted towards vocational training, obedience to authority, and the acceptance of a hierarchical social order.</li>
<li><strong>Woodrow Wilson’s Vision (1909):</strong> In a speech to businessmen, Wilson stated,
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“<strong>We want one class to have a liberal education. We want another class, a very much larger class of necessity, to forego the privilege of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific, difficult manual tasks.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Centralized Control:</strong> The rise of the “<strong>Education Trust</strong>” in 1917, comprised of representatives from powerful foundations, elite universities, and the National Education Association, further consolidated control over education policy in the hands of a select few.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences:</strong> This shift in purpose transformed schools from institutions of learning into factories for producing compliant workers, undermining the ideals of a free and democratic society.</li>

<section id="the-problem-of-overproduction" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem-of-overproduction">The Problem of Overproduction</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> <strong>Overproduction</strong>, also known as <strong>overcapacity</strong>, occurs when businesses produce more goods and services than the market can consume, leading to falling prices, economic instability, and social unrest.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Context:</strong> In the 19th century, America’s independent and resourceful population, coupled with its high levels of innovation, frequently led to overproduction and economic downturns.</li>
<li><strong>The Role of Education:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Policymakers and business leaders began to view education as a tool to manage overproduction by shaping consumer demand and limiting independent economic activity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> By conditioning citizens from a young age to become reliable employees rather than self-sufficient producers, the threat of overproduction could be mitigated.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences:</strong> This approach transformed education from a means of fostering independence and innovation into a tool for controlling the workforce and maintaining economic stability for the benefit of those in power.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The American Experiment:</strong> For the first two centuries of its existence, the United States thrived on a system of open-source learning, where individuals were free to pursue knowledge and skills through apprenticeship, self-study, and community engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Figures like Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and David Farragut exemplified the success of this approach, demonstrating that traditional education was not a prerequisite for achieving greatness.</li>
<li><strong>The Value of Self-Reliance:</strong> This system fostered independence, ingenuity, and a spirit of innovation, propelling America to the forefront of global progress.</li>
<li><strong>The Need for a Paradigm Shift:</strong> Gatto argues for a return to the principles of open-source learning, recognizing that the current system of compulsory schooling stifles creativity, limits human potential, and perpetuates social inequalities.</li>

<li><strong>The Urgency of Reform:</strong> The consequences of this system—declining literacy rates, rising social inequality, and a culture of conformity—demand urgent attention and a radical rethinking of education’s purpose.</li>
<li><strong>A Call to Action:</strong> The book serves as a wake-up call to reclaim the transformative power of education, urging readers to question assumptions, challenge the status quo, and create alternative systems that empower individuals and foster a more just and equitable society.</li>

<li>He worked for each relative, gaining practical experience and business acumen.</li>
<li>His goal was to become self-employed, like his relatives.</li>

<li>Government-mandated schooling undermined their community’s social fabric and family life.</li>
<li>The separation of knowledge from practical experience and the competitive nature of schooling were detrimental to their way of life.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Small, localized schools within walking distance of students’ homes.</li>
<li>Continuity in teachers to foster strong relationships and understanding.</li>
<li>A shorter school year focused on essential knowledge and skills.</li>
<li>Parental control over educational decisions.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-failure-to-teach-essential-skills">The Failure to Teach Essential Skills</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gatto argues that School District 3 fails to teach students the essential skills needed to thrive in the evolving global economy.
<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence:</strong> A brochure from Harvard University outlining nine essential skills for success in the new international economy is cited as a benchmark.
<ul>
<li><h4 id="nine-essential-skills" class="anchored">Nine Essential Skills:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ability to ask hard questions of data from various sources.</li>
<li>Ability to define problems independently.</li>
<li>Ability to extract useful information from irrelevant data.</li>
<li>Ability to conceptualize.</li>
<li>Ability to reorganize information for new perspectives.</li>
<li>Possessing a mind fluent in different modes of thought (deductive, inductive, heuristic, intuitive).</li>

<li>Skill in discussing issues, problems, or techniques.</li>
<li>Skill in rhetoric and persuasion.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto presents David Sarnoff’s life as a counterpoint to the failures of the education system.
<ul>
<li><strong>David Sarnoff’s Accomplishments:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Learned English and became a successful newsboy within five months of arriving in New York City at age nine, after his father died.</li>
<li>Owned his own newsstand at fourteen, using newspapers as his primary learning source.</li>
<li>Became an office boy at Marconi Wireless at fourteen through sheer initiative.</li>
<li>Taught himself telegraphy, leading to a successful career in the burgeoning field of radio technology.</li>
<li>Became president of RCA at age 39.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Sarnoff’s success was a result of self-directed learning, initiative, and real-world experience, not formal education.</li>
<li>Gatto implies that the current school system stifles these qualities in students.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto recounts a visit to a well-regarded alternative school in East Harlem, led by the respected educator Debbie Meyer.</li>
<li>Despite the school’s positive reputation, Gatto observes significant shortcomings stemming from bureaucratic constraints and traditional attitudes.
<ul>
<li><strong>Constraints and Shortcomings:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A pervasive culture of negativity and limitations (“you can’t do this, you can’t do that”).</li>
<li>Excessive emphasis on standardized tests.</li>
<li>Suppression of imagination and creativity among both students and teachers.</li>
<li>A trivialized community service program (two hours per week), rendering it meaningless.</li>

<ul>
<li>Last place out of 736 school districts in third-grade math and reading.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto argues that a culture of complacency, self-preservation, and corruption within the district perpetuates its failures.
<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence:</strong>
<ul>
<li>High teacher turnover rate (22% annually) is attributed to a “caste system” that rewards favored teachers with desirable assignments while burdening others with impossible workloads.</li>
<li>Inflated administrative bureaucracy and a “shadow economy” divert resources away from teaching and contribute to a deceptive student-teacher ratio.</li>
<li>Administrators prioritize their careers and maintaining the status quo over meaningful educational reform.</li>
<li>A principal’s statement that students’ futures are predetermined, highlighting a defeatist attitude toward disadvantaged students.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li>Gatto identifies two specific district policies that have had a detrimental impact on students’ ability to learn and thrive.
<ul>
<li><strong>Policy 1: Tolerance of Disruptive Behavior:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The decision, influenced by the Ford Foundation, to not control disruptive classroom behavior out of concern for students’ self-esteem is criticized as misguided and harmful.</li>
<li>Gatto contends that this policy has created a chaotic learning environment that hinders all students, including those who are well-behaved.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Policy 2: Recruitment of Disruptive Students:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The district’s practice of recruiting disruptive students from other areas to mask declining enrollment is condemned as a cynical maneuver that exacerbates the existing problems.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> These policies, combined with a lack of accountability for administrators, have resulted in a decline in educational standards and a system that fails to serve its students.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence:</strong>
<ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i-quit-i-think-a-scathing-critique-of-schooling">I Quit, I Think: A Scathing Critique of Schooling</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto’s essay, “I Quit, I Think,” published in the Wall Street Journal, outlines their reasons for leaving the profession:
<ul>
<li><strong>Government schooling is the most radical adventure in history</strong>, killing the family by:
<ul>
<li>Monopolizing childhood’s best times.</li>
<li>Teaching disrespect for home and parents.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The structure of schooling is rooted in an <strong>Egyptian, not Greek or Roman, blueprint</strong>, based on the belief that:
<ul>
<li><strong>Human value is scarce</strong>, symbolized by a pyramid’s narrow peak.</li>
<li>This idea, passed down through the Puritans, found scientific expression in the <strong>bell curve</strong>, which suggests talent is biologically determined.</li>
<li><strong>School serves as the church of this religious notion, with rituals to maintain orthodoxy.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Professional educators benefit from making the simple seem complex</strong>, subordinating the public to their expertise.</li>
<li><strong>School, as a jobs program, contract provider, and guardian of the social order, resists reform.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reform efforts fail to fundamentally change the system.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Standardized measures like age grading and testing are arbitrary and harmful</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Children develop at different paces, and judging them by uniform standards is illogical.</li>
<li>Gatto uses the example of David (reading at age 4) and Rachel (reading at age 9), who show no difference in reading ability at age 13.</li>
<li>School, however, would label Rachel as learning disabled and hold David back, creating artificial categories and dependencies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto argues that <strong>learning disabilities and giftedness are “sacred myths,”</strong> perpetuating the school system.</li>
<li><strong>True education is not standardized;</strong> there are countless ways to learn, like fingerprints.</li>
<li><strong>State-certified teachers are not essential for education and may hinder it.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Good schools need free-market choices and variety, not more money or time.</strong></li>
<li><strong>National curriculum and testing are based on ignorance of how people learn.</strong></li>
<li>Gatto concludes, unable to participate in a system that harms children, and seeks alternative work.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-religion-of-schooling-and-the-myth-of-dumbness">A Religion of Schooling and the Myth of Dumbness</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto reflects on their 30-year career, questioning how they participated in an <strong>indoctrinating and sorting machine</strong> that steals children’s potential.</li>
<li>School, they argue, is a <strong>religion</strong>; understanding its “holy mission” is crucial to understanding its workings.</li>
<li>While human failings exist within the system, they are not the root cause; <strong>schooling itself is designed to produce “dumbness.”</strong></li>
<li><strong>This new dumbness is not mere ignorance but a categorization of relative stupidity</strong>, creating artificial hierarchies like:
<ul>
<li>Gifted and talented</li>
<li>Mainstream</li>
<li>Special Ed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These categories ration learning, benefiting the system and social order.</li>
<li>The <strong>“new dumb” are perceived as dangerous and require conditioning with “commercially prepared disinformation.”</strong></li>
<li>This dumbness particularly harms middle and upper-middle-class children, already pressured to conform, leaving them vulnerable to existential crises later in life.</li>
<li>Gatto cites English historian Alan Bullock: <strong>“Evil is a state of incompetence.”</strong> Schooling, they argue, has filled the 20th century with evil by breaking children to a system that rewards compliance over critical thinking.</li>
<li>This system produces individuals dependent on group approval, exemplified by a National Merit Scholar in Gatto’s family who aspired to be “a small part in a great machine.”</li>
<li><strong>The “dumbed down” cannot think independently, constantly seeking external validation and vulnerable to manipulation.</strong></li>
<li>Gatto challenges prevalent explanations for “dumbness”:
<ul>
<li><strong>Biological determinism (the bell curve)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Capitalist oppression (neo-Marxism)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Moral failing (Calvinism)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Natural selection (Darwinism)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Social utility (pragmatic elitism)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Karmic retribution (Buddhism)</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>All these explanations, Gatto contends, justify the existence of a vast bureaucracy to manage the “problem” of the “dumb.”</li>
<li>Gatto’s proposition: <strong>mass dumbness is a fabrication, not a reality.</strong> It was invented to serve the system.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto introduces <strong>Hector Rodriguez, a 13-year-old student</strong>, observed one November day:
<ul>
<li>Small, olive-skinned, with large black eyes.</li>
<li>Trying to slip past the Central Park skating rink gate despite having a paid ticket.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hector’s actions, puzzling at first, demonstrate his experimental nature—testing the gate’s security with a safety net (the ticket).</li>
<li>School records reveal Hector’s history:
<ul>
<li>Labeled an “outlaw” for minor infractions that would not have been criminalized in the past.</li>
<li>Attending one of New York State’s lowest-rated schools, facing potential state takeover.</li>
<li>Placed in the “Mainstream D” category, the lowest of the low, above only Special Ed.</li>
<li>Standardized test scores placed him three years behind his peers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite this, Hector displays initiative and a desire to challenge norms, as seen in his gate-crashing experiment.</li>
<li>His “criminal” record includes:
<ul>
<li>Being caught with a fake gun in his former elementary school during Christmas break.</li>
<li>Intending to “free the slaves” (the younger children) like a modern-day Spartacus.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This incident highlights the school’s perception of Hector as a problem, as expressed by the principal: “Gatto, what have you done to me?”</li>
<li>A year later, Hector’s high school record shows:
<ul>
<li>Failing every subject.</li>
<li>Excessive absences and truancy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The system paints a picture of Hector as a lost cause:
<ul>
<li>Poor, small, minority, ignored, “dumb,” a trouble-maker, a failure.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto asks: <strong>What is society to do with its Hectors?</strong></li>
<li>Hector represents millions of children deemed problematic by the education system.</li>
<li>Gatto argues that <strong>schooling was reimagined to control children like Hector</strong>, turning it into:
<ul>
<li>A warehouse</li>
<li>A behavior modification clinic</li>
<li>A tool for attitude adjustment</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This system is justified as a defense against chaos, with Hector representing the chaos that needs taming.</li>
<li>The principal, in the documentary about Gatto’s class, acknowledges the system’s flaws but defends it as better than chaos.</li>
<li>Gatto challenges this notion: <strong>Is chaos the only alternative to a stifling system?</strong></li>
<li><strong>The real demon, Gatto argues, is the misperception that Hector is the problem.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Forced schooling, presented as a bulwark against chaos, is actually the source of the problem.</strong></li>
<li>The belief that <strong>human nature’s irrationality must be suppressed</strong> is presented as a dangerous dogma driving the education system.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto sought a solution to counteract the negative effects of excessive media consumption, recognizing that traditional preaching was ineffective.</li>
<li>Gatto believed that relief could be found by encouraging physical activity and real-life experiences, as opposed to passively consuming media.</li>
<li>The core issue identified was the suppression of <strong>natural feedback circuits</strong>, which are essential for learning from mistakes.</li>
<li>Gatto uses the example of learning to sail:
<ul>
<li>A novice sailor will inevitably make mistakes, such as tacking too far left or right.</li>
<li>However, through practice and feedback, the sailor learns to adjust and improve.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Similarly, mastering speech requires significant practice and feedback.</li>
<li>Gatto argues that bureaucracies, including school systems, often fail because they cannot efficiently respond to feedback.
<ul>
<li>They are bound by rigid rules and resistant to input from parents, teachers, students, or outside sources.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto observed that the rigid structure of traditional schooling limited students’ opportunities for growth through feedback.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto’s solution was a <strong>guerrilla curriculum</strong> designed to restore natural feedback circuits in children.</li>
<li>This curriculum targeted inactivity and activities that did not significantly engage feedback mechanisms.</li>
<li>Gatto believed that sufficient activity, regardless of its specific nature, would motivate children to reduce their screen time.</li>
<li>The goal was to shift children from being passive spectators to active participants in their own lives.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration from the Camino de Santiago:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Camino de Santiago is a medieval pilgrimage route across northern Spain, ending at the burial place of the Apostle James in Santiago de Compostela.</li>
<li>Thousands of people undertake this pilgrimage annually, seeking personal growth, self-reliance, connection with nature, and time for reflection.</li>

<li>These expeditions involved:
<ul>
<li>Walking the circumference of Manhattan (approximately 30 miles)</li>
<li>Exploring different neighborhoods, observing and analyzing their characteristics</li>
<li>Mapping Central Park, university campuses, business districts, churches, and museums</li>

<li>Gatto was surprised by how easily this transformation was achieved, requiring neither exceptional talent nor financial resources.</li>
<li>While implementing the curriculum with 130 students annually was challenging, Gatto believes it would be significantly easier in a system that prioritized learning over social control.</li>

<li><strong>Potential trade-offs:</strong> Schooling weakens family and social relationships, but there may be unseen benefits to this disconnection.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on winning over learning:</strong> School prioritizes winning, leading to scandals when students’ lack of knowledge is exposed.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural implications:</strong> Sending children to strangers for instruction reflects a significant statement about modern culture that deserves reflection.</li>
<li><strong>Examples of negative portrayals of school:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Horace’s ode on the torments of schooling.</li>

<li>He did not link education to national prosperity, only free trade, competition, and division of labor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Education as compensation:</strong> Smith believed education was necessary to counter the negative psychological effects of capitalism.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalism’s psychological damage:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Makes workers cowardly.</li>
<li>Makes workers stupid.</li>
<li>Makes workers sluggish.</li>
<li>Makes workers indifferent to everything except basic needs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Educational schooling:</strong> Smith advocated for education that heals the damage caused by capitalism to community and individuality.</li>
<li><strong>Potential of all children:</strong> Smith believed all children possess the same inherent talents, regardless of social class.
<ul>
<li>Differences are created by <strong>deliberate deprivation</strong> of intellectual stimulation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consequences of deprivation:</strong> Deformed minds, inability to think critically, and loss of judgment.</li>
<li><strong>Relevance to modern schooling:</strong> Smith’s description resonates with the state of public education today.</li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s counterattack:</strong> Gatto’s personalized curriculum aimed to address cowardice, stupidity, sluggishness, and indifference.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on partnerships:</strong> Working with motivated students to achieve their individual goals.</li>
<li><strong>Schooling the unmotivated:</strong> Those who were not interested in education were subjected to traditional schooling methods.</li>
<li><strong>Smith’s insight:</strong> The differences between “bright” and “stupid” students are largely manufactured through deliberate deprivation.</li>

<li><strong>Student awareness of irrelevance:</strong> Young people understand that school often prioritizes the interests of others over their own needs and curiosities.</li>
<li><strong>Questioning the purpose:</strong> Students question the value of tests and assignments that seem disconnected from their lives.</li>
<li><strong>Political censorship:</strong> School curricula are shaped by political agendas, omitting or downplaying information that might challenge the status quo.</li>
<li><strong>The gulf between rhetoric and reality:</strong> The disconnect between idealistic educational goals and the practical limitations of schooling breeds cynicism.</li>
<li><strong>The Australian example:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental degradation:</strong> Australia’s ecosystem is threatened by unsustainable practices like sheep farming.</li>
<li><strong>Political influence:</strong> The powerful sheep lobby prevents schools from addressing these environmental issues.</li>
<li><strong>Relevance to curriculum:</strong> If critical environmental issues are deemed unsuitable for study, then seemingly irrelevant topics like the Leaning Tower of Pisa are equally questionable.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The importance of uninterrupted time:</strong> Focused attention and deep thinking require uninterrupted time for reflection and synthesis.</li>
<li><strong>The illusion of attention:</strong> In a fragmented environment, people learn to feign attention rather than genuinely engage with ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Memorization vs.&nbsp;understanding:</strong> Broken time allows for memorization but hinders the development of true understanding.</li>
<li><strong>The need for uninterrupted sleep and waking time:</strong> Both are crucial for cognitive function.</li>
<li><strong>School’s fragmented environment:</strong> Schools are characterized by constant interruptions and distractions.</li>
<li><strong>Psychological impact of broken time:</strong> The constant disruption of thought processes leads to mental fatigue and a diminished capacity for learning.</li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s experience:</strong> Gatto found it difficult to maintain focus and deliver effective lessons in the face of constant interruptions.</li>
<li><strong>The importance of personal time:</strong> Uninterrupted time is essential for developing theories, testing hypotheses, and making connections between ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Coleridge’s Kublai Khan example:</strong> A single interruption derailed Coleridge’s creative process.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>James Salter</strong>, a travel writer, admired Europe and its unique ability to answer Kant’s questions.</li>
<li>Salter believed Europe provided <strong>education</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Not traditional school lessons</strong>, but a deeper understanding of life.</li>
<li><strong>A guide on:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>How to endure.</strong></li>
<li><strong>How to appreciate:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Leisure</li>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Love</li>
<li>Conversation</li>
<li>Nakedness</li>
<li>Architecture</li>
<li>Streets</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>A new way of thinking, fresh and insightful.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Europe’s Impact:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>History’s Shadow:</strong> Being surrounded by Europe’s rich history makes one aware of their small place in time.</li>
<li><strong>Knowing nothing is equivalent to having done nothing.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-obsession is like “worshipping a dust moat.”</strong></li>
<li><strong>Europe is an “immense and unfathomable classroom,” beyond any catalog or description.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Salter’s Comparison</strong>: Salter contrasts the vastness of European education with the limitations of traditional schooling.</li>
<li><strong>Challenge to the Reader:</strong> Look at America as Salter did Europe. Did your schooling teach you how we arrived at our current state?</li>

<li><strong>Occasion:</strong> Testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Human Relations</li>
<li><strong>Topic:</strong> The future of schools in the year 2000</li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Pessimistic View:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schools in 2000 will likely mirror those of 1990 and 1890.</strong></li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-historical-perspective-1790-vs.-today">A Historical Perspective: 1790 vs.&nbsp;Today</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>1790:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Education was readily attainable in America.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Schooling was:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Voluntary</li>
<li>Short in duration</li>
<li>Did not monopolize a child’s time</li>
<li>Did not burden families</li>
<li>Did not instill servile habits in the young</li>
<li>Did not indoctrinate with pre-determined thoughts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fewer people claiming to provide education resulted in greater freedom to learn.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Example: In Massachusetts, literacy rates were higher when schooling was voluntary.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Today:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The possibility of obtaining a quality education is threatened by compulsory schooling.</li>
<li>Political roadblocks hinder change:
<ul>
<li>The current system financially benefits those in power.</li>
<li>Schools provide lucrative contracts and jobs, creating conflicts of interest for politicians.</li>
<li>Politicians are beholden to donors with vested interests in maintaining the status quo.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Assertion:</strong> Genuine change must come from individuals (parents, students, and teachers) who challenge the system.</li>
<li>Homeschooling is a prime example of this rebellion.</li>
<li>The system has had a century to prove itself and has failed.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1: Define an Educated Person:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A nationwide debate is needed to establish a clear definition of what constitutes an educated person.</li>
<li>Professional pedagogy has failed to provide a concrete definition beyond vague generalizations.</li>
<li>A shared understanding of educational goals is crucial for meaningful reform.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exposing the Fallacy of Standardized Testing:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current educational emphasis on standardized test scores is misguided.</strong></li>
<li><strong>High test scores do not necessarily translate to real-world competence or success.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong>** Many successful individuals (including U.S. presidents and corporate executives) have achieved success despite mediocre test scores.</li>
<li><strong>Inconsistency:</strong> While consumers demand performance data in other areas (e.g., horse racing), they are denied this information when it comes to educators.</li>
<li><strong>Distinction:</strong> High standards are not synonymous with standardized testing.</li>
<li><strong>Newspeak Manipulation:</strong> The public has been conditioned to equate the two.</li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Proposal:</strong> Schools should guarantee the development of valuable human competencies or lose their power to enforce attendance.</li>

<li>Gatto’s granddaughter, Christina, is a rebellious and accomplished individual.
<ul>
<li>Rode her bike on Fifth Avenue in defiance of a city ban.</li>
<li>Captain of a national champion debating team.</li>
<li>Legally changed her name from Gudrun to Christina.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto comes from a long line of “boat rockers” and contrarians.
<ul>
<li>His wife Janet’s family was outlawed by the British Crown.</li>
<li>His great-great-grandmother from Glenorchy wore a top hat, a symbol of unconventionality.</li>
<li>The outlaw Rob Roy considered Gatto’s wife’s clan to be his own.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto and his wife Janet were married in a Buddhist temple near Columbia University in New York City.
<ul>
<li>They chose this location because they were both unemployed, broke, and underage for a civil marriage.</li>
<li>The Buddhist temple offered free marriage ceremonies, unlike other religious institutions they approached.</li>
<li>Janet was pregnant with Gatto’s daughter (Christina’s mother) at the time of their marriage.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto recounts the struggles and triumphs of his ancestors:
<ul>
<li><strong>His grandmother:</strong> Fired from a job for attempting to organize a union.</li>
<li><strong>Gatto:</strong> Fired from a job on Madison Avenue for incompetence.</li>
<li><strong>His great-great-grandfather Giovanni (Italian side):</strong>
<ul>
<li>A Presbyterian, journalist, and Freemason, he faced persecution in early 20th century Italy.</li>
<li>Forced to flee Italy with his wife, Lucrezia, who lost her inheritance and title for marrying him.</li>
<li>Found success in Pittsburgh working for Mellon Bank but died young from an extravagant lifestyle.</li>
<li>Buried in an unmarked grave by Lucrezia for having a mistress.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>His great-grandfather Harry Taylor Zimmer (German side):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Town printer and traveling circus owner in Monongahela, Pennsylvania.</li>
<li>A staunch Republican in a predominantly Democratic town.</li>
<li>Ran for mayor multiple times, using his printing press to launch scathing attacks on opponents.</li>
<li>Openly supported German victory during World War II, making Gatto’s childhood walks to school eventful.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto highlights the protective presence of his uncle, Bud Zimmer:
<ul>
<li>The toughest man in town, Bud’s reputation shielded Gatto from bullies.</li>

<ul>
<li>He believes that such institutions promote an illusion of social privilege and limit personal growth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He criticizes the modern education system:
<ul>
<li><strong>Promotes a hierarchical view of education:</strong> Elite colleges are falsely touted as the sole gateways to success.</li>
<li><strong>Instills a false sense of urgency:</strong> Students feel pressured to gain acceptance into prestigious colleges, leading to unhealthy competition and anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>Perpetuates social inequality:</strong> Gatto uses George Orwell’s <em>Animal Farm</em> analogy to criticize the elitist mindset prevalent in prestigious institutions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He challenges the notion that college guarantees success:
<ul>
<li>Financial success can be achieved through alternative paths.</li>
<li>True fulfillment comes from finding purpose and adding value to society.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He argues that true education is a personal journey of self-discovery:
<ul>
<li>It’s about developing critical thinking skills and navigating the complexities of the world.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He outlines eight essential elements of true learning:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Self-knowledge:</strong> Understanding one’s character, strengths, weaknesses, and tendencies.</li>
<li><strong>Observation:</strong> Cultivating sharp observational skills to gather accurate information.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Learning to receive and evaluate criticism effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Developing the ability to break down complex problems into manageable components.</li>
<li><strong>Mirroring:</strong> Cultivating empathy and the ability to understand diverse perspectives.</li>
<li><strong>Expression:</strong> Mastering clear and effective communication in both written and spoken forms.</li>
<li><strong>Judgment:</strong> Developing the ability to discern truth from falsehood and make sound decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Adding Value:</strong> Contributing meaningfully to society and every interaction.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto argues that the current education system, particularly in elite institutions like Dartmouth, is modeled after Francis Bacon’s <em>The New Atlantis</em>.</li>
<li>He outlines the core principles of Bacon’s vision:
<ul>
<li><strong>Utility over Reflection:</strong> Education should primarily focus on training a workforce for the needs of corporations and government institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Social Control:</strong> Universities should function as instruments to maintain social order and stability.</li>
<li><strong>Surveillance and Control:</strong> Implement systems to monitor and regulate the behavior and aspirations of the masses.</li>
<li><strong>Managed Morality:</strong> Promote a culture of permissiveness in personal morals while emphasizing conformity in professional life.</li>
<li><strong>Co-option of Potential Leaders:</strong> Identify and absorb talented individuals from lower classes into the ruling structure to prevent dissent.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto argues that this system has led to several negative consequences:
<ul>
<li><strong>Social Unrest:</strong> A growing sense of disillusionment and distrust in leadership due to increasing inequality and lack of opportunity.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Inequality:</strong> The widening gap between the rich and the poor, fueled by corporate greed and the exploitation of workers.</li>
<li><strong>Contingent Labor:</strong> The rise of temporary and insecure employment, creating a precarious workforce without benefits or long-term security.</li>
<li><strong>Lean Production:</strong> The relentless pursuit of efficiency and profit maximization at the expense of worker well-being and job satisfaction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto concludes by emphasizing that addressing these issues requires political action and a fundamental shift in societal values rather than relying solely on traditional education systems.
<ul>
<li>He urges his granddaughter to be an agent of change and fight for a more just and equitable society.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Schooling’s Expansion:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Originating as a limited endeavor in colonial America (2 hours/day, a few months/year), schooling has steadily expanded its reach.</li>
<li>It now encroaches upon personal time and resists boundaries like summer vacation.</li>
<li>The concept of “<strong>lifelong learning</strong>” often translates to “lifelong schooling,” promoting the idea that more schooling is always the solution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Schooling as a False Solution:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto argues that societal issues (incoherence, aimlessness, incompetence, class hatred) often attributed to a lack of schooling are, in fact, exacerbated by it.</li>
<li>More schooling, he contends, cannot fix problems created by the institution itself.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Schooling’s Assault on Alternative Forms of Development:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Schooling undermines and seeks to supplant other vital sources of growth and learning:
<ul>
<li><strong>Family:</strong> Dismissed as a “retrograde institution” to be replaced by idealized, expert-designed models.</li>
<li><strong>Church:</strong> Seen as a threat to Gattoity of expert opinion and therefore targeted for removal.</li>
<li><strong>Tradition, Ethnic Loyalty, Loyalty to Place:</strong> Deemed obstacles to progress and slated for eradication.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This systematic dismantling of alternative influences, Gatto argues, cripples individual sovereignty, erodes ideals of liberty, and disrupts the natural transmission of knowledge and values across generations.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="schooling-vs.-education-key-distinctions">Schooling vs.&nbsp;Education: Key Distinctions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto presents several key distinctions between schooling and education:
<ul>
<li><strong>Source of Organization:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schooling:</strong> Controlled externally through command and control structures.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Self-directed and driven by internal motivation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Connection to Learning Sources:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schooling:</strong> Isolates students from diverse learning opportunities to maintain administrative efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Actively seeks out a rich network of connections – random, intentional, varied, and often unexpected – recognizing that resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and innovation thrive on diverse inputs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Role of Feedback:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schooling:</strong> Relies on external rules and evaluations, limiting opportunities for independent judgment and self-correction.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Emphasizes the crucial role of natural feedback loops. Students learn to attend to these loops, not to conform to external dictates, fostering self-reliance and personalized learning pathways.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Focus of Learning:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schooling:</strong> Prioritizes subject knowledge and specialization, aiming to produce efficient clerks for predefined roles within existing systems.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Values broad contexts and connections between disciplines, recognizing that true understanding and innovation often emerge from cross-fertilization of ideas.
<ul>
<li>Example: John Cancius, a non-specialist and college dropout, developed a breakthrough cancer treatment precisely because he wasn’t confined by specialized knowledge.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Approach to Knowledge:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schooling:</strong> Emphasizes memorization and acceptance of established truths, discouraging critical thinking.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Cultivates a state of internal debate and questioning, constantly seeking to challenge and refine existing knowledge.
<ul>
<li>This echoes Schumpeter’s concept of “<strong>creative destruction</strong>” – the driving force of capitalism – where questioning established norms and seeking better alternatives fuels progress.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact on Well-being:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto cites the <strong>International Happiness Survey</strong>, which consistently identifies three key factors for a happy life:
<ul>
<li>Good relationships.</li>
<li>Good health.</li>
<li>Satisfying work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Schooling, however, often undermines these factors:</strong>
<ul>
<li>It promotes unhealthy lifestyles and offers little support for developing strong relationships.</li>
<li>Tracking systems and segregation by background exacerbate class prejudice, hindering relationships across difference.</li>
<li>The work imposed rarely connects with the genuine interests and passions of young people.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gatto acknowledges the potential for criticism: Are his views exaggerated? Is schooling not an essential institution with flaws that can be rationally addressed?</li>
<li>He counters by suggesting the presence of a “<strong>dark force</strong>” – a deliberate, hidden agenda operating within the institution of schooling.</li>
<li>He argues that without exposing and confronting this hidden force, any talk of “school reform” is futile.</li>
<li>To support his claim, he presents three “hair-raising school stories” designed to illustrate the seemingly irrational and even sinister nature of schooling’s influence:

<li>The incidents described are meant to raise questions about the true motives and mechanisms of power at play within the education system.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="incident-at-nuremberg-homeschooling-as-a-threat">Incident at Nuremberg: Homeschooling as a Threat</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> January 29, 2008</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Nuremberg, Germany</li>
<li><strong>Victim:</strong> Melissa Busekros, a 16-year-old girl</li>
<li><strong>Event:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Melissa is forcibly removed from her home by 15 police officers and city officials.</li>
<li>Her “crime” is homeschooling, a practice outlawed in Germany since 1937 under the Nazi regime.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Author’s Response:</strong>
<ul>
<li>He expresses his disgust by writing to the German ambassador in Washington, highlighting the disturbing parallels between contemporary Germany and its Nazi past.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Details of the Incident:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Despite no history of behavioral issues, Melissa is subjected to a 240-minute psychiatric interrogation focused solely on her reasons for homeschooling.</li>
<li>The interrogation concludes that Melissa suffers from “school phobia,” a dubious diagnosis used to justify the forceful intervention.</li>
<li>German authorities cite Melissa’s “delayed development” by one year as evidence of harm, despite lacking any internationally recognized standard for such assessment.</li>
<li>The court order authorizes the forceful removal of Melissa, deeming it necessary to protect her from her parents’ “illegal conduct” of homeschooling.</li>
<li>The German Education Authority vows to “bring convictions of the family into line,” employing language reminiscent of totalitarian regimes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Author’s Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>He questions the reasoning, philosophy, and values driving such extreme measures against a peaceful family exercising their right to choose an alternative educational path.</li>
<li>He draws parallels between this incident and Germany’s dark history of persecution, from witch hunts to the Holocaust, suggesting a dangerous pattern of suppressing individual liberty and enforcing conformity through state power.</li>
<li>He criticizes the German education system’s rigid adherence to rules and its stifling of individual initiative, citing the ThyssenKrupp steel plant debacle as evidence of its negative economic consequences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto’s letter to the German ambassador receives no reply.</li>
<li>The incident highlights the extreme measures employed to enforce compulsory schooling and the silencing of dissenting voices.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="incident-at-highland-high-suppressing-inconvenient-truths">Incident at Highland High: Suppressing Inconvenient Truths</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> March 25, 2004</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Highland High School, Rockland County, New York</li>
<li><strong>Event:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto is invited to speak at Highland High by school board member John Jankowicz, who is concerned about the negative effects of the school’s rigid, test-driven approach to education.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Observations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>He notes the affluence of the school and the students’ sense of entitlement, masking a deeper lack of intellectual curiosity and critical thinking skills.</li>
<li>He recognizes the pervasive climate of fear and dishonesty surrounding college admissions, used as a tool to control student behavior.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gatto’s Talk:</strong>
<ul>
<li>He decides to address the students’ anxieties by deconstructing the myths surrounding college admissions, using real-world examples to challenge their assumptions.</li>
<li>He presents evidence that many successful individuals, including industry leaders, writers, and even politicians, did not conform to the traditional model of academic success.</li>
<li>He cites examples of college dropouts who have achieved extraordinary things, challenging the notion that elite college acceptance is the only path to a meaningful life.</li>
<li>He encourages students to question Gattoity of school officials and to demand transparency regarding their own educators’ academic records.</li>
<li>He shares information about the admission policies of prestigious universities, emphasizing that factors beyond grades and test scores, such as initiative, creativity, and real-world experience, are highly valued.</li>
<li>He presents Richard Branson’s entrepreneurial success as an example of a high school dropout who defied expectations and achieved extraordinary things.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Police Intervention:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In the midst of Gatto’s calm and factual presentation, a police detail suddenly enters the auditorium and orders everyone to leave.</li>
<li>The officer in charge uses a bullhorn to assert control, creating a deliberately intimidating atmosphere.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Aftermath:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gatto learns that the superintendent, McCarthy, deemed the talk “inflammatory” and called the police to shut it down.</li>
<li>This extreme reaction, despite Gatto’s calm demeanor and factual content, suggests a deep-seated resistance to any challenge of the established schooling narrative.</li>
<li>Gatto’s scheduled evening talk for parents is also canceled, further demonstrating the school’s determination to suppress dissenting views.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Media Coverage and Silence:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The local newspaper, the Mid-Hudson Highland Post, publishes a sanitized account of the incident, omitting any mention of the police intervention.</li>
<li>The superintendent falsely claims that Gatto showed a “violent film,” further highlighting the school’s dishonest attempts to control the narrative.</li>
<li>Gatto’s subsequent attempts to gather perspectives from the superintendent, principal, parents’ association, and student newspaper are met with complete silence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The incident at Highland High demonstrates the power of fear and control within the school system.</li>
<li>It shows how easily authorities can silence dissenting voices and suppress information that challenges the status quo.</li>
<li>The lack of transparency and accountability further reinforces the idea of a hidden agenda at work.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="incident-at-walden-crushing-local-control-and-common-sense">Incident at Walden: Crushing Local Control and Common Sense</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> 1991</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Walden, Vermont, a rural town with four historic one-room schoolhouses</li>
<li><strong>Event:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The state of Vermont threatens to close Walden’s beloved one-room schools, citing the cost of making them wheelchair accessible as prohibitive.</li>
<li>This is despite the schools’ strong academic performance, the community’s satisfaction, and the children’s evident well-being.</li>
<li>A plan is put forward to build a centralized concrete block school and bus students from up to 50 miles away.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Author’s Involvement:</strong>
<ul>
<li>He is invited to Walden to advocate for the preservation of the one-room schools.</li>
<li>He reviews the state’s proposal and finds the estimated costs for renovations to be grossly inflated.</li>
<li>He seeks expert testimony from a renowned architect familiar with construction costs in Vermont.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Expert Opinion and Fear:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The architect confirms that the state’s estimates are ten times higher than the actual cost, suggesting a deliberate attempt to mislead the community.</li>
<li>He reveals that the contract for the new school has likely already been promised to a specific firm, further highlighting the corruption at play.</li>
<li>However, the architect refuses to testify publicly, fearing professional repercussions from the state government.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Despite Gatto’s best efforts and the community’s desire to preserve their schools, the state’s repeated threats and the climate of fear prove too powerful.</li>
<li>Walden reluctantly approves the bond issue, goes into debt, and builds the centralized school, sacrificing their unique educational environment and sense of community control.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Walden incident demonstrates how a powerful entity like the state government can exploit its authority and financial leverage to impose its will on a community.</li>
<li>It highlights the corrupt practices often used to justify decisions made behind closed doors, benefiting select interests at the expense of local needs and desires.</li>
<li>The architect’s fear of speaking out reveals the insidious reach of such systems and the potential for silencing dissent even within professional circles.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-the-urgent-need-for-subversion">Conclusion: The Urgent Need for Subversion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatto uses these three incidents to illustrate the pervasive and often hidden forces at play within the institution of schooling.</li>
<li>He argues that these forces prioritize control, conformity, and the maintenance of power over the genuine needs and well-being of students.</li>
<li>He concludes that true education requires a conscious effort to subvert the harmful aspects of schooling, to question its assumptions, and to seek out alternative paths to knowledge and personal fulfillment.</li>
<li>Gatto issues a call to action:
<ul>
<li>Recognize the dark side of schooling and its impact on individuals and society.</li>
<li>Actively resist its attempts to limit thinking, creativity, and individual potential.</li>
<li>Seek out alternative educational experiences that nurture curiosity, critical thinking, and a love of learning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatto believes that by understanding and challenging the hidden agendas of schooling, individuals can reclaim their right to a meaningful and empowering education. He leaves the reader with the responsibility to carry on this fight:
<ul>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“But you’ll have to convince yourself of the substance of my allegation, that some sort of dark matter, some powerful but invisible force is at work in schooling. If you are to become strong enough to defend yourself and your family, I can’t do the work for you. You can’t memorize my conclusions.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Because you choose not to see the dark world school represents, because you only pay attention to its stupidities, it gets worse all the time.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Do I mean to imply that Highland School is the worst school in America? Hardly. For all I know, it is one of the best. Certainly it’s one of the richest. What you need to ask yourself is how many school districts from coast to coast find truth unbearable because it gets in the way of their real mission.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Unless the ends of the operation are put on public trial, and its sexual relationship with economics and social management exposed to the light and ended, each reform effort will only be another illusion, another room added to the National House of Mirrors.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Our government thinks some companies are too big to be allowed to fail, and that schooling is too important to allow education to get in its way.”</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>Information generated is unreliable and misleading.</li>
<li>Data is unused in adult life.</li>
<li>No correlation between test performance and future success.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Damaging Effects:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Significant personal and social harm to students.</li>
<li>Ranking system creates winners and losers, fostering a sense of inferiority.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tool of Social Control:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Weaponized by social engineers to control institutional schooling.</li>
<li>Used to classify individuals as human resources.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Waste of Resources:</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> New York City Public Schools’ failure to provide mandated physical education.
<ul>
<li>Only 1 in 25 students receive the legal minimum of 24 minutes of physical education per day (New York Sun, May 8, 2008).</li>
<li>Parents concerned about lack of physical education, but have no significant voice in school decisions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consequences:</strong>
<ul>
<li>National epidemic of childhood obesity and diabetes.</li>
<li>Physical and psychological harm to students.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Institutional Hypocrisy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>NYC Board of Education claims to be “beginning to realize” the importance of student health after a century of control (New York Sun, May 8, 2008).</li>
<li>Schools continue to prioritize confinement over physical activity.</li>

<li>Standardization based on the German model.</li>
<li>Standardized testing implemented and gradually gained importance (fully implemented by 1963).</li>
