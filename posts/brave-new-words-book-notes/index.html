<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-khanmigo-works">How Khanmigo Works</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interactive Tutoring</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Students can ask for help through a chat interface.</li>
<li>Instead of providing direct answers, Khanmigo guides students through problems like a human tutor.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Student: “I’m having trouble with polynomials. Can you help explain how to find the degree of this polynomial and the leading coefficient in this question? <span class="math inline">\(3x^{2}-5x+2\)</span>.”</li>
<li>Khanmigo: “No problem. Let’s break it down. The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable, in this case x, in the polynomial. The leading coefficient is the number in front of the term with the highest degree. Looking at our polynomial, can you identify the term with the highest power of x and the number in front of it?”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Personalized Feedback</strong>: Provides specific feedback and encouragement.
<ul>
<li>Example: “Close, but not quite. Remember, we’re looking for the highest power of x in the polynomial. Let’s try again together.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cross-Curricular Applications</strong>: Works across various subjects, including history, chemistry, physics, and art.</li>
<li><strong>Beyond Subject Matter</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Motivates learners.</li>
<li>Quizzes them.</li>
<li>Summarizes videos.</li>
<li>Adapts to individual needs.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="khanmigos-conversational-abilities-and-memory" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="khanmigos-conversational-abilities-and-memory">Khanmigo’s Conversational Abilities and Memory</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural and Personable Language</strong>: Uses a conversational and encouraging tone.
<ul>
<li>Example: “Hey, you’re doing this pretty well. Don’t worry if you have trouble doing it at first. It is a little bit more advanced. Why don’t we try this new approach?”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Memory of Previous Interactions</strong>: Remembers past conversations and can reference them in later sessions.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Student (previously expressed interest in soccer): “Why should I care about this?” (referring to algebra equations)</li>
<li>Khanmigo: “Well, what do you care about?”</li>
<li>Student: “Not math. I’d much rather be talking about soccer.”</li>
<li>Khanmigo: “Okay. So let’s say you are a soccer coach and you want to model the number of goals your team scores based on the number of hours they practice each week. You come up with the following polynomial, <span class="math inline">\(3x^{2}-5x+2\)</span>. Can you identify the degree of this polynomial and the leading coefficient?”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Personalized Examples</strong>: Uses student interests to create relevant examples in different subjects.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>:
<ul>
<li>(Days later, during a history lesson on federalism)</li>
<li>Khanmigo: “Imagine a soccer league. Let’s think about the different ways to govern it. Does the team govern itself any way it wants to, by doing its own thing? Or does a central authority govern the team? Federalism is a system of government where power is divided between a central authority and smaller political units, like states or provinces.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Adapting to User Preferences</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Registers preferences for formal or colloquial language.</li>
<li>Adjusts to preferences for short or long-form answers.</li>
