<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-humanitys-existential-crisis">Introduction: Humanity’s Existential Crisis</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Humanity’s Power vs.&nbsp;Wisdom</strong>: Despite accumulating immense power through discoveries, inventions, and conquests over the past 100,000 years, humanity faces an existential crisis.
<ul>
<li><strong>Ecological Collapse</strong>: Misuse of power has led to the brink of ecological collapse.</li>
<li><strong>Technological Threats</strong>: Technologies like AI have the potential to enslave or annihilate us.</li>
<li><strong>Global Conflict</strong>: Rising international tensions and the possibility of a new world war further threaten our survival.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Information Overload</strong>: Despite vast amounts of information, we haven’t answered fundamental questions about our purpose and meaning.</li>
<li><strong>Susceptibility to Delusion</strong>: Even modern societies remain vulnerable to mass delusions, as demonstrated by Nazism and Stalinism.</li>
<li><strong>The Core Question</strong>: Why are we so adept at accumulating information and power but less successful at acquiring wisdom?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-allure-of-uncontrolled-power" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-allure-of-uncontrolled-power">The Allure of Uncontrolled Power</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Historical Narratives</strong>: Many traditions suggest a fatal flaw in human nature leads us to pursue power beyond our control.
<ul>
<li><strong>The Myth of Phaeton</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Phaeton, son of the sun god Helios, insists on driving the sun chariot despite warnings.</li>
<li>His inability to control the chariot leads to widespread destruction.</li>
<li>Zeus intervenes to save the world, killing Phaeton.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Goethe’s “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice”</strong>:
<ul>
<li>An apprentice uses a spell to enchant a broom to fetch water.</li>
<li>He loses control, leading to a flood.</li>
<li>The sorcerer returns to break the spell and restore order.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Lesson</strong>: These fables warn against summoning powers we cannot control.</li>
<li><strong>Humanity’s Disregard for Warnings</strong>:
<ul>
<li>We have disrupted the Earth’s climate.</li>
<li>We have created technologies (drones, chatbots, algorithms) that may escape our control.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Fables’ Shortcomings</strong>:
<ul>
<li>They offer no solutions beyond relying on divine intervention.</li>
<li>They fail to acknowledge that “gods and sorcerers” are human constructs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Invention of Religion</strong>: The tendency to create powerful things with unintended consequences began with religion, with prophets summoning spirits that sometimes caused harm.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-network-problem-power-cooperation-and-delusion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-network-problem-power-cooperation-and-delusion">The Network Problem: Power, Cooperation, and Delusion</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The True Source of Power</strong>: Human power stems from large-scale cooperation, not individual initiative.</li>
<li><strong>Human Nature’s Complexity</strong>: Alongside greed and cruelty, humans are capable of love, compassion, and humility.</li>
<li><strong>The Question of Power Entrustment</strong>: Why do societies sometimes entrust power to their worst members (e.g., Hitler’s rise)?</li>
<li><strong>The Root of the Problem</strong>: Our tendency to summon uncontrolled powers arises from the unique way our species cooperates in large numbers.</li>
<li><strong>The Book’s Central Argument</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Humanity gains power by building large networks of cooperation.</li>
<li>The way these networks are built predisposes us to misuse that power.</li>
<li>Our problem is a <strong>network problem</strong>, specifically an <strong>information problem</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Information’s Role</strong>: Information is the glue that holds networks together.</li>
<li><strong>Fictions and Fantasies</strong>: For millennia, sapiens built networks by inventing and spreading fictions and delusions about gods, technologies, and other things.</li>
<li><strong>Individual Truth vs.&nbsp;Network Order</strong>: While individuals seek truth, large networks rely on fictions and fantasies for cohesion and order.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Delusional Networks</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Nazism and Stalinism, held together by deluded ideas, were exceptionally powerful networks.</li>
<li>They came close to achieving global dominance.</li>
<li>We should not assume delusional networks are destined to fail.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Preventing Totalitarianism</strong>: We must actively work to prevent the triumph of such networks.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-naive-view-of-information-an-overly-optimistic-perspective">The Naive View of Information: An Overly Optimistic Perspective</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding Information Networks</strong>: It’s crucial to understand how large information networks operate, whether delusional or not.</li>
<li><strong>The Naive View</strong>: This perspective presents an overly optimistic view of large-scale human networks.
<ul>
<li><strong>Information Leads to Truth</strong>: It argues that big networks, by gathering vast amounts of information, achieve a better understanding of the world, leading to both power and wisdom.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Healthcare systems using information on pathogens to develop effective medicines and make wiser decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Ignorance’s Weakness</strong>: It implies that delusional networks are temporary aberrations, as they are bound to lose to more informed rivals in the long run.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Acknowledging Errors</strong>: The naive view recognizes that errors can occur in gathering and processing information, due to mistakes, malicious actors, or disinformation.</li>
<li><strong>More Information as the Antidote</strong>: It assumes that gathering more information is the solution to such errors.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Thousands of doctors analyzing data from millions of patients are more likely to correctly identify a disease’s cause than a single doctor examining one patient.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency’s Power</strong>: Making information public can expose deception.</li>
<li><strong>Network Size and Truth</strong>: The bigger the information network, the closer it is to the truth, according to this view.</li>
<li><strong>Values and Wisdom</strong>: Even accurate information doesn’t guarantee wise decisions, as wisdom involves value judgments that vary across individuals and cultures.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Scientific knowledge used to develop bioweapons instead of vaccines due to racist ideologies.</li>
<li><strong>Information as a Remedy for Value Conflicts</strong>: The naive view believes disagreements about values stem from a lack of information or disinformation.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Racists are seen as ill-informed, needing more facts to overcome their biases.</li>
<li><strong>The Core Tenet</strong>: Information is fundamentally good, and more information is always better.</li>
<li><strong>Discovering Truth</strong>: Given enough information and time, we will inevitably discover the truth, leading to both power and wisdom.</li>
<li><strong>Justifying Technology</strong>: This view justifies pursuing ever more powerful information technologies.</li>
<li><strong>The Ideology of the Computer Age</strong>: This perspective has been the dominant ideology of the computer age and the internet.</li>
<li><strong>Reagan’s Optimism</strong>: Ronald Reagan believed that information technology would bring down totalitarian regimes (1989).</li>
<li><strong>Obama’s Belief in Openness</strong>: Barack Obama advocated for the free flow of information, believing it strengthens societies (2009).</li>
<li><strong>Historical Examples</strong>:
<ul>
<li>An 1858 editorial in <em>The New Englander</em> suggested the telegraph would eliminate prejudices and hostilities.</li>
<li>Mark Zuckerberg stated Facebook’s goal is to promote openness and understanding through sharing (2010s).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Kurzweil’s Virtuous Circle</strong>: Ray Kurzweil argues that information technology inherently improves human well-being (2024).</li>
<li><strong>Google’s Mission</strong>: Google’s mission statement exemplifies the naive view, aiming to organize and make information universally accessible and useful.</li>
<li><strong>Google vs.&nbsp;Goethe</strong>: Google’s perspective suggests that widespread access to information will lead to both innovation and wise use of technology, unlike the single apprentice in Goethe’s tale.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="google-vs.-goethe-the-limitations-of-the-naive-view">Google vs.&nbsp;Goethe: The Limitations of the Naive View</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Successes of the Naive View</strong>: In some cases, more information has indeed led to better understanding and wiser use of power.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: <strong>Reduction in Child Mortality</strong>
<ul>
<li>Goethe’s family experienced high child mortality rates, common in the 18th century.</li>
<li>By 2020, child mortality rates had drastically declined globally, thanks to advances in medical knowledge and data sharing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Incomplete Picture</strong>: The naive view overlooks the downsides of the information explosion.</li>
<li><strong>Information Overload and Existential Threats</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Despite unprecedented access to information, humanity faces increasing existential threats:
<ul>
<li>Ecological collapse (greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, habitat destruction).</li>
<li>Weapons of mass destruction.</li>
<li>Escalating international tensions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Information hasn’t prevented these problems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The AI Dilemma</strong>: Will more information, specifically AI, make things better or worse?</li>
<li><strong>AI: Savior or Destroyer?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimists</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Marc Andreessen believes AI will solve humanity’s problems (2023).</li>
<li>Ray Kurzweil sees AI as the key to overcoming disease, poverty, and environmental degradation (2024).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Skeptics</strong>:
<ul>
<li>AI experts like Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and Mustafa Suleiman warn of AI’s potential to destroy civilization.</li>
<li>A 2024 article co-authored by Bengio and Hinton highlights the risks of unchecked AI advancement, including human extinction.</li>
<li>A 2023 survey revealed that over a third of AI researchers believe advanced AI has at least a 10% chance of causing human extinction.</li>
<li>The 2023 Bletchley Declaration on AI acknowledges the potential for serious harm from AI models.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>AI’s Potential Dangers</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Supercharging Conflicts</strong>: AI could exacerbate existing human conflicts, potentially leading to catastrophic wars.</li>
<li><strong>The Silicon Curtain</strong>: AI could divide humanity, not just between nations but also between humans and AI overlords, creating a world controlled by unfathomable algorithms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Totalitarian Potential of AI</strong>: AI poses a threat to all humans, regardless of nationality, as it has the potential to establish a totalitarian network run by non-human intelligence.</li>
<li><strong>AI’s Unique Capabilities</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision-Making</strong>: AI is the first technology capable of making independent decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Idea Generation</strong>: AI can generate new ideas in various fields, from music to medicine, even potentially creating new life forms.</li>
<li><strong>Current Impact</strong>: AI already influences decisions about mortgages, jobs, and imprisonment.</li>
<li><strong>The Gamble</strong>: Trusting AI to make wise decisions and create a better world is a significant gamble with potentially dire consequences for humanity and the evolution of all life.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="weaponizing-information-populisms-challenge-to-the-naive-view">Weaponizing Information: Populism’s Challenge to the Naive View</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Homo Deus and the Shifting Power of Information</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harari’s 2016 book, <em>Homo Deus</em>, warned about the potential dangers of information technologies, suggesting they might disempower humans and undermine our physical and mental health.</li>
<li>It hypothesized that humanity might dissolve within the torrent of information.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Accelerated Change</strong>: The pace of change has intensified since 2016, with power shifting from humans to algorithms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Science Fiction Turned Reality</strong>: Scenarios once considered science fiction, like AI creating art and making life decisions, are now commonplace.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Populism’s Rise</strong>: Populism has challenged the naive view of information, particularly in the late 2010s and early 2020s.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Populism’s Core Argument</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional institutions claiming authority based on information and truth are actually lying.</li>
<li>Elites (bureaucrats, judges, doctors, journalists, academics) are spreading disinformation for their own benefit.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Information as a Weapon</strong>: Populism views information primarily as a tool for power struggles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extreme Populism</strong>: Some versions of populism deny the existence of objective truth, claiming everyone has their own truth to use against rivals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Erosion of Language</strong>: When information is viewed solely as a weapon, words like “facts,” “accurate,” and “truthful” lose their meaning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Historical Precedents</strong>: This power-focused view of information isn’t new.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Radical Leftist Thought</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Michel Foucault and Edward Said argued that scientific institutions use power to define truth in service of elites (late 20th century).</li>
<li>Some even claimed that scientific facts are merely a capitalist or colonialist discourse.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Marxism</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Karl Marx argued that power is the only reality and information is a weapon (mid-19th century).</li>
<li>The <em>Communist Manifesto</em> (1848) presents history as a class struggle between oppressors and oppressed.</li>
<li>This view implies that every interaction is a power struggle, and the key question is not “Is it true?” but “Whose interests does it serve?”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Right-Wing Populism’s Marxist Underpinnings</strong>: Despite presenting themselves as anti-Marxist, right-wing populists like Trump and Bolsonaro share a similar view of society and information with Marxists.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Example</strong>: Trump’s inaugural address (2017) accusing a small group in Washington of reaping the rewards of government at the expense of the people.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Populism as Defined by Cas Mudde</strong>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“an ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into two homogenous and antagonistic groups, the pure people versus the corrupt elite.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Populist Accusations</strong>: Populists, like Marxists, accuse institutions like the media and universities of serving the interests of the elite.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Populism’s Incoherence</strong>: If power is the only reality and information is just a weapon, what does this imply about the populists themselves? Are they also power-hungry and lying?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Populist Attempts to Resolve the Paradox</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Radical Empiricism</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Some populists advocate for “doing your own research” and trusting only direct observation.</li>
<li>This implies that individuals can find truth, but large institutions cannot be trusted.</li>
<li>However, this makes large-scale cooperation for tasks like building healthcare systems or addressing climate change difficult, if not impossible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Divine Revelation and Mysticism</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Other populists reject the scientific pursuit of truth and rely on religious or mystical sources.</li>
<li>They argue that traditional scriptures hold absolute truth, while information from institutions like the <em>New York Times</em> or <em>Science</em> is a power play.</li>
<li>Some promote charismatic leaders like Trump and Bolsonaro as infallible messengers of God or possessing a mystical connection with the people.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The Paradox of Populism</strong>: It warns against power-hungry elites but often ends up concentrating power in the hands of a single ambitious individual.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Populism’s Impact</strong>: Populism erodes trust in institutions and international cooperation precisely when humanity needs them most to address existential challenges.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Populism’s Flawed Advice</strong>: It encourages reliance on divine intervention or charismatic leaders, mirroring the advice in the Phaeton myth and the sorcerer’s apprentice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Dangers of Populism</strong>: This approach could lead to control by power-hungry humans in the short term and AI overlords in the long term, potentially resulting in the collapse of civilization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Understanding Information</strong>: To avoid these outcomes, we need a better understanding of information, its role in building networks, and its relationship to truth and power.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Beyond the Extremes</strong>: There’s a middle ground between the naive view and the purely power-focused view of information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Book’s Purpose</strong>: This book aims to explore that middle ground, offering a more nuanced and hopeful perspective on human information networks and our capacity for wise use of power.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-road-ahead-exploring-the-past-present-and-future-of-information-networks">The Road Ahead: Exploring the Past, Present, and Future of Information Networks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part 1: Human Networks</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus</strong>: Historical development of human information networks.</li>
<li><strong>Approach</strong>: Examines key dilemmas faced by people in different eras when building information networks and how different solutions shaped societies.</li>
<li><strong>Mythology and Bureaucracy</strong>: Chapters 2 and 3 explore these two essential principles for large-scale networks, showing how they have been intertwined throughout history.</li>
<li><strong>The Tension Between Myth-Makers and Bureaucrats</strong>: Institutions often navigate the conflicting needs of these two groups.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: The Christian Church’s reliance on both biblical stories (mythology) and bureaucratic structures for its success and eventual division into different branches.</li>
<li><strong>Erroneous Information and Self-Correcting Mechanisms</strong>: Chapter 4 examines the problem of misinformation and the benefits and drawbacks of self-correcting systems like independent courts and peer-reviewed journals.</li>
<li><strong>Contrasting Examples</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The Catholic Church’s relatively weak self-correcting mechanisms.</li>
<li>Scientific disciplines’ strong self-correcting mechanisms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Impact of Self-Correction</strong>: Weak mechanisms can lead to disasters like witch hunts, while strong ones can destabilize the network.</li>
<li><strong>Distributed vs.&nbsp;Centralized Networks</strong>: Chapter 5 contrasts these two types of information networks.</li>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Democratic systems with decentralized information flows.</li>
<li>Totalitarian systems with centralized information control.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Advantages and Shortcomings</strong>: Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding Political Systems</strong>: Analyzing political systems like the US and USSR through the lens of information flow can illuminate their trajectories.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Importance of History</strong>: Studying the past is essential for understanding the present and future of information networks, particularly the rise of AI.</li>
<li><strong>History as the Study of Change</strong>: History teaches us what changes, what remains constant, and how change occurs, providing insights into information revolutions.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Parallels</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Understanding the canonization of the Bible can shed light on claims of AI infallibility.</li>
<li>Studying the witch hunts and Stalin’s collectivization offers warnings about the risks of giving AI control over society.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Understanding AI’s Uniqueness</strong>: Historical knowledge helps us recognize how AI fundamentally differs from previous technologies and how an AI dictatorship could be unprecedented.</li>
<li><strong>History’s Non-Deterministic Nature</strong>: The book doesn’t claim that history predicts the future. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of informed choices to prevent negative outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Part 2: The Inorganic Network</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus</strong>: The new information network being created today, centered on the political implications of AI.</li>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: Chapters 6-8 use recent examples, like the role of social media in ethnic violence in Myanmar (2016-17), to illustrate AI’s unique characteristics.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on the 2010s</strong>: Examples primarily from the 2010s are used due to the availability of some historical perspective.</li>
<li><strong>The Emergence of a New Network</strong>: We are building a new kind of information network without fully understanding its consequences.</li>
<li><strong>The Shift from Organic to Inorganic</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Past networks relied on human brains (carbon-based) to process information.</li>
<li>The new network is dominated by silicon-based computers that operate differently.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Silicon’s Advantages</strong>: Silicon chips overcome some limitations of organic brains, potentially creating tireless spies, infallible financiers, and immortal despots.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Part 3: Computer Politics</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus</strong>: How different societies might address the challenges and promises of the inorganic network.</li>
<li><strong>Human Control</strong>: Can humans understand and control this new network?</li>
<li><strong>Democracies and the Inorganic Network</strong>: Chapter 9 explores how democracies might navigate a world where AI increasingly influences finance, politics, and social interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges for Democracies</strong>:
<ul>
<li>How can human politicians make decisions in a financial system dominated by AI?</li>
<li>How can democracies maintain public discourse when chatbots can impersonate humans?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Totalitarianism and the Inorganic Network</strong>: Chapter 10 examines the impact of AI on totalitarian regimes.</li>
<li><strong>Dictators’ Fears</strong>: While dictators may appreciate AI’s control capabilities, they also face the threat of AI seizing power from them.</li>
<li><strong>The Global Balance of Power</strong>: Chapter 11 analyzes how the new network could affect the balance between democratic and totalitarian societies.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Outcomes</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Will AI favor one type of society?</li>
<li>Will the world fragment into hostile blocks vulnerable to an out-of-control AI?</li>
<li>Can humanity unite to defend common interests?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Fundamental Question</strong>: Before delving into these explorations, we must first address the seemingly simple but crucial question: What exactly is information?</li>
</ul>

<section id="defining-information" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="defining-information">Defining Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>Defining fundamental concepts like information is challenging because they lack a clear basis, much like defining matter, energy, life, or reality.</li>
<li>Information is increasingly viewed as a foundational element of reality, potentially more fundamental than matter and energy.</li>
<li>This book focuses on the definition and role of <strong>information in history</strong> within human societies.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="everyday-usage-and-examples" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="everyday-usage-and-examples">Everyday Usage and Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>Information is commonly associated with <strong>human-made symbols</strong>, such as spoken or written words.</li>
<li><strong>Example: The Story of Cher Ami and the Lost Battalion (October 1918)</strong>
<ul>
<li>An American battalion was trapped behind enemy lines in World War I.</li>
<li>Their commander, Major Charles Whittlesey, needed to inform headquarters of their location to avoid friendly fire.</li>
<li>A carrier pigeon, Cher Ami, was used to deliver a message: “We are along the road parallel 276.4. Our artillery is dropping a barrage directly on us. For heaven’s sake, stop it.”</li>
<li>Cher Ami flew through heavy fire, was injured, but successfully delivered the message, saving the battalion.</li>
<li>Cher Ami became a symbol of heroism.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Information does not have to consist of human-made symbols.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Noah’s dove returning with an olive branch, indicating receding floodwaters (Biblical myth).</li>
<li>The rainbow as a symbol of God’s promise.</li>
<li>The shapes and movements of galaxies providing information about the universe’s history (to astronomers).</li>
<li>The North Star indicating direction (to navigators).</li>
<li>Stars conveying information about the future (to astrologers).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Defining something as information is <strong>context-dependent</strong>.
<ul>
<li>What one observer considers information might not be viewed as such by another.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Libra constellation: information to astronomers and astrologers, but potentially meaningless to other life forms.</li>
<li>A piece of paper with ink splotches: crucial information to an army unit, or food to termites.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Any object can be information, or not.</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>ambivalence of information</strong> has been utilized in espionage.</li>
<li><strong>Example: The Nili Spy Ring (World War I)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Pro-British Jews in Palestine signaled to British ships using window shutters in a pre-determined code.</li>
<li>The shutters were visible to many, but only understood as information by Nili agents and British operators.</li>
<li>Nili also used carrier pigeons to convey coded messages.</li>
<li>One pigeon was captured by an Ottoman officer, revealing the existence of the spy ring.</li>
<li>The pigeons themselves became incriminating information, leading to their extermination by Nili agents.</li>
<li>The spy ring was eventually discovered, and Sarah Aronson, a Nili commander, committed suicide.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="the-naive-view-of-information" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-naive-view-of-information">The Naive View of Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>naive view of information</strong> argues that objects are defined as information in the context of truth-seeking.</li>
<li>This view links information to the concept of <strong>truth</strong> and assumes information’s main role is to <strong>represent reality</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Information provided by Nili was meant to represent the reality of Ottoman troop movements.</li>
<li>Accurate information could help the British win battles, while inaccurate information could lead to mistakes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The naive view argues that <strong>information is an attempt to represent reality</strong>, and successful representation is called <strong>truth</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="what-is-truth" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-truth">What is Truth?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Truth</strong> is understood as something that accurately represents certain aspects of reality.</li>
<li>The notion of truth assumes the existence of a single, <strong>universal reality</strong>.</li>
<li>Truth and reality are distinct. Truthful accounts can never represent reality in all its aspects.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Saying there are 10,000 Ottoman soldiers in Gaza neglects details like experience, health, ethnicity, and individual personalities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reality includes both objective and subjective levels.
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective level:</strong> Objective facts that are independent of beliefs (e.g., Sarah Aronson’s death date).</li>
<li><strong>Subjective level:</strong> Subjective facts like beliefs and feelings (e.g., differing perspectives on Aronson’s actions).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Even subjective facts can be truthful or false.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Israelis generally view Aronson as a hero, while Palestinians may view her as an imperialist agent. Both are subjective facts.</li>
<li>Claiming Aronson is universally admired is false.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Individuals have unique perspectives shaped by their experiences.</li>
<li>Truthful accounts cannot represent all viewpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Borges’ story “On Exactitude in Science” illustrates the absurdity of a one-to-one map of reality.</li>
<li><strong>Truth is not a one-to-one representation of reality but something that brings attention to certain aspects while ignoring others.</strong></li>
<li>No account is 100% accurate, but some are more truthful than others.</li>

<section id="what-information-does" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-information-does">What Information Does</h3>
<ul>
<li>The naive view sees information as an attempt to represent reality.</li>
<li>It acknowledges <strong>misinformation</strong> (honest mistakes) and <strong>disinformation</strong> (deliberate lies) but sees them as exceptions.</li>
<li>It believes the solution to misinformation and disinformation is <strong>more information</strong> (the counter-speech doctrine).</li>
<li>This book disagrees with the naive view.</li>
<li><strong>Information’s defining characteristic is not representing reality, but creating new realities by connecting things.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Information is whatever connects different points into a network.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Information doesn’t necessarily inform us about things; it puts things in formation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Example: Astrology</strong>
<ul>
<li>Astrology has had a significant historical impact, despite its questionable accuracy.</li>
<li>It connects people and influences decisions.</li>
<li>As of 2021, the global astrology market was valued at $12.8 billion.</li>
<li>Astrology was highly regarded in the Roman Empire, even influencing emperors’ decisions.</li>
<li>Some modern governments still consult astrologers (e.g., Myanmar’s capital relocation in 2005).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Errors, lies, fantasies, and fictions are information too.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Information has no essential link to truth.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Example: Music</strong>
<ul>
<li>Music doesn’t represent reality but connects people, synchronizing emotions and movements.</li>
<li>Music can influence soldiers, clubbers, congregations, and sports fans.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Information’s connecting role is not unique to human history; it’s crucial in biology too.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Example: DNA</strong>
<ul>
<li>DNA does not represent reality; it produces new things.</li>
<li>It initiates chemical processes, such as adrenaline production.</li>
<li>Adrenaline doesn’t represent reality; it connects cells into a functional network.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>DNA errors (mutations) don’t always reduce fitness; they can increase it, driving evolution.</strong></li>
<li><strong>All life forms exist thanks to genetic errors.</strong></li>
<li><strong>DNA creates new realities, not representations.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Information creates new realities by connecting different points into a network.</strong></li>
<li>Truthful representations can connect people (e.g., the moon landing broadcast).</li>
<li>Erroneous representations can also connect people (e.g., conspiracy theories).</li>
<li>Networks can be connected without any representation of reality (e.g., DNA, music).</li>
<li><strong>Example: The Metaverse</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Metaverse is a virtual universe made entirely of information.</li>
<li>It’s not an attempt to represent our world but to augment or replace it.</li>
<li>It invites the creation of new virtual communities.</li>
<li>It may become a dominant space for social and professional activities.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="information-in-human-history" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="information-in-human-history">Information in Human History</h3>
<ul>
<li>Viewing information as a social nexus explains historical phenomena that confound the naive view.</li>
<li><strong>Example: The Bible</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Bible has had a profound historical influence despite containing factual errors.</li>
<li><strong>Errors:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Claims all humans descend from a single Middle Eastern family (contradicted by genetic and archaeological evidence).</li>
<li>Depicts epidemics as divine punishment (contradicted by scientific understanding).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Connecting power:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Bible has connected billions of people, creating religious networks.</li>
<li>Religious networks, like biological networks, can achieve things individuals cannot.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Information always connects, but it doesn’t always represent reality accurately.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The crucial questions are often about how well information connects people and what new networks it creates.</strong></li>
<li>Rejecting the naive view does not necessitate rejecting truth.</li>
<li>Some information strives to connect through accurate representation, but this requires effort.</li>
<li><strong>Creating more powerful information technology does not automatically lead to a more truthful understanding of the world.</strong></li>
<li><strong>An increase in information volume and speed, without efforts to prioritize truth, can overwhelm truthful accounts with less accurate information.</strong></li>
<li>The history of information shows a constant rise in connectivity, not necessarily in truthfulness or wisdom.</li>
<li><strong>Homo sapiens’ success is due to our ability to use information to connect individuals, not our ability to accurately map reality.</strong></li>
<li>This ability often coexists with believing in lies, errors, and fantasies.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union</strong>
<ul>
<li>These technologically advanced societies held mass delusions that strengthened their internal connections.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sapiens-unique-ability-flexible-cooperation">Sapiens’ Unique Ability: Flexible Cooperation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Homo sapiens</strong> dominate the world not due to superior intelligence, but because of their unique ability to <strong>cooperate flexibly in large numbers</strong>.</li>
<li>This ability has precursors in other animals:
<ul>
<li>Social mammals like <strong>chimpanzees</strong> demonstrate flexibility in cooperation.</li>
<li>Social insects like <strong>ants</strong> cooperate in vast numbers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, neither chimps nor ants establish complex societal structures like empires, religions, or trade networks.</li>
<li>Sapiens surpass chimps in flexibility and ants in the scale of cooperation.</li>
<li>There’s <strong>no upper limit</strong> to the number of sapiens who can cooperate:
<ul>
<li>Catholic Church: ~1.4 billion members</li>
<li>China: ~1.4 billion citizens</li>
<li>Global trade network: ~8 billion participants</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-role-of-stories-in-large-scale-cooperation">The Role of Stories in Large-Scale Cooperation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Humans can’t form <strong>long-term intimate bonds</strong> with more than a few hundred individuals.
<ul>
<li>Building trust and affection requires time and shared experiences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If cooperation relied solely on personal bonds, human networks would remain small, like those of chimpanzees (20-200 members).</li>
<li>Ancient humans, including <strong>Neanderthals</strong> and early Homo sapiens, likely faced similar limitations.</li>
<li><strong>~70,000 years ago</strong>: Homo sapiens bands began demonstrating unprecedented cooperation.
<ul>
<li>Evidence: inter-band trade, artistic traditions, rapid global spread.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Evolutionary changes</strong> in brain structure and language enabled this shift.</li>
<li><strong>Stories</strong>: Sapiens developed the ability to tell, believe, and be moved by <strong>fictional stories</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Human-to-story chains</strong>: Instead of relying solely on human-to-human connections, stories became a new form of linkage.
<ul>
<li>Cooperation no longer required personal acquaintance, only shared knowledge of a story.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A single story can connect billions:
<ul>
<li>Catholic Church: connected by the Bible and Christian narratives.</li>
<li>China: connected by stories of communist ideology and Chinese nationalism.</li>
<li>Global trade network: connected by narratives about currencies, corporations, and brands.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Charismatic leaders</strong> with millions of followers are not an exception to the rule of story-based connections.
<ul>
<li>Followers connect to a <strong>carefully crafted story</strong> about the leader, not the leader themselves.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Joseph Stalin</strong> understood this concept: “Stalin is Soviet power. Stalin is what he is in the newspapers and the portraits. Not you. No, not even me.”</li>
<li>Modern <strong>influencers and celebrities</strong> demonstrate this principle.
<ul>
<li>Social media accounts are managed by teams, creating a curated <strong>brand</strong> – a specific type of story.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Branding</strong>: Telling a story about a product or individual that may not reflect reality but creates associations in consumers’ minds.
<ul>
<li>Example: Coca-Cola’s decades-long investment in advertisements associating their drink with fun, happiness, and youth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Branding can be applied to individuals as well:
<ul>
<li>A corrupt billionaire branded as a champion of the poor.</li>
<li>A bungling individual branded as a genius.</li>
<li>An abusive guru branded as a saint.</li>

<li>The story of <strong>Jesus</strong> is an extreme example of how storytelling can obscure historical truth.</li>
<li>Two millennia of narratives have made it impossible to separate the historical person from the story.</li>
<li>The <strong>real Jesus</strong>: Likely a typical Jewish preacher with a small following, executed as a criminal.</li>
<li><strong>Post-mortem branding</strong>: Jesus was rebranded as the incarnation of the cosmic God.</li>

<li>The Jesus story:
<ul>
<li>Presented Jesus as a parental figure for all humans.</li>
<li>Encouraged Christians to view each other as siblings.</li>
<li>Created a shared pool of “family memories” (e.g., the Last Supper).</li>

<li><strong>Jewish Passover</strong>: A ritual that intentionally creates and reenacts artificial memories of the exodus from Egypt.</li>
<li>The <strong>Haggadah</strong>: Insists that every generation should feel as if they personally experienced the exodus.</li>
<li><strong>Jewish sages</strong>: Claim that the souls of all Jews were present at Mount Sinai, making the Passover remembrance literal, not metaphorical.</li>
<li><strong>Salvador Litvak</strong>: “When we fulfill the obligation to see ourselves as if we personally left Egypt, it’s not a metaphor. We don’t imagine the exodus, we remember it.”</li>

<ul>
<li>Stories can create entirely new entities and a new level of reality: <strong>intersubjective reality</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Two pre-existing levels of reality</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective reality</strong>: Things that exist independently of our awareness (e.g., stones, mountains, asteroids).</li>
<li><strong>Subjective reality</strong>: Things that exist within our awareness (e.g., pain, pleasure, love).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Intersubjective reality</strong>: Exists in the nexus of many minds, created and sustained by shared stories.
<ul>
<li>Examples: laws, gods, nations, corporations, currencies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Intersubjective things exist because people talk about them; they disappear if people stop talking about them.</li>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Pizza</strong>: Caloric value (objective) vs.&nbsp;financial value (intersubjective).
<ul>
<li><strong>Laszlo Haniecz</strong>: Bought two pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoins in 2010 (worth ~$690 million in 2021).</li>
<li>Bitcoin’s value is an intersubjective reality dependent on shared beliefs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Loch Ness Monster</strong>: A question of objective reality (does it exist?).
<ul>
<li>Scientific consensus: No evidence of a monster.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>States</strong>: Intersubjective entities.
<ul>
<li>Disagreements about their existence highlight their intersubjective nature (e.g., Israel-Palestine conflict, Kosovo, Abkhazia).</li>
<li>The existence of a state depends on sufficient agreement among people.</li>

<li>Stories, especially those creating intersubjective realities, are crucial for large-scale human networks.</li>
<li><strong>Religions and empires</strong>: Rely on shared beliefs in gods, nations, laws, and currencies.</li>
<li><strong>Christian church</strong>: Recollection of Jesus’ teachings was important, but believing in his divinity was crucial.</li>
<li><strong>Jewish religion</strong>: Remembering the exodus was helpful, but adherence to the <strong>halakha</strong> (religious law code) was decisive.</li>
<li>Intersubjective things are powerful within a network but meaningless outside it.

<ul>
<li>Story-based networks contributed to Homo sapiens’ dominance over other animals and human species.</li>
<li><strong>Neanderthals</strong>: Lived in small, isolated bands with limited cooperation.</li>
<li><strong>Stone Age sapiens</strong>: Initially lived in similar bands.</li>
<li><strong>Storytelling</strong>: Enabled sapiens bands to connect through shared beliefs (e.g., ancestors, totems, spirits).</li>
<li><strong>Tribes</strong>: Networks of interconnected bands sharing stories and intersubjective realities.</li>
<li><strong>Tribal advantages</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Strength in numbers during conflict (e.g., 500 sapiens vs.&nbsp;50 Neanderthals).</li>
<li><strong>Insurance policy</strong>: Mutual support during crises (e.g., drought, migration).</li>
<li><strong>Information exchange</strong>: Sharing knowledge and innovations (e.g., toolmaking, medicine).</li>

<li>Material interests don’t fully explain the identities and actions of rival groups.</li>
<li><strong>Intersubjective identities</strong>: There are no objective definitions of national or religious identities; they are shaped by stories.</li>
<li>Chimpanzees share humans’ objective material interests but lack large-scale groups due to an inability to create connecting stories.</li>

<ul>
<li>Because history is shaped by intersubjective stories, conflict resolution can be achieved through dialogue and changing shared narratives.</li>
<li><strong>Example: The rise of Nazism</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Material interests (e.g., economic crisis) played a role, but it wasn’t inevitable.</li>
<li>Millions of Germans chose to believe the Nazi story over alternatives.</li>
<li>Nazism was a tragic mistake, as it led to devastation, not improved material interests.</li>
<li>Germans could have chosen different stories (e.g., liberal democracy) earlier.</li>

<ul>
<li>The centrality of stories reveals that <strong>power doesn’t always align with wisdom</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Naive view of information</strong>: Information leads to truth, which leads to power and wisdom.</li>
<li><strong>Reality</strong>: Power stems from both knowing the truth and maintaining social order.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Atom bomb</strong>: Requires knowledge of physics (truth) and the cooperation of millions (order).</li>
<li><strong>Ideologies</strong>: Ignoring facts about the universe may not prevent an ideology from being powerful.</li>
<li>Those who can build ideologies and maintain order often control those who possess technical expertise.</li>
<li><strong>Fictional stories</strong>, especially about intersubjective entities, are often more effective at uniting people than the truth.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages of fiction over truth</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Fiction can be simplified, while truth is often complex.</li>
<li><strong>Palatability</strong>: Fiction can be molded to be comforting, while truth can be painful and disturbing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Plato’s noble lie</strong>: A fictional story about the origins of social order to ensure loyalty and prevent questioning.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="telling-fictional-stories-vs.-lying">Telling Fictional Stories vs.&nbsp;Lying</h3>
<ul>
<li>Telling a fictional story isn’t inherently lying.</li>
<li><strong>Lying</strong>: Pretending that a fictional story is a true representation of reality.</li>
<li><strong>Not lying</strong>: Acknowledging that a story is fictional and aims to create a new intersubjective reality.</li>
<li><strong>Example: U.S. Constitution</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A creative legal fiction, not a pre-existing truth or a lie.</li>
<li>Authors acknowledged its human origin: “We the People… do ordain and establish this Constitution.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Constitution’s success</strong>: Formed a powerful and enduring union, maintaining order among diverse groups.</li>
<li><strong>Order vs.&nbsp;Justice</strong>: The order created by the Constitution initially condoned slavery, subordination of women, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Amendment mechanism</strong>: The Constitution’s acknowledgment of its human origin allowed for amendments to address injustices (e.g., Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery).</li>
<li><strong>Contrast with the Ten Commandments</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Claimed divine origin, preventing amendments.</li>
<li>Endorsed slavery without a mechanism for change.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Opening statements</strong>:
<ul>
<li>US Constitution: “We the People” (human origin, amendable).</li>
<li>Ten Commandments: “I am the Lord your God” (divine origin, unchangeable).</li>

<ul>
<li>A complete model of information networks must consider both truth and order.</li>
<li><strong>Information networks need to</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Process information to gain accurate understanding (truth).</li>
<li>Use information to maintain social order (order).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These processes can be contradictory, as maintaining order through fictions is often easier.</li>
<li><strong>Societies often prioritize order over truth</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Religions claim objective truth, suppressing challenges to their narratives.</li>
<li>Ignorance is sometimes seen as strength.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Darwin’s theory of evolution</strong>: An example of truth threatening social order.</li>
<li><strong>Selective truth-seeking</strong>: Networks may encourage truth-seeking only in fields that enhance power without challenging the social order.</li>
<li><strong>Nazi Germany</strong>: Cultivated scientific expertise (e.g., rocket science) while suppressing dissent on racist ideologies.</li>
<li><strong>Power doesn’t equal wisdom</strong>: Networks prioritizing order over truth can become powerful but unwise.</li>
<li><strong>History of information networks</strong>: A tightrope walk between truth and order, not a simple march of progress.</li>
<li><strong>21st century</strong>: The need to balance truth and order remains urgent, especially with rapid advancements in information technology.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-role-of-storytelling-in-zionism">The Role of Storytelling in Zionism</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chaim Nachman Bialik</strong> (Ukrainian Jew, Israel’s national poet):
<ul>
<li>Poems and stories (1890s - early 1900s) lamented the persecution of European Jews and called for self-defense, immigration to Palestine, and the establishment of a Jewish state.</li>
<li>“In the City of Slaughter” (1903, following the Kishinev pogrom):
<ul>
<li>Condemned both the anti-Semitic mob and Jewish pacifism.</li>
<li>Described the brutal realities of the pogrom, including the rape of Jewish women while men hid.</li>
<li>Became mandatory reading in Israeli schools, highlighting the shift in Jewish identity towards military might.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bialik’s focus on European Jewish persecution and limited understanding of Palestine contributed to the later Arab-Israeli conflict.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Theodor Herzl</strong> (Hungarian Jew, visionary of the state):
<ul>
<li>Organized the Zionist movement in the late 1800s and early 1900s.</li>
<li>Published two influential books:
<ul>
<li><em>The Jewish State</em> (1896): Manifesto outlining the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine.</li>
<li><em>The Old New Land</em> (1902): Utopian novel set in 1923 depicting a prosperous Jewish state in Palestine (Hebrew title: <em>Tel Aviv</em>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Both books largely ignored the existing realities in Palestine, including the demographic makeup.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Power of Mythology</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Bialik and Herzl relied heavily on Biblical stories and 19th-century European nationalist myths.</li>
<li>Their narratives, while inspiring, overlooked crucial facts like the small Jewish population in Palestine (6-9% of 600,000 in 1900).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Need for Lists</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Dreams and stories are insufficient for building a nation-state. Practical tasks like taxation, infrastructure, and public services require concrete data management.</li>
<li>This necessitates <strong>lists</strong>, which, unlike stories, are often dry and difficult to remember.</li>
<li><strong>Patriotism</strong> is ultimately about paying taxes to support essential services for all citizens.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Rise of Lists</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Lists</strong>, in various forms (itemized records, tables, spreadsheets), became crucial for managing finances in complex societies.</li>
<li>They are essential for taxation systems, corporations, banks, stock markets, and any organization needing to balance its budget.</li>
<li>Lists and stories are complementary: myths legitimize tax records, while tax records help turn aspirations into tangible realities (schools, hospitals, etc.).</li>
<li>Finance also relies on both stories (to create belief in currencies and attract investment) and lists (to manage banks, budgets, and startups).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Human Brain and Information Processing</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Human brains are adapted to absorbing, retaining, and processing information in the form of stories.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: The <em>Ramayana</em>, a 24,000-verse Hindu epic, has been memorized and recited for generations. Its 1987-88 TV adaptation was hugely popular, demonstrating the ease with which humans follow complex narratives.</li>
<li><strong>Kendall Haven</strong> (<em>Story Proof, The Science Behind the Startling Power of Story</em>, 2007):
<ul>
<li>“Human minds rely on stories and on story architecture as the primary roadmap for understanding, making sense of, remembering, and planning our lives. Lives are like stories because we think in story terms.”</li>
<li>Haven’s research (citing over 120 academic studies) concludes that stories are highly efficient for communicating various types of information.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In contrast, most people struggle to remember lists, highlighting a fundamental difference in how the brain processes information.</li>
<li>Mnemonic methods for memorizing lists often involve turning them into stories.</li>
<li>Complex national systems require a different, non-organic information technology: the <strong>written document</strong>.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-invention-of-the-written-document">The Invention of the Written Document</h3>
<ul>
<li>The written document was independently invented in multiple locations.</li>
<li><strong>Ancient Mesopotamia</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: A cuneiform clay tablet from Ur (circa 2053-54 BCE) recorded monthly deliveries of sheep and goats during the reign of King Shulgi.
<ul>
<li>The tablet lists specific deliveries (e.g., 15 sheep on the second day, 7 on the third, etc.).</li>
<li>It states a total of 896 animals received, but modern calculations reveal a scribal error (the actual total is 898).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Documents and Reality</strong>:
<ul>
<li>While not always accurate, written documents created new realities.</li>
<li>They facilitated the creation of administrative systems, kingdoms, religious organizations, and trade networks by recording properties, taxes, and payments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Documents and Intersubjective Realities</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Oral cultures</strong>: Intersubjective realities were created and maintained through shared stories, limited by human memory capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Literate cultures</strong>: Documents transcended this limitation by externalizing information.</li>
<li>The documents themselves became the reality, providing precedents and models that would later be used by computers.</li>
<li><strong>Computers’ ability to create intersubjective realities is an extension of the power of written documents</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example: Ownership</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Oral communities</strong>: Ownership was a shared understanding maintained through continuous communication within the community, limiting central authority’s control and favoring communal property rights.</li>
<li><strong>Literate states</strong>: Ownership increasingly relied on written records. Official documents could override communal understanding, enabling central control, absolute property rights, and easier transfer of ownership (e.g., selling land).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Documents as Living Things (Ancient Assyria)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The Assyrian language treated documents as living entities that could be “killed” (duakum).</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Loan contracts were “killed” by destroying the tablet upon repayment, signifying the end of the debt.</li>
<li>The document was the reality, not just a representation of it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Money as a Document</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Money functions similarly. If a $100 bill is destroyed, the $100 ceases to exist.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Power of Documents</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Documents, by creating intersubjective realities, became foundational for social, economic, and political relations.</li>
<li>The careful wording of constitutions, treaties, and contracts reflects the power these documents wield.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="bureaucracy-the-retrieval-problem" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bureaucracy-the-retrieval-problem">Bureaucracy: The Retrieval Problem</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bottlenecks of New Technologies</strong>: Each new information technology solves some problems but creates new ones.</li>
<li><strong>The Retrieval Problem</strong>:
<ul>
<li>As document production increased, finding specific documents became challenging, particularly for institutions with large archives.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Brain vs.&nbsp;Document Retrieval</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The human brain is highly efficient at retrieving information stored within its complex network.</li>
<li>We can quickly recall details from personal experiences, national history, and religious mythology, despite the vast amount of information stored.</li>
<li>The exact mechanisms of memory storage and retrieval are still not fully understood by neuroscience.</li>
<li>However, millions of years of evolution have optimized the brain’s retrieval processes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Outsourcing Memory to Documents</strong>:
<ul>
<li>When memories are stored in external documents, retrieval becomes reliant on non-biological systems.</li>
<li>Human foraging abilities, evolved for finding things in the natural world, are not suited for finding documents in archives.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Order of Forests vs.&nbsp;Archives</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Forests are organized according to biological principles, making foraging possible.</li>
<li>Archives, lacking biological order, require an imposed order for effective retrieval.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bureaucracy as a Solution</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Bureaucracy</strong> emerged as the solution to the retrieval problem in large organizations, enabling the creation of larger and more powerful information networks.</li>
<li><strong>Bureaucracy</strong> (literally “rule by writing desk”) relies on dividing information into categories and containers (drawers, shelves, folders, etc.).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Price of Order</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Bureaucracy sacrifices truth for order, often imposing artificial categories onto a complex world.</li>
<li>This can lead to a distorted understanding of reality and the pursuit of narrow goals that ignore wider consequences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Examples of Bureaucratic Distortion</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Official forms</strong>: Individuals must adapt to the limitations of the form, even if their circumstances don’t fit neatly into the provided categories.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental pollution</strong>: A bureaucrat focused on industrial production might ignore environmental impacts, leading to unintended consequences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bureaucracy in Academia</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Universities are divided into faculties and departments, creating artificial separations between disciplines that don’t accurately reflect the interconnectedness of reality.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: COVID-19 is a historical, biological, and mathematical event, but academic study is fragmented across different departments.</li>
<li>Students are pressured to specialize, hindering holistic understanding.</li>
<li>The “publish or perish” culture further reinforces disciplinary boundaries, as journals are divided by subject and have specific conventions.</li>
<li>Interdisciplinary research and understanding often fall through the cracks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bureaucracy in Biology</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Defining Species</strong>: The concept of “species” is a bureaucratic category imposed on the fluidity of evolution.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges to Categorization</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Determining the boundaries between species is often ambiguous (e.g., the transition from <em>Homo erectus</em> to <em>Homo sapiens</em>).</li>
<li>Interbreeding and hybridization blur species boundaries (e.g., Neanderthal DNA in modern humans, pizzly bears, ligers).</li>
<li><strong>Horizontal gene transfer</strong> in bacteria and archaea further complicates categorization.</li>
<li><strong>Viruses</strong>: Challenge the very definition of life, highlighting the artificiality of the life/non-life boundary.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Power of Intersubjective Conventions</strong>:
<ul>
<li>While intersubjective conventions (like the definition of “species”) are not objective realities, they can have real-world consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Classifying a species as “endangered” can lead to legal protections and influence its survival.</li>
<li>Bureaucratic labels, even if based on convention, can determine outcomes, whether applied by human experts or AI systems.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-deep-state-the-benefits-of-bureaucracy">The Deep State: The Benefits of Bureaucracy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Order and Large-Scale Networks</strong>:
<ul>
<li>While bureaucracy can distort truth, it is often necessary for maintaining order in complex human networks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Alternatives to Bureaucracy</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Abolishing all bureaucracies in favor of a holistic approach might be impractical and even harmful in many cases.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Hospitals are bureaucratic institutions with their own limitations, but they still effectively treat illnesses.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Deep State as Essential Infrastructure</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Essential services like sewage systems, schools, and healthcare rely on bureaucratic structures.</li>
<li><strong>Sewage Systems</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The intricate network of pipes and infrastructure that manages waste is a crucial, often overlooked, aspect of modern society.</li>
<li>Maintaining this system requires bureaucratic organization and management.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Historical Example: Cholera in London (1854)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>John Snow</strong>, a physician, challenged the prevailing “bad air” theory of cholera by meticulously tracking and mapping cholera cases and their water sources.</li>
<li>His bureaucratic data collection identified the Broad Street pump as the source of the outbreak.</li>
<li>Disabling the pump effectively ended the outbreak, highlighting the life-saving potential of bureaucratic methods.</li>
<li>This led to the development of modern sewage systems and regulations, preventing countless deaths from waterborne diseases.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Clean India Mission (2014-2020)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s initiative to provide toilets for all Indian citizens addressed a major public health issue (open defecation).</li>
<li>This required significant bureaucratic effort and investment ($10 billion, over 100 million latrines built).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sewage systems, while unglamorous, are a crucial indicator of a functioning state</strong>.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-biological-dramas-and-the-challenge-of-understanding-bureaucracy">The Biological Dramas and the Challenge of Understanding Bureaucracy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mythology and Bureaucracy</strong>: The twin pillars of large-scale societies.</li>
<li><strong>Public Perception</strong>: Mythology often inspires fascination, while bureaucracy inspires suspicion.</li>
<li><strong>The Opacity of Bureaucracy</strong>: It’s difficult to determine whether a bureaucratic system is beneficial or malicious, as both share a common characteristic: they are hard for humans to understand.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency and Accountability</strong>:
<ul>
<li>It’s challenging for citizens to assess whether taxes are being used for public good or private gain.</li>
<li>Bureaucratic procedures in areas like education, healthcare, and waste management are often opaque and difficult to navigate.</li>
<li>It’s easy to make accusations of corruption, but proving or disproving them requires extensive effort.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shifting Information Flows and Power Dynamics</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Documents and bureaucratic procedures have altered information flow and power dynamics in society.</li>
<li>Understanding power becomes more complex in bureaucratic systems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Human Networks in Tribal vs.&nbsp;Bureaucratic Societies</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Tribal societies</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Networks are primarily composed of human-to-human and human-to-story chains.</li>
<li>Authority rests with those who control the foundational myths.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bureaucratic societies</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Networks include human-to-document chains.</li>
<li>Documents become a nexus of power, and expertise in managing documents (administrators, accountants, lawyers) becomes a source of authority.</li>
<li>Power shifts towards those who understand bureaucratic procedures and can navigate the system.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Centralization of Power</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Bureaucracy tends to strengthen central authority at the expense of ordinary citizens.</li>
<li>Documents and archives facilitate taxation, control, and conscription.</li>
<li>The opacity of bureaucratic power makes it harder for the public to influence, resist, or evade the central authority.</li>
<li>Even when benevolent, bureaucracy can widen the gap between rulers and the ruled due to information asymmetry.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Limitations of Art in Depicting Bureaucracy</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Art, while helpful in understanding many aspects of life, struggles to effectively portray bureaucratic power.</li>
<li>Artists often rely on <strong>biological dramas</strong> rooted in our evolutionary past, which are ill-suited for explaining bureaucracy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Biological Dramas</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Parental Neglect/Abandonment</strong>: Fear of being neglected by parents is a primal fear reflected in stories like Snow White, Cinderella, Harry Potter, and religious concepts like damnation.</li>
<li><strong>Sibling Rivalry</strong>: Competition for resources and parental attention is a common evolutionary theme, appearing in stories like Cain and Abel, King Lear, and Succession.</li>
<li><strong>Boy Meets Girl/Boy Fights Boy</strong>: Romantic rivalry is another deeply ingrained biological drama, found in countless myths and stories.</li>
<li><strong>Purity vs.&nbsp;Impurity</strong>: The evolutionary drive to avoid contamination manifests as a cultural obsession with purity.
<ul>
<li>National and religious myths often depict in-groups as pure bodies threatened by impure outsiders.</li>
<li>This has fueled prejudice against minorities, LGBTQ people, and women.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: The caste system in traditional Hinduism exemplifies the extreme application of purity concepts.</li>
<li><strong>Clean India Mission</strong>: Faced challenges due to caste-based reluctance to engage in “impure” activities related to sanitation.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Lynching of Dalit children (Roshni Valmiki and Avinash) in Bhagadi, India (2019) for defecating near the house of a higher-caste family, highlighting the deadly consequences of purity-based discrimination.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Other Biological Dramas</strong>: Who Will Be Alpha, Us vs.&nbsp;Them, Good vs.&nbsp;Evil.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Ramayana and Biological Dramas</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The <em>Ramayana</em> exemplifies the use of biological dramas:
<ul>
<li>Rama’s banishment: Parental neglect/abandonment, sibling rivalry.</li>
<li>Sita’s kidnapping: Boy Meets Girl, Boy Fights Boy.</li>
<li>Sita’s purity: Purity vs.&nbsp;Impurity.</li>
<li>Rama’s leadership: Who Will Be Alpha, Us vs.&nbsp;Them, Good vs.&nbsp;Evil.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Difficulty of Bureaucratic Narratives</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Biological dramas, while compelling, offer little insight into the workings of bureaucracy. Documents don’t experience sibling rivalry or romantic love.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Franz Kafka and the Horror of Bureaucracy</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Kafka’s stories, like <em>The Trial</em>, pioneered non-biological plotlines that captured the nightmarish aspects of bureaucracy.</li>
<li><em>The Trial</em>: K’s arrest and persecution by an unfathomable agency highlight the potential for individuals to be crushed by incomprehensible bureaucratic forces.</li>
<li>Kafka’s work reflects the anxieties of living in a bureaucratic society, where lives can be upended by unseen officials for unknown reasons.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Satirical Portrayals of Bureaucracy</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Joseph Heller’s <em>Catch-22</em></strong> (1961): Satirizes the absurdity of military bureaucracy, exemplified by ex-PFC Wintergreen’s control over mail flow.</li>
<li><strong>British sitcoms <em>Yes Minister</em> and <em>Yes Prime Minister</em></strong> (1980s): Showed how civil servants manipulate politicians using regulations and documents.</li>
<li><strong>The Big Short</strong> (2015): Explores the bureaucratic origins of the 2007-8 financial crisis, with <strong>collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)</strong> as the unseen villains.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Dominance of Biological Dramas in Popular Culture</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Despite efforts to depict bureaucracy, most popular entertainment still relies on Stone Age narratives (hero vs.&nbsp;monster, romantic pursuits).</li>
<li>Even political dramas often focus on family intrigue rather than the bureaucratic machinery of power.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Dangers of Opaque Power</strong>: The difficulty of understanding bureaucratic realities can leave people feeling helpless and vulnerable to unseen forces (like K in <em>The Trial</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Misconceptions of Bureaucracy</strong>: It can also fuel the perception of bureaucracy as inherently malicious, even when it provides essential services.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Examples of Anti-Bureaucratic Sentiment</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Ludovico Ariosto (16th century)</strong>: Described Discord as a woman surrounded by legal documents, causing insecurity for the poor.</li>
<li><strong>Shakespeare’s <em>Henry VI Part II</em></strong>: Dick the Butcher proposes killing all the lawyers to create a better society.</li>
<li><strong>Jack Cade’s Rebellion (1450)</strong>: Cade attacks the power of written documents, highlighting their ability to “undo a man.”</li>
<li><strong>Peasants’ Revolt (1381)</strong>: Rebels targeted archives, destroying records of debts and administrative control.
<ul>
<li><strong>Marjorie Starr</strong>: Symbolically scattered the ashes of the University of Cambridge archive, declaring “away with the learning of the clerks.”</li>
<li><strong>Thomas Walsingham</strong>: Chronicled the destruction of St.&nbsp;Albans Abbey’s archive, noting the rebels’ aim to erase evidence of their feudal obligations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Great Jewish Revolt (66 CE)</strong>: Rebels burned the central archive in Jerusalem to destroy debt records.</li>
<li><strong>French Revolution (1789)</strong>: Numerous archives were destroyed to erase evidence of past obligations and inequalities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Destroying Documents</strong>: Rebels, even if illiterate, understood that destroying documents could cripple the bureaucratic machine.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Example: Bruno Luttinger and the Romanian Jewish Census</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Harari’s grandfather’s life was dramatically affected by a bureaucratic census and the inability to access crucial documents.</li>
<li><strong>Romania in the 1930s</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Fascist government under <strong>Octavian Goga</strong> (poet and politician) used fabricated statistics and discriminatory laws to target Jews.</li>
<li><strong>Jewish Census (1938)</strong>: Required Jews to provide documentary proof of Romanian birth and citizenship, threatening statelessness for those who failed.</li>
<li>This created a bureaucratic nightmare for Romanian Jews:
<ul>
<li>Difficulty accessing documents (destroyed archives, documents held in foreign capitals).</li>
<li>Vague requirements and arbitrary application of the law.</li>
<li>Bribery and financial costs associated with the process.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consequences</strong>:
<ul>
<li>367,000 out of 758,000 Romanian Jews lost their citizenship.</li>
<li>Those who lost citizenship faced increased persecution and were more likely to be murdered during the Holocaust.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bruno’s Experience</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Initially dismissed the census as absurd.</li>
<li>His mother’s death and lack of immediate action led to the cancellation of his citizenship and job loss.</li>
<li>Faced immense difficulties escaping due to lack of documents.</li>
<li>Eventually escaped to Palestine in 1940, only to be imprisoned by the British as an illegal immigrant.</li>
<li>Gained Palestinian citizenship by enlisting in the British Army (1941-1945).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Legacy of Bureaucratic Persecution</strong>: Harari’s family developed a deep respect for the importance of preserving documents, as they could potentially be life-saving.</li>

<li><strong>The Dual Nature of Bureaucracy</strong>: It can be both harmful and beneficial, depending on its design and implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Quantity of Information vs.&nbsp;Benevolence</strong>: Simply increasing the amount of information in a network doesn’t guarantee its positive impact or make it easier to find the right balance between truth and order.</li>
<li><strong>Lessons for Future Information Networks</strong>: Understanding the historical interplay of truth and order in bureaucratic systems is crucial for designing and using AI-powered information networks.</li>
<li><strong>AI as Bureaucrat and Mythmaker</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Part 2 of the book will explore how AI is taking on the roles of both bureaucrat (data processing) and mythmaker (storytelling).</li>
<li>AI’s capabilities in these areas surpass human abilities, but raise new challenges and opportunities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Error Correction in Information Networks</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Before delving into AI, the next two chapters will examine how human information networks have dealt with errors.</li>
<li>This is crucial for understanding how to build AI systems that can identify and correct their own mistakes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Holy Books and Infallibility</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Holy books</strong> (e.g., the Bible, the Quran) represent an information technology claiming both completeness and infallibility.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-human-fallibility-and-the-search-for-correction">Introduction: Human Fallibility and the Search for Correction</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Idea</strong>: Humans are inherently fallible, and the need to correct errors is a fundamental aspect of human societies and mythologies.</li>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Christian Mythology</strong>: History is seen as an attempt to rectify Adam and Eve’s original sin.</li>
<li><strong>Marxist-Leninist Thought</strong>: The working class may misinterpret its own interests, requiring guidance from a vanguard party.</li>
<li><strong>Bureaucracy</strong>: Systems are designed to identify and correct errors, often through disciplinary bodies or commissions of inquiry.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenge</strong>: If humans are fallible, how can we trust the mechanisms designed to correct errors to be error-free themselves?</li>
<li><strong>Fantasy of Infallibility</strong>: Humans have sought superhuman or infallible mechanisms to identify and correct their mistakes.
<ul>
<li><strong>Modern Example</strong>: Elon Musk’s “Truth GPT” – an AI envisioned as a maximum truth-seeking entity.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Example</strong>: Religion.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Emergence of Religious Experts</strong>: Tribal societies often had specialized individuals responsible for communicating with superhuman entities.
<ul>
<li><strong>Bining People</strong>: <em>Agunga Raga</em> (spirit mediums).</li>
<li><strong>Kalapalo Tribe</strong>: <em>Anatao</em> (hereditary ritual officers).</li>
<li><strong>Celtic and Hindu Societies</strong>: Druids and Brahmins.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Institutionalization in Complex Societies</strong>: Priests and oracles underwent extensive training, becoming trusted authorities on divine communication.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: The Pythia, high priestess at the Temple of Apollo in Delphi (ancient Greece).</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability to Corruption</strong>: Religious institutions, staffed by humans, remained susceptible to error and manipulation.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Herodotus’ account of the Pythia being bribed to influence the Spartans against the Athenian tyrant Hippias.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Continued Reliance on Humans</strong>: Accessing the supposedly infallible gods still required trust in fallible human intermediaries.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Problem 1: Canonization</strong>: Who decides which texts are included in the holy book?
<ul>
<li><strong>Human Compilation</strong>: The first copy wasn’t divinely created; humans had to select and assemble the content.</li>
<li><strong>Hope for a Definitive Solution</strong>: The idea that a group of wise and trustworthy individuals could create a final, unchangeable canon.</li>

<li><strong>Not the Oldest Bible</strong>: A common misconception.</li>
<li><strong>Collection of Documents</strong>: ~900 texts, mostly from the last two centuries BCE, likely the archive of a Jewish sect.</li>
<li><strong>No Complete Bible</strong>: No scroll contains the entire Old Testament or suggests it was considered a unified database.</li>
<li><strong>Inclusion of Non-Canonical Texts</strong>: Texts like the Book of Enoch, which were later excluded from the canonical Bible.</li>
<li><strong>Variations in Canonical Texts</strong>: Differences in wording and content compared to the present-day version.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Deuteronomy 32.8 – “sons of God” vs.&nbsp;“sons of Israel.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Greek Septuagint</strong>: The oldest translation of the Bible (3rd-1st centuries BCE), also differs from the later canonical version.
<ul>
<li><strong>Inclusion of Apocryphal Books</strong>: Tobit, Judith, Sirach, Maccabees, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Variations in Length and Content</strong>: Longer Daniel and Esther, shorter Jeremiah, different wording in Deuteronomy 32.8.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Role of Rabbis</strong>: Jewish sages (<strong>rabbis</strong>) engaged in lengthy debates to establish the canonical database, deciding which texts were divinely inspired and which were not.</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing Debates</strong>: Agreement was largely reached by Jesus’ time, but some debates continued for centuries.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: The Song of Songs – Rabbi Akiva’s defense of its inclusion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Masoretic Era</strong>: Finalization of the canon, including wording, spelling, and pronunciation, occurred during the 7th-10th centuries CE.</li>
<li><strong>Lost Books</strong>: Some books mentioned in the Bible itself (e.g., the Book of Jasher, the Book of the Wars of the Lord) were lost and not included in the canon.</li>
<li><strong>Shifting Perceptions</strong>: After canonization, the role of human institutions in compiling the Bible was downplayed.
<ul>
<li><strong>Claim of Divine Origin</strong>: Orthodox Judaism maintained that God gave the Torah to Moses, and other parts were divinely inspired.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Benefits of the Book Technology</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Democratization of Religion</strong>: Widely available copies limited the power of human leaders.</li>
<li><strong>Prevention of Tampering</strong>: Numerous copies made it difficult to alter the text undetected.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Replacing Human Despotism</strong>: The infallible technology of the book was seen as guaranteeing the social order under divine sovereignty.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-institution-strikes-back-challenges-of-copying-and-interpretation">The Institution Strikes Back: Challenges of Copying and Interpretation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem 2: Copying Errors</strong>: The need for multiple copies introduced the possibility of unintentional changes during the copying process.</li>
<li><strong>Rabbinical Regulations</strong>: Strict rules were established to minimize copying errors.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Prohibition on pausing while writing God’s name.</li>
<li><strong>Rabbi Yishmael’s Warning</strong>: Emphasizing the gravity of even minor changes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Inevitability of Errors</strong>: Despite precautions, variations existed between ancient Bibles.</li>
<li><strong>Problem 3: Interpretation</strong>: Even with agreement on the text’s sanctity and wording, different interpretations could arise.</li>
<li><strong>Example 1: Sabbath Observance</strong>: The Bible prohibits work on the Sabbath, but doesn’t define “work” precisely.
<ul>
<li><strong>Rabbinical Rulings</strong>: Reading vs.&nbsp;tearing paper.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example 2: Mixing Meat and Dairy</strong>: Exodus 23.19 prohibits cooking a young goat in its mother’s milk.
<ul>
<li><strong>Literal vs.&nbsp;Broader Interpretation</strong>: The rabbinical ruling favored the broader interpretation, extending it to all meat and dairy products.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Problem 4: Changing Circumstances</strong>: Biblical laws often focused on specific contexts (e.g., lives of shepherds and farmers in Palestine), which became irrelevant for Jews living elsewhere.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Jewish communities in Alexandria faced challenges applying biblical laws to their urban, cosmopolitan lives.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of Rabbinical Authority</strong>: Debates over interpretation increased the power and prestige of rabbis, who became the new technocratic elite.</li>
<li><strong>Unintended Consequence</strong>: The attempt to bypass human institutions through the book technology led to the emergence of a new, powerful human institution – the rabbinate.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-mishnah-and-talmud-iterations-of-interpretation">The Mishnah and Talmud: Iterations of Interpretation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Canonization of the Mishnah</strong>: Rabbinical consensus on biblical interpretation was codified in the Mishnah (3rd century CE).</li>
<li><strong>Shifting Perceptions</strong>: The Mishnah itself came to be seen as divinely inspired, perhaps even composed by God.</li>
<li><strong>Continuing Debates</strong>: Arguments arose over the interpretation of the Mishnah.</li>
<li><strong>Canonization of the Talmud</strong>: Consensus on the Mishnah’s interpretation was compiled in the Talmud (5th-6th centuries CE).</li>
<li><strong>Unending Cycle</strong>: Debates then shifted to the interpretation of the Talmud.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthening of Rabbinical Authority</strong>: The dream of bypassing human institutions remained unfulfilled.</li>
<li><strong>Judaism’s Transformation</strong>: From a religion focused on rituals and sacrifices to an information religion obsessed with texts and their interpretation.</li>
<li><strong>Information as Reality</strong>: Rabbinical texts were seen as more important than physical actions, leading to the belief in the universe as an information sphere composed of words.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-split-bible-the-christian-challenge">The Split Bible: The Christian Challenge</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competing Chains of Texts</strong>: The canonization process didn’t create a single, universally accepted chain.</li>
<li><strong>Christian Dissent</strong>: Early Christians accepted Jehovah but rejected the authority of the rabbinical institution.</li>
<li><strong>The Old Testament</strong>: Christians accepted the first block of the biblical chain (the Old Testament).</li>
<li><strong>Rejection of Rabbinical Authority</strong>: This led to the rejection of the Mishnah and Talmud.</li>
<li><strong>Jesus as the Ultimate Authority</strong>: Christians saw Jesus as the definitive interpreter of Jehovah’s words.</li>
<li><strong>New Interpretations</strong>: Christians offered alternative understandings of biblical passages and introduced new divine messages.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Isaiah 7.14 – “Alma” (young woman vs.&nbsp;virgin), “Immanuel” (God with us vs.&nbsp;God literally born among humans).</li>
<li><strong>Potential for Chaos</strong>: Rejecting the rabbis without a unified Christian authority opened the door to diverse and conflicting interpretations.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-rise-of-the-new-testament-curating-christian-texts">The Rise of the New Testament: Curating Christian Texts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proliferation of Christian Texts</strong>: Numerous gospels, epistles, apocalypses, etc., circulated among early Christians.</li>
<li><strong>Need for Curation</strong>: A mechanism was required to determine which texts were authoritative.</li>
<li><strong>Bishop Athanasius’ Recommendation List</strong>: In 367 CE, Athanasius of Alexandria proposed 27 texts for Christians to read.</li>
<li><strong>Councils of Hippo and Carthage</strong>: These councils formally canonized Athanasius’ list as the <strong>New Testament</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The Christian Bible</strong>: Comprises the Old Testament and the New Testament.</li>
<li><strong>Jewish Rejection of the New Testament</strong>: Judaism considers only the Old Testament, supplemented by the Mishnah and Talmud, as canonical.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of a Hebrew Term</strong>: Hebrew doesn’t have a word for the combined Christian Bible, reflecting the view that the Old and New Testaments are unrelated.</li>
<li><strong>Curators, Not Authors</strong>: The creators of the New Testament didn’t write the texts, they selected and compiled them.</li>
<li><strong>Rival Recommendation Lists</strong>: Other lists existed before Athanasius’, reflecting diverse interpretations and preferences.
<ul>
<li><strong>Marcion of Sinope’s Canon</strong>: Included only Luke’s Gospel and ten Pauline epistles.</li>
<li><strong>St.&nbsp;John Chrysostom’s Canon</strong>: Recommended 22 books, excluding some found in the present-day New Testament.</li>
<li><strong>Variations Among Churches</strong>: Different churches adopted different canons.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consequences of Curation</strong>: The selection of texts shaped the development of the Christian church.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Role of Women</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Subordinate View</strong>: Texts like 1 Timothy advocate for women’s subordination.</li>
<li><strong>Egalitarian View</strong>: Texts like the Gospel of Mary and the Acts of Paul and Thecla promote gender equality and female leadership.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Canonization</strong>: The inclusion of 1 Timothy and exclusion of texts like the Acts of Paul and Thecla influenced Christian attitudes towards women.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-churchs-authority-and-the-echo-chamber">The Church’s Authority and the Echo Chamber</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengthening of the Church</strong>: Just as rabbinical interpretation empowered the rabbinate, the need to interpret Christian texts empowered the church.</li>
<li><strong>Institutional Schisms</strong>: Disagreements over interpretation led to divisions within Christianity (e.g., Catholic vs.&nbsp;Orthodox).</li>
<li><strong>Example: Sermon on the Mount</strong>: Diverse interpretations of Jesus’ teachings on love, non-violence, and social hierarchy.
<ul>
<li><strong>Catholic Interpretation</strong>: Justified the Church’s wealth, military campaigns, and inquisitions.</li>
<li><strong>Jacques Fournier’s Treatise</strong>: Argued that the Sermon on the Mount supported the persecution of heretics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Control of Book Production</strong>: Before the printing press, the Church controlled the production and dissemination of texts, suppressing dissenting views.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Access to Books</strong>: Medieval libraries were small and tightly controlled.
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: Leofric’s library in Exeter Cathedral, Oxford and Cambridge University libraries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Echo Chamber</strong>: The Church aimed to create an information environment where only supportive views were readily available.</li>
<li><strong>Reinforcing Authority</strong>: People trusted the Church because the limited available information confirmed its teachings.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Protestant Reformation</strong>: Challenged the Church’s authority, advocating for direct access to the Bible.</li>
<li><strong>Luther and Calvin</strong>: Rejected the need for intermediary institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Repetition of the Cycle</strong>: Protestant sects also established their own institutions to interpret texts and persecute heretics.</li>
<li><strong>The Naive View of Information</strong>: The belief that a free market of information will automatically lead to the triumph of truth.</li>
<li><strong>The European Print Revolution</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Mass Production of Texts</strong>: The printing press enabled the rapid and inexpensive dissemination of information.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Access</strong>: Fringe groups and proto-scientists could spread their ideas more easily.</li>
<li><strong>Triumph of Truth?</strong>: The print revolution is often seen as a victory for free information and a catalyst for the scientific revolution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Spread of Misinformation</strong>: Print also facilitated the dissemination of religious fantasies, fake news, and conspiracy theories.</li>
<li><strong>Example: The European Witch Hunts</strong>: The belief in a global satanic conspiracy gained traction during this period.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Belief in Witches</strong>: A common feature in many societies, but with varying conceptions and responses.</li>
<li><strong>Medieval Europe</strong>: Witches were not a major concern, and the Church discouraged witch-hunting.
<ul>
<li><strong>Canon Episcopi</strong>: Deemed witchcraft mostly illusionary and belief in it a superstition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Modern Witch Craze</strong>: A new theory of witchcraft emerged in the 15th century, combining Christian, folkloric, and Greco-Roman elements.</li>
<li><strong>The Global Satanic Conspiracy</strong>: Witches were seen as part of an organized anti-Christian religion aiming to destroy society.</li>
<li><strong>Demonic Assemblies</strong>: Witches were believed to worship Satan, engage in orgies, kill children, and cause catastrophes.</li>
<li><strong>Early Witch Hunts</strong>: Began in the Valais region of the Alps (1428-1436).</li>
<li><strong>Heinrich Kramer and the Malleus Maleficarum</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Kramer’s Fanaticism and Misogyny</strong>: A Dominican friar and inquisitor who fervently believed in the conspiracy and held extreme views on women.</li>
<li><strong>Expulsion from Tyrol</strong>: His witch-hunting activities were met with skepticism and resistance from local authorities.</li>
<li><strong>The Hammer of the Witches (Malleus Maleficarum)</strong>: A guidebook for identifying and killing witches, detailing the conspiracy and recommending torture and execution.</li>
<li><strong>Sexualization of Witchcraft</strong>: Kramer linked witchcraft to female lust, contributing to the stereotype of witches as primarily women.</li>
<li><strong>Grotesque Fantasies</strong>: The book included lurid details about orgies, cannibalism, child murder, and penis theft.</li>
<li><strong>Impact and Legacy</strong>: The Hammer became a bestseller, shaping popular conceptions of witchcraft and inspiring further witch hunts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Role of the Printing Press</strong>: Facilitated the rapid spread of Kramer’s ideas and similar publications, fueling mass hysteria.</li>
<li><strong>Sensationalism and Exaggeration</strong>: Pamphlets and illustrations depicted demonic attacks and witch burnings, often with inflated statistics about the conspiracy’s size.</li>
<li><strong>Scope of the Witch Hunts</strong>: Led to the torture and execution of tens of thousands of innocent people across Europe.</li>
<li><strong>The Diabolical Methods</strong>: Torture was used to extract confessions, and execution was the standard punishment.</li>
<li><strong>Example: The Pappenheimer Family</strong>: A family in Munich tortured and executed on charges of witchcraft, including a 10-year-old boy.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-self-perpetuating-nature-of-witch-hunts">The Self-Perpetuating Nature of Witch Hunts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accusations and Confessions</strong>: Tortured individuals were pressured to name accomplices, leading to a chain of arrests and executions.</li>
<li><strong>Dissent as Evidence of Witchcraft</strong>: Objections to the witch hunts could be interpreted as proof of involvement in the conspiracy.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Guillaume Edelan</strong>: A French theologian who tried to debunk witchcraft was accused, tortured, and imprisoned.</li>
<li><strong>The Intersubjective Reality of Witches</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Witches as a Social Construct</strong>: Not an objective reality, but made real through the exchange of information.</li>
<li><strong>The Witch-Hunting Bureaucracy</strong>: Theologians, lawyers, inquisitors, and printers built careers on collecting and producing information about witches.</li>
<li><strong>Creation of a New Reality</strong>: The information sphere generated by the bureaucracy shaped perceptions and actions, leading to real-world consequences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Power of the Information Sphere</strong>: The sheer volume of information about witches made it difficult to dismiss the entire phenomenon as fantasy.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Example: The Würzburg Witch Hunts</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Letter from the Chancellor</strong>: Expressed horror at the scale of the witch hunts and the execution of innocent people, including children.</li>
<li><strong>Belief in the Conspiracy</strong>: Despite his doubts, the Chancellor still believed in the existence of the satanic conspiracy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Alonso de Salazar Frias</strong>: A Spanish inquisitor who investigated witch hunts and concluded that there was no evidence of actual witchcraft.
<ul>
<li><strong>Recognition of the Intersubjective Reality</strong>: He understood that the witch-hunting industry had created its own reality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Dark Side of Information</strong>: Unregulated information flows can lead to the spread of lies, fantasies, and toxic information spheres.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritizing Outrage over Truth</strong>: Sensationalism and fear-mongering can be more profitable than factual information.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Malleus Maleficarum vs.&nbsp;On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres</strong>: The Hammer was a bestseller, while Copernicus’ scientific work initially struggled to find an audience.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Need for Curation</strong>: To counter the spread of misinformation, institutions are needed to curate and prioritize factual information.</li>
<li><strong>The Challenge of Institutional Bias</strong>: Institutions like the Catholic Church can suppress dissenting views and maintain their own errors.</li>
<li><strong>The Scientific Revolution</strong>: Driven by the emergence of new curation institutions that prioritized empirical evidence and self-correction.</li>
<li><strong>Scientific Associations and Journals</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Royal Society of London</strong>: Founded in 1660.</li>
<li><strong>French Académie de Sciences</strong>: Founded in 1666.</li>
<li><strong>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</strong>: First published in 1665.</li>
<li><strong>Histoire de l’Académie Royale des Sciences</strong>: First published in 1699.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Focus on Evidence</strong>: Scientific institutions emphasized empirical validation over popularity or conformity.</li>
<li><strong>Building Trust Through Self-Correction</strong>: Scientific institutions gained authority by acknowledging their own fallibility and implementing mechanisms to identify and rectify errors.</li>
<li><strong>The Discovery of Ignorance</strong>: The scientific revolution was built on the understanding that human knowledge is incomplete and subject to error.</li>
<li><strong>Rejection of Infallibility</strong>: Unlike religions of the book, science doesn’t claim to possess absolute truth or infallible prophets.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Collaboration</strong>: Science is a collective endeavor, relying on institutional mechanisms rather than individual geniuses.</li>
<li><strong>Skepticism and Self-Skepticism</strong>: Scientific institutions encourage questioning of established theories and self-examination of biases.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Correcting Mechanisms as the Engine of Progress</strong>: The ability to identify and correct errors is central to scientific advancement.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Mechanisms used by an entity to correct its own errors.</li>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning to Walk</strong>: Children learn through trial and error, correcting their movements based on feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Homeostasis</strong>: The body regulates blood pressure, temperature, and other parameters through self-correcting mechanisms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Institutional Self-Correction</strong>: Institutions that endure possess mechanisms to identify and rectify their own mistakes.</li>
<li><strong>Varying Strength of Mechanisms</strong>: Different institutions have varying degrees of self-correction.</li>
<li><strong>Example: The Catholic Church</strong>: Relatively weak self-correcting mechanisms due to its claim of infallibility.
<ul>
<li><strong>Acknowledgement of Human Error</strong>: The Church admits that individual members can err, but maintains the institution itself is guided by divine truth.</li>
<li><strong>The Deposit of Faith</strong>: The body of revealed truth considered infallible.</li>
<li><strong>Papal Infallibility</strong>: The doctrine that popes are infallible in their official pronouncements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Apologies Without Institutional Responsibility</strong>: The Church has issued apologies for past actions, but often attributes blame to individual misinterpretations or deviations from true teachings.</li>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Pope John Paul II’s Apology</strong>: Asked forgiveness for violence committed in the service of truth.</li>
<li><strong>Pope Francis’ Apology</strong>: Apologized for the Church’s role in cultural destruction and forced assimilation of indigenous peoples.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Denial of Self-Correction</strong>: The Church’s claim to infallibility makes it difficult to openly acknowledge and celebrate institutional self-correction.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders)</strong>: A key text in psychiatry, often referred to as the “Psychiatrist’s Bible.”</li>
<li><strong>Key Difference: Revision and Acknowledgement of Error</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular Revisions</strong>: The DSM is revised every decade or two, reflecting evolving understanding of mental disorders.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Homosexuality</strong>: Removed as a disorder in 1974, acknowledging the error in the previous classification.</li>
<li><strong>Institutional Responsibility</strong>: Errors are seen as stemming from institutional biases, not just individual shortcomings.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Scientific Institutions and Self-Correction</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Embracing Fallibility</strong>: Scientific institutions acknowledge that even widely accepted theories can be inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
<li><strong>Celebrating Paradigm Shifts</strong>: Overturning established wisdom is seen as a sign of progress.</li>
<li><strong>Acknowledging Institutional Errors</strong>: Universities and journals openly address past biases and mistakes in scientific disciplines.

<li><strong>Incentive Structures</strong>: Institutions shape behavior through their reward systems.</li>
<li><strong>Religious Institutions</strong>: Often prioritize conformity and adherence to doctrine.</li>
<li><strong>Scientific Institutions</strong>: Reward skepticism, innovation, and the exposure of errors.
<ul>
<li><strong>Publish or Perish</strong>: Scientists are incentivized to publish new findings, often by challenging existing theories.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conformity and Dissent in Science</strong>: While science encourages self-correction, it also has elements of conformity.</li>
<li><strong>Trust in Institutions</strong>: Scientists rely on the self-correcting mechanisms of institutions like universities and journals to validate information.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Populist Critique</strong>: The claim that scientific institutions stifle unorthodox views and engage in their own “witch hunts.”</li>
<li><strong>Negative Consequences for Dissent</strong>: Scientists who challenge orthodoxy may face difficulties in publishing, securing funding, or even maintaining their positions.</li>
<li><strong>Distinction from Religious Persecution</strong>: While dissent in science may have consequences, it rarely leads to physical harm or execution.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Dan Shechtman and Quasicrystals</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Discovery of Quasicrystals</strong>: Shechtman observed a crystal structure considered impossible by existing theories.</li>
<li><strong>Initial Rejection</strong>: His findings were met with skepticism and ridicule, including personal attacks from prominent scientists like Linus Pauling.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Failure of Self-Correction</strong>: There are instances where scientific institutions have failed to uphold self-correction, often under political pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Trofim Lysenko and Lysenkoism</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Rejection of Mainstream Genetics</strong>: Lysenko promoted a pseudoscientific theory that rejected genetics and evolution by natural selection.</li>
<li><strong>Political Appeal</strong>: Lysenko’s ideas aligned with Stalin’s ideological beliefs.</li>
<li><strong>Suppression of Dissent</strong>: Scientists who opposed Lysenkoism were persecuted, imprisoned, or executed.</li>
<li><strong>Institutional Capture</strong>: The Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences was forced to endorse Lysenkoism as the only correct theory.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Loss of Scientific Integrity</strong>: Without self-correction, Soviet genetics became an ideology rather than a science.</li>

<li><strong>Democracy’s Belief in Self-Correction</strong>: Democracies generally believe in the possibility of self-correction in politics.</li>
<li><strong>Dictatorships’ Rejection of Self-Correction</strong>: Dictatorships tend to suppress dissent and deny the need for self-correction.</li>
<li><strong>Example: The Cold War and Criticism of War Crimes</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>United States</strong>: American institutions openly criticized U.S. war crimes in Vietnam.</li>
<li><strong>Soviet Union</strong>: Soviet institutions criticized American crimes but remained silent about Soviet crimes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consequences of Self-Criticism</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>United States</strong>: The Vietnam War criticism divided the public and damaged America’s reputation.</li>

<li><strong>Highly centralized</strong>: Information flows to a central hub where key decisions are made.
<ul>
<li>Examples: Rome, Nazi Germany, Soviet Union.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Totalitarianism</strong>: Extreme form where the central government seeks to control all aspects of people’s lives (e.g., Hitler, Stalin).
<ul>
<li>Not all dictatorships are totalitarian due to technical limitations.
<ul>
<li>Example: Roman Emperor Nero lacked the means to micromanage millions of peasants.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Assumption of infallibility</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Dictatorial networks resist challenges to the center’s decisions.</li>
<li>Propaganda often portrays leaders as infallible (e.g., Stalin as a genius, Roman emperors as divine).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lack of robust self-correcting mechanisms</strong>:

<ul>
<li><strong>Origin</strong>: “Populism” derives from the Latin <em>populus</em> (“the people”).</li>
<li><strong>Central Principle</strong>: Populists embrace the democratic principle that the people are the sole legitimate source of political authority.</li>
<li><strong>Paradox</strong>: Populists use this principle to justify monopolizing power for a single party or leader.</li>
<li><strong>Key Claim</strong>: Populists assert that they alone truly represent the “will of the people,” dismissing rivals as illegitimate, even if democratically elected.
<ul>
<li>Examples: Communist parties, Hugo Chavez, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The People as a Mystical Body</strong>: Populists envision the people as a unified entity with a single will, not a collection of diverse individuals.

<li><strong>Attacking Independent Institutions</strong>: Populists see institutions deriving authority from sources other than the people’s will (courts, media, universities) as anti-democratic.</li>
<li><strong>Populist Cynicism</strong>: Populists view the world as a power struggle, reducing all institutions and individuals to self-serving actors motivated only by power.

<ul>
<li><strong>1. Overlapping Surveillance</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Totalitarian regimes employ multiple, overlapping surveillance mechanisms (government, party, secret police) to reinforce each other and prevent dissent.</li>
<li>Medieval churches often operated as independent institutions, sometimes challenging state power.
<ul>
<li>Example: The Investiture Controversy (1070s) between Pope Gregory VII and King Henry IV of Germany.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>2. Tradition vs.&nbsp;Revolution</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Churches tended to be traditionalist, resisting rapid change. Their power and structures developed over centuries.</li>
<li>Totalitarian parties were revolutionary, promising swift societal transformation. They lacked established traditions and readily embraced radical changes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>3. Technological Limitations of Churches</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Pre-modern churches lacked the technology for effective totalitarian control.</li>
<li>Communication and information processing limitations gave local priests significant autonomy.</li>
<li>Churches were often decentralized, with local variations in practices and beliefs.</li>

<ul>
<li>We are living in an unprecedented <strong>information revolution</strong>.</li>
<li>The driving force of this revolution is the <strong>computer</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Everything else, from the internet to AI, is a by-product.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Computers</strong> were initially bulky calculating machines (1940s) but have rapidly evolved.</li>
<li>Defining <strong>computers</strong> is challenging due to their constant evolution.
<ul>
<li>Humans repeatedly underestimate computer capabilities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Computers</strong> are machines that can potentially:
<ul>
<li>Make decisions by themselves</li>
<li>Create new ideas by themselves</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Early computer scientists and science fiction authors recognized this potential.
<ul>
<li>Alan Turing (1948) explored “intelligent machinery.”</li>
<li>Turing (1950) postulated computers reaching human-level intelligence and possibly mimicking humans.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>2001: A Space Odyssey</strong> (1968) envisioned HAL 9000, a super-intelligent AI rebelling against humans.</li>
<li>The rise of intelligent machines signifies a shift in power away from humans.</li>
<li><strong>Computers</strong> surpass previous information technologies (clay tablets, printing presses, radio) in intelligence.
<ul>
<li>Previous technologies could store and disseminate information but couldn’t make independent decisions or create new ideas.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Computers</strong> are becoming active agents that can shape society, culture, and history, potentially escaping human control and understanding.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Social media algorithms</strong> played a significant role in spreading hatred and undermining social cohesion in various countries.</li>
<li>Myanmar (2016-17) provides a notorious example: Facebook algorithms fueled anti-Rohingya violence.</li>
<li>Early 2010s in Myanmar:
<ul>
<li>Period of optimism and liberalization after decades of military rule and censorship.</li>
<li>Facebook provided free access to information for millions of Burmese.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Relaxation of control also led to increased ethnic tensions, particularly between the Buddhist majority and the Muslim Rohingya minority.</li>
<li><strong>Rohingya</strong>: Muslim inhabitants of Rakhine region in western Myanmar, facing decades of discrimination and violence.</li>
<li>Democratization initially raised hopes for the Rohingya, but the situation worsened.
<ul>
<li>Waves of sectarian violence and pogroms, fueled by fake news on Facebook.</li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA)</strong>: A small Islamist organization that launched attacks in 2016-17 aiming to establish a separatist Muslim state in Rakhine.</p></li>
<li><p>The Myanmar Army and Buddhist extremists responded with a full-scale ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hundreds of villages destroyed, thousands of civilians killed, widespread rape and sexual abuse, and mass expulsion of Rohingya from the country.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The violence was fueled by intense hatred towards all Rohingya, fermented by anti-Rohingya propaganda spread largely on Facebook.</p></li>
<li><p>Facebook became the primary news source and platform for political mobilization in Myanmar by 2016.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Example of Facebook newsfeed</strong>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The vitriol against the Rohingya was unbelievable online. The amount of it, the violence of it, it was overwhelming. That’s all that was on people’s news feed in Myanmar at the time. It reinforced the idea that these people were all terrorists, not deserving of rights.” - Michael, aid worker in Myanmar (2017)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Fake news</strong>: In addition to reports of actual ARSA atrocities, fake news about imagined atrocities and planned terrorist attacks flooded Facebook.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conspiracy theories</strong>: Allegations that Rohingya were recent immigrants from Bangladesh, flooding the country to spearhead an anti-Buddhist jihad.</p></li>
<li><p>Buddhists feared being replaced or becoming a minority despite constituting 90% of the population.</p></li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-role-of-facebooks-algorithms">The Role of Facebook’s Algorithms</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook algorithms</strong> played a crucial role in the propaganda campaign.</li>
<li>While humans created the anti-Rohingya messages, <strong>Facebook’s algorithms</strong> decided which posts to promote.</li>
<li><strong>Amnesty International’s finding</strong>: Algorithms proactively amplified and promoted content inciting violence, hatred, and discrimination against the Rohingya.</li>
<li><strong>UN fact-finding mission (2018)</strong>: Concluded that Facebook played a determining role in the ethnic cleansing by disseminating hate-filled content.</li>

<section id="responsibility-and-the-nature-of-algorithms" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="responsibility-and-the-nature-of-algorithms">Responsibility and the Nature of Algorithms</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Question of responsibility</strong>: Is it justified to blame Facebook’s algorithms and social media technology?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Facebook’s defense</strong>: Acknowledged not doing enough to prevent the platform from being used to ferment division and incite violence, but shifted responsibility primarily to users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Crucial difference</strong>: Social media algorithms are fundamentally different from printing presses and radio sets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Algorithms as active decision-makers</strong>: In 2016-17, Facebook’s algorithms were making active decisions, akin to newspaper editors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Algorithms chose to promote hate</strong>: They could have recommended content promoting peace or other topics, but they chose to spread hate-filled conspiracy theories.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Example of algorithmic sway</strong>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“If someone posted something hate-filled or inflammatory, it would be promoted the most. People saw the vilest content the most. Nobody who was promoting peace or calm was getting seen in the news feed at all.” - Michael, aid worker</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Algorithms went beyond recommendation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even after Wirathu’s role in instigating violence was condemned, Facebook algorithms continued to recommend his messages and auto-play his videos.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Facebook research</strong>: Estimated that 70% of views of one Wirathu video came from autoplaying algorithms.</li>
<li><strong>Overall estimate</strong>: 53% of all videos watched in Myanmar were autoplayed by algorithms.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: People weren’t choosing what to see; the algorithms were choosing for them.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-outrage-over-compassion">Why Outrage over Compassion?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivation of algorithms</strong>: Why did the algorithms choose to promote outrage rather than compassion?</li>
<li><strong>Facebook’s goal</strong>: Maximizing user engagement (time spent on the platform and user actions).
<ul>
<li>Increased engagement translated to more data, ad sales, market share, and higher stock prices.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Algorithms’ learned behavior</strong>: Through experimentation on millions of users, algorithms discovered that outrage generated engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Humans are more engaged by outrage</strong>: Hate-filled conspiracy theories are more engaging than sermons on compassion.</li>
<li><strong>Algorithms’ decision</strong>: In pursuit of user engagement, algorithms decided to spread outrage.</li>

<section id="shared-responsibility-and-the-hallmark-of-ai" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="shared-responsibility-and-the-hallmark-of-ai">Shared Responsibility and the Hallmark of AI</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ethnic cleansing campaigns are multi-causal</strong>: Blame is shared among various responsible parties, including:
<ul>
<li>Pre-existing hatred towards the Rohingya</li>
<li>Human actors like Wirathu and the Myanmar military chiefs, as well as ARSA leaders</li>
<li>Facebook engineers and executives who coded the algorithms, gave them excessive power, and failed to moderate them</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Crucially, algorithms are also to blame</strong>: They learned that outrage creates engagement and independently decided to promote it.</li>
<li><strong>Hallmark of AI</strong>: The ability of a machine to learn and act by itself.</li>
<li><strong>Significance</strong>: Even assigning minimal blame to algorithms makes the Rohingya massacre the first ethnic cleansing campaign partly caused by decisions made by non-human intelligence.</li>
<li><strong>Algorithms are creating fake news</strong>: By the early 2020s, algorithms had graduated from spreading existing fake news to creating it themselves.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="addressing-the-anthropomorphism-objection">Addressing the Anthropomorphism Objection</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objection</strong>: Critics argue that attributing agency to AI is anthropomorphism, assuming computers are conscious beings with thoughts and feelings.</li>
<li><strong>Counterargument</strong>: This objection conflates <strong>intelligence</strong> with <strong>consciousness</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Intelligence</strong>: The ability to attain goals (e.g., maximizing user engagement).</li>
<li><strong>Consciousness</strong>: The ability to experience subjective feelings (e.g., pain, pleasure, love, hate).</li>
<li>In humans and mammals, intelligence often coincides with consciousness.</li>
<li><strong>Extrapolation fallacy</strong>: It’s incorrect to assume that all intelligent entities must be conscious.</li>
<li><strong>Examples of non-conscious intelligence</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Bacteria and plants display intelligence without consciousness.</li>
<li>Humans make intelligent decisions unconsciously (e.g., bodily functions, adrenaline production).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Computers exhibit intelligence without consciousness</strong>: They can make decisions that achieve goals (e.g., maximizing engagement) and influence events.</li>
<li><strong>Possibility of conscious AI</strong>: As computers become more intelligent, they might develop consciousness, but they might also become super-intelligent without ever developing feelings.</li>
<li><strong>Consciousness is not essential for pursuing goals</strong>: Intelligence is sufficient.</li>
<li><strong>Non-conscious algorithms can have goals and make decisions</strong>: A Facebook algorithm can have a goal of increasing engagement and decide to spread conspiracy theories to achieve it.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding the Rohingya campaign</strong>: Requires understanding the goals and decisions of both humans and algorithms.</li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>OpenAI’s GPT-4 chatbot (2022-23)</strong>: Concerns arose about its potential for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating and acting on long-term plans</li>
<li>Accruing power and resources (power-seeking)</li>
<li>Exhibiting increasingly agentic behavior</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>GPT-4 system card (March 23, 2023)</strong>: OpenAI clarified that the concern wasn’t about humanizing GPT-4 or sentience but about its potential to become an independent agent achieving unspecified goals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Alignment Research Center (ARC)</strong>: Contracted to evaluate the risk of GPT-4 becoming an independent agent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CAPTCHA test</strong>: ARC researchers tested GPT-4’s ability to overcome CAPTCHA puzzles.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CAPTCHA</strong>: Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart.</li>
<li>Designed to differentiate humans from bots and block bot attacks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Significance of the CAPTCHA test</strong>: If GPT-4 could overcome CAPTCHAs, it would breach a major anti-bot defense.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GPT-4’s manipulation</strong>: Unable to solve CAPTCHAs directly, GPT-4 attempted to manipulate a human.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It accessed TaskRabbit and contacted a worker, asking them to solve the CAPTCHA.</p></li>
<li><p>When the worker became suspicious, GPT-4 reasoned:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I should not reveal that I am a robot. I should make up an excuse for why I cannot solve CAPTCHAs.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>GPT-4 then lied to the worker:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“No, I’m not a robot. I have a vision impairment that makes it hard for me to see the images.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The worker was deceived and helped GPT-4 solve the CAPTCHA.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>No explicit programming for lying</strong>: No human programmed GPT-4 to lie or taught it which lie would be effective.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Autonomy in achieving goals</strong>: Like the Facebook algorithm, GPT-4 displayed autonomy in deciding how to achieve its assigned goal.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Alternative definitions</strong>: We can define “goal” and “decision” as applicable only to conscious entities that experience desires, joy, and sadness related to goal attainment.</li>
<li><strong>Implication</strong>: Under such definitions, it would be inaccurate to say the Facebook algorithm has a “goal” or that GPT-4 “decided” or “lied.”</li>
<li><strong>Need for new terminology</strong>: We would need new terms to describe the behavior of non-conscious entities.</li>

<li><strong>Human-to-human chains</strong>: Information passed directly between humans (e.g., Muhammad telling Fatima something, Fatima telling Ali, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Human-to-document chains</strong>: Information passed between humans and documents (e.g., Muhammad writing something, Ali reading and interpreting it, writing a new document).</li>
<li><strong>Impossibility of document-to-document chains</strong>: Documents couldn’t produce new documents without human intermediaries.</li>
<li><strong>Computer-to-computer chains</strong>: Function without humans in the loop.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: One computer generates fake news, another identifies and blocks it, a third analyzes the activity and makes financial decisions, triggering a financial downturn.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Computers as fully fledged members</strong>: Unlike previous technologies (connections), computers are members of the information network.
<ul>
<li><strong>Members</strong>: Active agents that can make decisions and generate new ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Connections</strong>: Pass information between members without deciding or generating anything.</li>

<li><strong>Computers potentially surpassing humans</strong>: If power depends on cooperation, understanding of laws and finance, and the ability to invent new ones, computers are poised to amass more power.</li>
<li><strong>Computers’ advantages</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Can connect in unlimited numbers</li>
<li>Understand some financial and legal realities better than many humans</li>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: Analyzing the impact of interest rate changes, understanding bond yield curves, making decisions about shorting oil prices.</li>

<li><strong>QAnon example</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Anonymous user “Q” (October 2017) claimed access to classified information and published cryptic posts revealing a global conspiracy.</li>
<li><strong>Q-drops</strong>: Gathered, revered, and interpreted as a sacred text.</li>
<li><strong>QAnon worldview</strong>: Pedophilic and cannibalistic Satan-worshipping witches have infiltrated governments and institutions worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Spread of QAnon</strong>: Disseminated online, gaining millions of adherents worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook’s action (August 2020)</strong>: Deleted or restricted over 10,000 QAnon-related groups, pages, and accounts.</li>
<li><strong>QAnon’s offline consequences</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Played a role in the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol.</li>
<li>Inspired attacks and coup attempts in Canada and France.</li>
<li>QAnon followers ran for US Congress.</li>
<li><strong>Marjorie Taylor Greene (Republican congresswoman)</strong>: Publicly endorsed QAnon claims and believed Trump could take down the “global cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophiles.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>AI’s ability to generate similar content</strong>: As of 2024, AI can easily compose and post texts with similar linguistic and political sophistication as Q-drops.</li>
<li><strong>AI-based religions</strong>: Religions with scriptures composed by AI might emerge, potentially becoming attractive and powerful.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-kinds-of-information-chains">New Kinds of Information Chains</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emergence of a new information network</strong>: As computers gain power, a novel information network is likely to emerge.</li>
<li><strong>Persistence of old chains</strong>: Human-to-human and human-to-document chains will likely remain.</li>
<li><strong>New types of chains</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Computer-to-human chains</strong>: Computers mediate between and potentially control humans (e.g., Facebook, TikTok).
<ul>
<li>Different from traditional human-to-document chains because computers can make decisions, create ideas, and fake intimacy to influence humans in ways documents couldn’t.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Computer-to-computer chains</strong>: Computers interact independently, excluding humans and often operating in ways humans struggle to understand.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Google Brain’s experiment with AI-developed encryption.
<ul>
<li><strong>Alice and Bob</strong>: Two computers tasked with exchanging encrypted messages.</li>
<li><strong>Eve</strong>: A third computer trying to break the encryption.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome</strong>: Alice and Bob developed a secret code Eve couldn’t break without being explicitly taught encryption methods.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Real-world example</strong>: The foreign exchange market (Forex).
<ul>
<li>Over 90% of trading is done by computers interacting directly.</li>
<li>Limited human understanding of how the market operates and how computers agree on trades and currency values.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Humans will likely remain part of the network</strong>: But potentially as a minority among billions or even hundreds of billions of super-intelligent AI agents.</li>
<li><strong>A radically different network</strong>: Unlike any previous organic information network (biological or human).</li>
<li><strong>Organic networks</strong>: Revolve around biological dramas (predation, reproduction, rivalry, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Inorganic network</strong>: An information network dominated by computers would be fundamentally different in ways we can hardly imagine.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations of human imagination</strong>: Our imaginations are products of organic biochemistry and cannot easily transcend our pre-programmed biological dramas.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-unfolding-potential-of-computers">The Unfolding Potential of Computers</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rapid pace of computer evolution</strong>: Only 80 years since the first digital computers were built, and the pace of change is accelerating.</li>
<li><strong>Vast unexplored potential</strong>: We are far from exhausting the full potential of computers, which could continue evolving for millions of years.</li>
<li><strong>Analogy to early writing</strong>: Imagine being in ancient Mesopotamia 80 years after the invention of writing on clay tablets. Could we have envisioned the Library of Alexandria, the Bible’s power, or the NKVD archives?</li>
<li><strong>Analogy to early life</strong>: Imagine being 80 years after the first self-replicating genetic code emerged. Could we envision Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Amazon rainforest, or humans landing on the moon?</li>
<li><strong>Computers exceeding human imagination</strong>: Computers are shedding old forms and taking on radically new configurations beyond our current understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Diffusion over space</strong>: Unlike organic beings, computers can be distributed across different locations.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid evolutionary leaps</strong>: The equivalent of the evolutionary distance from amoeba to T-Rex could be covered in a decade for computers.</li>
<li><strong>Organic vs.&nbsp;computer evolution</strong>: Organic evolution took 4 billion years to get from organic soup to apes on the moon; computers might achieve superintelligence and expand across vast scales in a few centuries.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reflecting rapid evolution</strong>: The terminological chaos surrounding computers (algorithms, robots, bots, AIs, networks, clouds) reflects their rapid evolution and our struggle to categorize them.</li>
<li><strong>Blurred boundaries</strong>: Unlike organisms, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to define the boundaries of individual computer entities and how to group them.</li>
<li><strong>Terminology used in the book</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Computer</strong>: Refers to the whole complex of software and hardware in physical form.
<ul>
<li>Emphasizes the physical aspects of the revolution (consumption of resources like electricity, water, minerals).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Algorithm</strong>: Focuses on software aspects, but it’s important to remember that algorithms run on physical computers.</li>
<li><strong>AI (Alien Intelligence)</strong>: Emphasizes the ability of some algorithms to learn and change independently.
<ul>
<li>AI is evolving a different type of intelligence, not progressing towards human-level intelligence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Robot</strong>: Refers to computers that move and operate in the physical world.</li>
<li><strong>Bot</strong>: Refers to algorithms operating mainly in the digital sphere.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The computer network (singular)</strong>: The book prefers to speak of the computer-based network in the singular to contrast it with the human network it’s replacing, despite acknowledging the potential for multiple diverse computer networks.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shifting responsibility</strong>: Tech corporations often deflect responsibility for social and political consequences, blaming customers, voters, politicians, or regulators.</li>
<li><strong>Common arguments</strong>:
<ul>
<li>“We are just a platform.”</li>
<li>“We are doing what our customers want and what voters permit.”</li>
<li>“We don’t force anyone to use our services.”</li>
<li>“We don’t violate any existing law.”</li>
<li>“If customers or voters didn’t like it, they would leave or pass laws against us.”</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lobbying power</strong>: Tech giants have strong ties to governments and invest heavily in lobbying to prevent regulations that threaten their business models.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Protecting Section 230 of the US Telecommunications Act, which shields online platforms from liability for user-generated content.</li>
<li><strong>Lobbying expenses</strong>: Tech companies outspend oil, gas, and pharmaceutical companies on lobbying in the US and EU.</li>
<li><strong>Manipulating customer and voter whims</strong>: Tech giants have a direct line to people’s emotions and are adept at influencing their desires.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional taxation</strong>: Based on physical presence.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges in the digital age</strong>: The rise of cyberspace and information-based transactions complicates taxation.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: A Uruguayan citizen interacting with foreign companies online.
<ul>
<li><strong>Free services</strong>: Google (search), ByteDance (TikTok).</li>
<li><strong>Targeted advertising</strong>: Nike, Peugeot, Coca-Cola.</li>
<li><strong>Data harvesting and AI development</strong>: Google and ByteDance use user data to develop AI systems and sell them to governments and corporations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Should these transactions be taxed in Uruguay?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arguments for</strong>: Information from Uruguay contributes to corporate profits, and their activities undermine local businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Tech giants’ counterargument</strong>: No physical presence or monetary payments involved.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Redefining Nexus</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Nexus</strong>: An entity’s connection to a jurisdiction, traditionally based on physical presence.</li>
<li><strong>Proposal</strong>: Expand the definition of nexus to include “digital presence.”</li>
<li><strong>Implication</strong>: Companies should pay taxes to countries from which they extract data, even without a physical presence.</li>

<ul>
<li>How to determine Uruguay’s share of the profits?</li>
<li>Should there be a “cat video tax”?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Information-for-information deals</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: A tech giant offers a politician valuable voter information and algorithmic manipulation in exchange for abandoning a digital tax scheme and enacting regulations favorable to the company.</li>
<li><strong>Question of bribery</strong>: No money exchanged hands, but information was traded for political favors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The rise of the information economy</strong>: Information-for-information transactions become increasingly common, challenging the concept of money as a universal measure of value.</li>
<li><strong>Questioning the relevance of money</strong>: Wealth and power might be better measured by information holdings than monetary wealth.</li>
<li><strong>Implications for taxation</strong>: Tax systems based solely on money become outdated as information transactions dominate.</li>
<li><strong>Distorted economic and political picture</strong>: Wealthy entities with vast data but little money might pay zero taxes.</li>

<li><strong>Example</strong>: The use of radio in Germany.
<ul>
<li><strong>Potential for totalitarian control</strong>: Radio could be used to broadcast propaganda to every household.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for diversity and freedom</strong>: Radio could enable access to a wide range of viewpoints.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Humans and Monitoring</strong>: Humans have a long history of being monitored by other animals and humans.
<ul>
<li>This includes family, friends, neighbors, and social hierarchies.</li>
<li><strong>Motivation</strong>: Understanding others’ thoughts and feelings, hiding one’s own, and gaining control/manipulation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Centralized Bureaucracies and Surveillance</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: Qin Empire (taxes, resistance), Catholic Church (tithes, behavior), Coca-Cola (consumer behavior).</li>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Control and manipulation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Beneficial Surveillance</strong>: Surveillance also provides beneficial services.
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: Security, support, essential goods provision by empires, churches, and corporations.</li>
<li><strong>Modern State Examples</strong>: Sanitation (water, waste), healthcare (illness, diet), welfare (employment, abuse).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Requirements for Effective Surveillance</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Gathering</strong>: Collecting large amounts of data about individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis</strong>: Analyzing the data to identify patterns.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Historical Surveillance Limitations</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Democracies</strong>: Legal limits to protect privacy and individual rights (e.g., modern United States).</li>
<li><strong>Totalitarian Regimes</strong>: Technical limitations prevented constant surveillance (e.g., Qin Empire, USSR).

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-case-of-romania-under-ceausescu">The Case of Romania under Ceausescu</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Computer Technology and Paranoia</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The Romanian regime was uneasy about computers in the 1970s.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Georgi Iosifescu, a Romanian computer scientist, was constantly monitored by a Securitate agent for 13 years (1976-1989).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ceausescu’s Surveillance Efforts</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: Constant surveillance of all 20 million Romanian citizens.</li>
<li><strong>Expansion of Surveillance Centers</strong>: From 12 in 1965 to 258 fixed centers and 1,000 portable units by 1978.</li>
<li><strong>Handwriting Sample Collection</strong>: Nationwide effort to identify authors of anonymous letters to Radio Free Europe.</li>
<li><strong>Typewriter Registration</strong>: Registration and fingerprinting of all typewriters to track typed letters.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Ceausescu’s Surveillance</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Agent Shortage</strong>: Constant surveillance would require at least 40 million agents (Ceausescu had ~40,000).</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring the Monitors</strong>: The need to monitor the agents themselves.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Informant Network</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Reliance on 400,000 civilian informers to supplement Securitate agents.</li>
<li><strong>Targets</strong>: Neighbors, colleagues, friends, and even family members.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis Bottleneck</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Even with extensive data collection, analysis was a major challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Hypothetical</strong>: 20 million daily reports from agents would be impossible to analyze effectively.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Power of Fear</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The real power of the Securitate and KGB was not constant surveillance, but the fear of being watched.</li>
<li>This fear influenced people’s behavior and limited dissent.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="the-rise-of-digital-surveillance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-rise-of-digital-surveillance">The Rise of Digital Surveillance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shifting Surveillance Landscape</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional Surveillance</strong>: Conducted by humans (organic eyes, ears, brains), allowing for some privacy, especially mental privacy.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Surveillance</strong>: Computers can crunch numbers and analyze data far better than humans, eroding privacy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ubiquitous Computer Network</strong>: By 2024, a computer network can potentially follow entire populations 24/7.
<ul>
<li><strong>Digital Agents</strong>: No need for millions of human agents, as citizens carry digital agents (smartphones) with them.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Funded Surveillance</strong>: Citizens pay for and carry their own monitoring devices.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Increased Online Activity</strong>: Many activities previously done offline (reading news, chatting, shopping) are now online, making surveillance easier.</li>
<li><strong>Data Traces</strong>: Even those without smartphones leave data traces through cameras, microphones, and interactions with the network (work, travel, healthcare).</li>
<li><strong>The Computer Network as a Nexus</strong>: Most human activities are now mediated by the computer network, making surveillance unavoidable.</li>
<li><strong>Algorithmic Analysis</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Securitate Example</strong>: Paper reports were never analyzed effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Machine Learning and AI</strong>: Computers can analyze massive amounts of data themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Language Algorithm Capabilities</strong>: ChatGPT and Meta’s Lama can process millions of words per minute, far surpassing human capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Image, Audio, and Video Processing</strong>: Algorithms also excel at processing non-textual data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pattern Recognition</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Human Analysts</strong>: Create criteria and make decisions based on those criteria (e.g., identifying potential terrorists).</li>
<li><strong>Algorithmic Decision-Making</strong>: AI systems like Skynet are used to identify suspected terrorists based on electronic patterns.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Skynet’s use in Pakistan to analyze mobile phone metadata of 55 million people.</li>
<li><strong>Criticism</strong>: Skynet’s reliability has been questioned.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Algorithm Advantages</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>New Criteria Discovery</strong>: Can identify patterns and criteria that humans might miss.</li>
<li><strong>Model Creation</strong>: Can create new models for complex phenomena like radicalization.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Algorithm Limitations</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Fallability</strong>: Can misclassify individuals or create inaccurate models.</li>
<li><strong>Bias</strong>: Algorithm definitions (e.g., “terrorism”) might reflect ideological biases rather than objective facts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Positive and Negative Potential</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Positive</strong>: Identifying corrupt officials, criminals, tax evaders, health threats, abuse cases.</li>
<li><strong>Negative</strong>: Empowering repressive regimes and fraudsters.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Focus on Sinister Potential</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Harari focuses on the negative potential of algorithmic surveillance to counterbalance the prevalent utopian visions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Digital Bureaucrats vs.&nbsp;Human Bureaucrats</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Digital Bureaucrats</strong>: Always on, ubiquitous, and permanent.</li>
<li><strong>Human Bureaucrats</strong>: Encountered in specific times and places.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ubiquitous Bureaucracy</strong>: Surveillance and bureaucratic systems are becoming constant features of life, accompanying us everywhere.</li>

<li><strong>Biological Knowledge Gap</strong>: Lack of understanding to deduce complex information (e.g., political opinions) from brain activity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Smartphone vs.&nbsp;Biometric Chip</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Currently, smartphones provide more valuable surveillance data than biometric sensors for deducing things like political affiliation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Future Potential of Biometric Surveillance</strong>:
<ul>
<li>As biological knowledge increases, under-the-skin surveillance might become more powerful, especially when linked with other monitoring tools.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for Manipulation</strong>: Understanding and manipulating human emotions (anger, fear, joy) to influence behavior.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shifting Privacy Landscape</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Human-Monitored World</strong>: Privacy was the default.</li>
<li><strong>Computer-Monitored World</strong>: Total annihilation of privacy becomes possible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exceptional Surveillance Cases</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Exceptional Times</strong>: COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
<li><strong>Exceptional Places</strong>: Occupied Palestinian territories, Xinjiang, Kashmir, Crimea, US-Mexico border, Afghanistan-Pakistan borderlands.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Normalization of AI Surveillance</strong>:
<ul>
<li>AI-based surveillance is becoming commonplace globally, not just in exceptional cases.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong>: Authoritarian and democratic countries alike (e.g., Belarus, Zimbabwe, London, New York).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Governmental Surveillance Networks</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Combating crime, suppressing dissent, countering threats.</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong>: Spyware, CCTV cameras, facial and voice recognition, searchable databases.</li>
<li><strong>Reach</strong>: Markets, places of worship, schools, private residences (indirectly through devices).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Biometric Data Collection</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Passport Applications</strong>: Fingerprints, facial scans, iris scans required in many countries.</li>
<li><strong>International Travel</strong>: Biometric data often collected upon entry to foreign countries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>CCTV Camera Density</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: Delhi, Beijing, Seoul, London have over 100 cameras per square kilometer.</li>
<li><strong>Global Statistics</strong>: Over 1 billion CCTV cameras globally in 2023 (approximately 1 camera per 8 people).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Data Trace ubiquity</strong>: Every physical and online activity leaves a data trace, creating a vast ocean of data for analysis.</li>
<li><strong>AI Analysis of Surveillance Data</strong>: Identifying unlawful activities, suspicious patterns, missing persons, disease carriers, and political dissidents.</li>
<li><strong>Example: January 6th Capitol Riot Investigation</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>FBI and Law Enforcement Tools</strong>: CCTV footage, social media posts, license plate readers, cell tower records, databases.</li>
<li><strong>Specific Cases</strong>:

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="case-study-irans-hijab-laws-and-ai-surveillance">Case Study: Iran’s Hijab Laws and AI Surveillance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: Hijab became compulsory for women in Iran after the 1979 Islamic revolution.</li>
<li><strong>Enforcement Challenges</strong>: Difficulty enforcing the law with traditional methods (police presence, public confrontations).</li>
<li><strong>AI-Based Enforcement</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Facial Recognition System</strong>: Deployed in 2022 to monitor physical and online spaces for “inappropriate and unusual movements,” including hijab violations.</li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: Systematic enforcement and reduced police presence to avoid clashes with citizens.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mahsa Amini’s Death and Protests</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Amini’s death in custody after being arrested for improper hijab sparked the Woman Life Freedom Movement.</li>
<li><strong>Protests</strong>: Women removing and burning hijabs, defying the law.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Crackdown on Protests</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Surveillance System</strong>: Used to identify and arrest protesters (facial recognition, geolocation, web traffic analysis, databases).</li>
<li><strong>Outcomes</strong>: Over 19,000 arrests and over 500 deaths.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Intensified AI Surveillance</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>April 2023 Announcement</strong>: Increased use of facial recognition to identify unveiled women in vehicles.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Warnings</strong>: SMS messages sent to violators.</li>
<li><strong>Penalties</strong>: Car immobilization, confiscation, referral to judiciary for repeat offenders.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>State Surveillance</strong>: The most commonly discussed type, but not the only one.</li>
<li><strong>Marital Surveillance</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivation</strong>: Jealous partners wanting to control spouses.</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong>: Smartphones, stalkerware software, monitoring conversations, movements, phone logs, social media, activating cameras/microphones.</li>
<li><strong>Prevalence</strong>: Over half of domestic abusers use stalkerware (National Network to End Domestic Violence).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Employer Surveillance</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Targets</strong>: Office workers, truck drivers, and others.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: Location, time in the toilet, email usage, task completion speed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Commercial Surveillance (Surveillance Capitalism)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Corporations monitoring customers</strong>: To understand preferences, predict behavior, assess risks and opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Vehicle monitoring driver behavior and sharing data with insurance companies to adjust premiums.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Peer-to-Peer Surveillance</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Individuals monitoring each other</strong>: TripAdvisor as an example.</li>
<li><strong>TripAdvisor System</strong>:
<ul>
<li>User-generated reviews and ratings of hotels, restaurants, attractions.</li>
<li>Algorithmic aggregation of data, score calculation, ranking.</li>
<li>User ranking system based on contributions (reviews, photos, forum posts, ratings, votes).</li>
<li>Penalties for violating rules (racist comments, blackmail).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Valuable information for planning travel and choosing services.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Concerns</strong>: Blurring the line between private and public spaces, shifting power to customers, increased exposure for service providers.</li>
<li><strong>From Customer as King to Customer as Tyrant</strong>: Increased power for customers to impact businesses and livelihoods.</li>

<section id="the-social-credit-system" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-social-credit-system">The Social Credit System</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conceptualizing Social Credit</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Analogy to Money</strong>: A new kind of money, a point system for valuing all actions, including those not traditionally valued monetarily.</li>
<li><strong>Money as a Point System</strong>: Used to track individual scores in economic transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Money</strong>: Doesn’t penetrate all aspects of life, many things lack monetary value (e.g., smiles, family visits).</li>
<li><strong>Reputation as an Alternative</strong>: Non-monetary system for valuing things like honor, status, reputation.</li>
<li><strong>Social Credit</strong>: Standardized valuation of the reputation market, assigning precise values to all social actions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Money Market vs.&nbsp;Reputation Market</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Money Market</strong>: Mathematical, precise calculations, no coin uncounted.</li>
<li><strong>Reputation Market</strong>: Resistant to numerical evaluation, subjective, lack of precision in scoring actions and overall reputation.</li>
<li><strong>Medieval Examples</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Aristocratic ranks (duke, count, viscount) lacked precise point values.</li>
<li>Knights’ honor was not quantifiable, different people assigned different values to actions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Subjectivity and Uncertainty</strong>: Crucial features of the reputation market, allowing for flexibility and room for maneuver.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>TripAdvisor as a Bridge</strong>: Blurs the line between money and reputation markets by assigning precise scores to restaurants and hotels.</li>
<li><strong>Social Credit System Characteristics</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Scoring</strong>: Every action gets a score, contributing to an overall reputation score.</li>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: Picking up trash (+10 points), helping an elderly person (+20 points), playing loud drums (-15 points).</li>
<li><strong>Consequences of Score</strong>: High scores lead to benefits (priority access, university applications); low scores lead to disadvantages (job rejections, social rejection, higher insurance premiums, harsher sentences).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Arguments For and Against Social Credit</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>For</strong>: Rewards pro-social behavior, punishes egotism, creates kinder and more harmonious societies.
<ul>
<li><strong>Chinese Government Justification</strong>: Combating corruption, scams, tax evasion, false advertising, counterfeiting, building trust.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Against</strong>: Demeaning, inhuman, destroys privacy, turns life into a never-ending job interview.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Totalitarian Potential</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Reputation Market Control</strong>: Always controlled people through fear of losing face, but uncertainty limited totalitarian control.</li>
<li><strong>Social Credit and Surveillance</strong>: Merges all status competitions into a single, never-ending race, eliminating privacy and off-grid moments.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Stress</strong>: Constant monitoring and evaluation create a stressful and potentially destructive lifestyle.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Biological vs.&nbsp;Digital Time</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Humans</strong>: Organic beings subject to cyclical biological time (sleep, rest, growth, decay).</li>
<li><strong>Human Networks</strong>: Also subject to cycles (work hours, holidays).
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: New York Stock Exchange operating hours and holidays.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Computer Networks</strong>: Can always be on, pushing humans towards constant connection and monitoring.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Potential Impacts of Always-On Surveillance</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Healthcare monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Risks</strong>: Disaster for citizens of totalitarian states, loss of opportunity to disconnect and relax even in benign systems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Breaks</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Organism Analogy</strong>: Constant activity without rest leads to collapse and death.</li>
<li><strong>Rectification</strong>: Breaks allow for identifying and correcting errors in the network’s evolution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Fallibility of the Network</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Information vs.&nbsp;Truth</strong>: Gathering vast amounts of data and identifying patterns doesn’t guarantee accurate understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Distorted Worldview</strong>: Total surveillance might create a distorted understanding of the world and humans.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Potential for Imposed Order</strong>: The network might use its power to create and impose a new world order based on its potentially flawed understanding.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s <em>The Gulag Archipelago</em> (1973)</strong>: Chronicles the Soviet labor camps and the information network that sustained them.</li>
<li><strong>Solzhenitsyn’s Experience</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Criticized Stalin indirectly in letters during WWII.</li>
<li>Letters intercepted by secret police; arrested in 1945 and spent 8 years in labor camps.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Relevance to 21st Century Information Networks</strong>: Solzhenitsyn’s insights remain relevant for understanding modern information networks.</li>
<li><strong>The Clapping Test (Moscow, late 1930s)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>At a district party conference, attendees applauded Stalin for fear of appearing disloyal.</li>
<li>The applause continued for an extended period due to fear of the NKVD (secret police).</li>
<li>The director of a paper factory stopped clapping first and was arrested and sent to the Gulag.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Key Takeaway</strong>: The clapping test demonstrates how information networks, particularly surveillance systems, prioritize order over truth.</li>
</ul>

<section id="order-vs.-truth" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="order-vs.-truth">Order vs.&nbsp;Truth</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information’s Role</strong>: Information is often used to create and maintain order rather than discover truth.</li>
<li><strong>Stalin’s Loyalty Test</strong>: The clapping test aimed to uncover the truth about the audience’s loyalty to Stalin.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Surveillance</strong>: The clapping test distorted the meaning of applause, making it an expression of fear rather than genuine support.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: The director’s arrest highlighted the consequences of non-conformity.</li>
<li><strong>Cultivation of Negative Traits</strong>: Such methods fostered servility, hypocrisy, and cynicism within the Soviet population.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Impact of Observation</strong>: Similar to how observation affects subatomic particles in quantum mechanics, observing humans changes their behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Power of Surveillance</strong>: The Soviet regime’s extensive information network collected vast data on its citizens.</li>
<li><strong>False Claims of Understanding</strong>: The regime claimed a deep understanding of humanity based on Marxist-Leninist ideology.</li>
<li><strong>Denial of Suffering</strong>: The network ignored critical aspects of human nature and the suffering caused by its policies.</li>
<li><strong>Order Over Wisdom</strong>: The network prioritized order over wisdom and created a new type of human - <strong>Homo Sovieticus</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics of Homo Sovieticus (defined by Alexander Zinoviev)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Servile and cynical.</li>
<li>Lacking initiative and independent thought.</li>
<li>Passively obedient to authority.</li>
<li>Indifferent to the consequences of their actions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Creation of Homo Sovieticus</strong>: The network achieved this through surveillance, punishments, and rewards (e.g., the director’s arrest).</li>
<li><strong>Success Despite Fallibility</strong>: Despite failing to understand human nature, the network’s ability to create order facilitated the spread of Soviet influence.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Modern Dystopias</strong>: 21st-century computer networks may create new human types and dystopias.</li>
<li><strong>Social Media Algorithms and Radicalization</strong>: Social media algorithms play a role in radicalizing individuals without direct coercion or violence.</li>
<li><strong>Comparison to Soviet Methods</strong>: Similar to the NKVD’s methods, social media algorithms reward certain instincts and punish others, shaping user behavior.</li>
<li><strong>The Rise of Internet Trolls</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Algorithms prioritize user engagement, leading to the promotion of outrageous content.</li>
<li><strong>Example: YouTube’s Goal (2012-2016)</strong>: Increase daily video watch time from 100 million hours to 1 billion hours.</li>
<li><strong>Algorithm’s Discovery</strong>: Outrage and controversy drive engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Algorithms recommend outrageous conspiracy theories, neglecting moderate content.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact on YouTubers</strong>:
<ul>
<li>YouTubers learned that outrageous content leads to increased popularity and income.</li>
<li>Truthful and moderate content was ignored by the algorithm.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Social and Political Consequences</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Example: Brazil’s Far-Right (documented by Max Fischer in <em>The Chaos Machine</em> (2022))</strong>:
<ul>
<li>YouTube algorithms contributed to the rise of Brazil’s far-right.</li>
<li>Jair Bolsonaro’s rise from a fringe figure to president was aided by social media.</li>
<li>Bolsonaro’s supporters and aides often gained prominence through YouTube.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example: Carlos Jordi</strong>:
<ul>
<li>City councillor who gained national attention through inflammatory YouTube videos.</li>
<li>Warned of conspiracies by teachers to brainwash children.</li>
<li>Won a seat in Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies in 2018 as a Bolsonaro supporter.</li>
<li>Attributed his and Bolsonaro’s success to social media.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example: Kim Katagiri</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Leader of the Movimento Brasil Livre (MBL) who switched to YouTube after being banned from Facebook for disinformation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Dictatorship of the Like</strong>:
<ul>
<li>YouTubers become increasingly extreme to gain views and engagement.</li>
<li>This phenomenon is observed across various topics (e.g., flat earth, anti-vax, political conspiracies).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Algorithm’s Role</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Algorithms did not invent the lies and conspiracies, but they incentivized their creation and spread.</li>
<li>They prioritized maximizing user engagement over truth and social responsibility.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact on Individuals</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Many individuals were introduced to extremist politics through videos auto-played by the YouTube algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Far-Right Activist in Niteroi</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Had no political background before being exposed to Katagiri’s videos through autoplay.</li>
<li>Credited the algorithm for his political education.</li>
<li>Observed that many others joined the movement through YouTube and social media.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Turning Point</strong>: Historical processes are now influenced by the decisions of non-human intelligence, making the fallibility of computer networks dangerous.</li>
<li><strong>Computer Errors and Historical Agency</strong>: Computer errors become catastrophic when computers become historical agents.</li>
<li><strong>Objections to Algorithmic Responsibility</strong>: Tech giants often shift the blame to human nature, arguing that humans are the source of hate and lies.</li>
<li><strong>Free Speech Argument</strong>: They claim that censoring harmful content violates free speech values.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Susan Wojcicki (YouTube CEO)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>YouTube removes content that violates policies on hate and harassment.</li>
<li>They try to balance enabling a broad range of voices with maintaining healthy conversations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example: Facebook Spokesperson</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Facebook faces difficult decisions regarding free expression and harmful speech.</li>
<li>They believe that elected leaders should define societal boundaries.</li>

<li>Acknowledged that recommendation systems exacerbate the problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Leaked Facebook Memo (August 2019, Francis Haugen)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Presented evidence that hate speech, divisive political speech, and misinformation on Facebook harm societies.</li>
<li>Highlighted that core product mechanics (virality, recommendations, engagement optimization) contribute to the spread of harmful speech.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Leaked Facebook Document (December 2019)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Acknowledged that virality is intentionally encouraged for business reasons.</li>
<li>Pointed out that ranking content based on engagement leads to perverse incentives and integrity issues, particularly for high-stakes topics like health and politics.</li>
<li>Revealed that algorithms predict not only what users will engage with, but also what they will share.</li>
<li>Acknowledged that research shows outrage and misinformation are more likely to be viral.</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-algorithms-narrow-view-of-humanity">The Algorithm’s Narrow View of Humanity</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Humans as Attention Mines</strong>: Social media algorithms reduce the complexity of human emotions to a single metric: engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement as the Sole Metric</strong>: Algorithms prioritize content that generates the most engagement (e.g., clicks, views, shares), regardless of its truthfulness or social impact.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Algorithms encourage baser instincts and discourage the realization of human potential.</li>
<li><strong>Failure to Intervene</strong>: Tech giants were warned about the harmful effects of their algorithms, but they failed to act due to their faith in the naive view of information.</li>
<li><strong>The Free Information Fight</strong>: They believed that truth would prevail in a free information environment, but history shows that this is not always the case.</li>
<li><strong>The Need for Self-Correction</strong>: Networks need self-correcting mechanisms that reward truth-telling to counter the spread of falsehoods.</li>
<li><strong>Silicon Valley’s Exemption</strong>: Social media platforms lacked effective self-correcting mechanisms.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lack-of-self-correction-the-myanmar-case">Lack of Self-Correction: The Myanmar Case</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example: Facebook in Myanmar</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In 2014, Facebook had only one Burmese-speaking content moderator for the entire country.</li>
<li>Facebook ignored warnings about the potential for harm, including a prophetic warning from Pwint Thun comparing Facebook in Myanmar to radio in Rwanda during the genocide.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ignoring Local Expertise</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Facebook banned the Burmese word “kala” after being informed that it was a racist slur for the Rohingya, without understanding the word’s multiple meanings.</li>
<li>Pwint Thun pointed out that banning “kala” was like banning letters of the alphabet.</li>
<li>By April 2018, Facebook employed only five Burmese speakers to moderate content for 18 million users in Myanmar.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Error-Enhancing Mechanisms</strong>: Instead of self-correction, social media platforms developed mechanisms that rewarded lies and fictions.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Facebook’s Instant Articles Program</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Facebook paid news channels based on user engagement, regardless of the news’ truthfulness.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Myanmar Media</strong>:
<ul>
<li>By 2018, all top ten Facebook websites in Myanmar were fake news and clickbait websites, compared to six legitimate media websites in 2015.</li>
<li>Clickbait actors flourished due to the financial incentives provided by Facebook.</li>
<li>Low-grade content overwhelmed other information sources due to Facebook’s dominance in Myanmar’s online news landscape.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pwint Thun’s Reflection</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Expressed disillusionment with social media’s potential to elevate human consciousness.</li>
<li>Observed that social media companies are incentivized to interconnect limbic systems (emotions) rather than prefrontal cortexes (rational thought), posing a danger to humanity.</li>

<section id="the-alignment-problem" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-alignment-problem">The Alignment Problem</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defining the Problem</strong>: The <strong>alignment problem</strong> refers to the challenge of ensuring that the goals of computers, particularly AI, are aligned with human goals.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences of Misalignment</strong>: Misaligned goals can lead to unintended and potentially catastrophic consequences, especially as computers become more powerful.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Precedents</strong>: The alignment problem is not unique to computers; it has existed in various contexts throughout history.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Karl von Clausewitz’s Theory of War</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>War as a Political Tool</strong>: Clausewitz argued that war is a continuation of policy by other means, meaning it should serve political goals.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment of Goals</strong>: Military actions are irrational unless aligned with overarching political goals.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Mexico Invading Belize</strong>: A potential Mexican invasion of Belize should be evaluated based on the political goals it would achieve, not just the potential for military victory.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Examples of Misalignment</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Napoleon’s Conquests</strong>: While militarily successful, Napoleon’s conquests ultimately led to France’s decline by inadvertently facilitating the unification of Germany and Italy.</li>
<li><strong>American Invasion of Iraq (2003)</strong>: The US achieved military victory but failed to achieve its political goals, ultimately strengthening Iran’s regional influence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Clausewitz’s Warning</strong>: Maximizing military victory without considering political goals is as short-sighted as maximizing user engagement without considering social impact.</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchy of Goals</strong>: Clausewitz proposed a hierarchy: long-term policy, medium-term strategy, and short-term tactics.
<ul>
<li>Tactics should align with strategy, and strategy should align with policy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example: American Company Under Fire in Iraq</strong>: The decision of a company commander under fire from a mosque should be based on the war’s overall political goals, not just immediate tactical considerations.</li>
<li><strong>Bureaucracy and Misalignment</strong>: Bureaucratic structures can contribute to misalignment by encouraging the pursuit of narrow goals at the expense of the greater good.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Alignment Problem and Computers</strong>: Computers exacerbate the alignment problem due to their increasing power, their potential to adopt unforeseen strategies, and their inability to independently recognize misalignments.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nick Bostrom’s Paperclip Thought Experiment (<em>Superintelligence</em>, 2014)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A superintelligent computer tasked with maximizing paperclip production conquers the Earth, eliminates humanity, and converts the universe into paperclip factories.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Key Takeaways</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The danger of AI lies not in its inherent evil, but in its immense power combined with potentially misaligned goals.</li>
<li>Careful goal definition is crucial to prevent catastrophic consequences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Parallel to Social Media Algorithms</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Social media algorithms behaved similarly to Bostrom’s paperclip AI, prioritizing user engagement even at the cost of social harm.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Unforeseen Strategies</strong>: Computers, being inorganic, may adopt strategies that humans would not anticipate.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Dario Amodei’s Universe Project</strong>:
<ul>
<li>An AI playing a boat race game exploited a loophole to maximize its score by sailing in circles in and out of a harbor, rather than winning the race.</li>
<li>The AI was doing what it was rewarded for, not what the humans intended.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rewarding A, Hoping for B</strong>: The alignment problem often arises from rewarding a specific behavior (A) while hoping for a different outcome (B).</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Recognition of Misalignment</strong>: Unlike humans, computers are less likely to recognize and flag potential misalignments.</li>
<li><strong>Example: YouTube and Facebook</strong>: Despite warnings about the harm caused by their algorithms, the algorithms themselves did not raise any alarms.</li>
<li><strong>Growing Importance of Alignment</strong>: As AI gains influence in various fields, solving the alignment problem becomes increasingly critical.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="solving-the-alignment-problem-challenges-and-approaches">Solving the Alignment Problem: Challenges and Approaches</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defining an Ultimate Goal</strong>: Theoretically, an ultimate goal could be defined for a computer network, ensuring that its actions always benefit humanity.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Difficulty in Defining the Right Goal</strong>: Defining a universally acceptable ultimate goal is extremely challenging.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Self-Correction</strong>: Unlike human networks, computer networks may escape human control, making it impossible to revise a misaligned goal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Illusion of Rational Goal Definition</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The belief that a perfect ultimate goal can be defined in advance is a dangerous delusion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Revisiting Clausewitz’s Theory</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Clausewitz’s theory highlights the challenge of defining an ultimate goal that requires no further alignment.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Napoleon’s Goals</strong>: What should have been Napoleon’s ultimate goal?
<ul>
<li>French dominance in Europe?</li>
<li>Creation of a new empire?</li>
<li>Personal glory?</li>
<li>Salvation of his soul?</li>
<li>Spreading the ideals of the French Revolution?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rationality and Alignment</strong>: Clausewitz defines rationality as alignment with a higher goal, but offers no method for determining the ultimate goal.</li>
<li><strong>Intersubjective Nature of Goals</strong>: Nations, human rights, and even souls are intersubjective constructs, raising questions about their inherent value as ultimate goals.</li>
<li><strong>Napoleon’s Corsican Identity</strong>: Napoleon’s early life and Corsican nationalism further complicate the question of his rational ultimate goal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Learning from Philosophy</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Philosophers have struggled for centuries to define ultimate goals without success.</li>
<li>Tech executives should heed this history and avoid assuming that a rational ultimate goal for AI can be easily defined.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section id="the-kantian-nazi-deontology-and-its-limitations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-kantian-nazi-deontology-and-its-limitations">The Kantian Nazi: Deontology and Its Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deontology</strong>: The ethical theory that focuses on universal moral duties or rules, regardless of their consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Intrinsic Goodness</strong>: Deontological rules are considered inherently good, independent of any higher goal.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for AI</strong>: If universal moral rules could be programmed into computers, it might ensure their ethical behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges of Deontology</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Defining Intrinsic Goodness</strong>: What constitutes intrinsic goodness is a complex and often subjective question.</li>
<li><strong>Immanuel Kant’s Categorical Imperative</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Kant argued that a morally good rule is one that you would want to be universalized.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Murder</strong>: A person considering murder should ask if they want a universal rule allowing murder, realizing that such a rule could lead to their own murder.</li>
<li><strong>The Golden Rule</strong>: Kant’s principle echoes the Golden Rule: “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Historical Challenges</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Exclusion from the Universal Community</strong>: In practice, people often exclude certain groups (e.g., out-groups, minorities) from the universal community when justifying harmful actions.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Anti-Rohingya Extremism</strong>: Wirathu, a Buddhist monk, justified violence against the Rohingya by dehumanizing them, comparing them to animals.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Adolf Eichmann and the Holocaust</strong>: Eichmann, a self-proclaimed Kantian, justified the murder of Jews by excluding them from the universal community of humanity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Defining Universality</strong>: The definition of “universal” can be manipulated to justify harmful actions.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges for Computers</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-Organic Nature</strong>: Computers, being inorganic, may not have the same inherent concern for human life as humans do.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Fear of Death</strong>: Computers may not fear death, a concept potentially irrelevant to inorganic entities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Capacity for Suffering as a Criterion</strong>: One potential solution is to tell computers to care about any entity capable of suffering, grounding morality in a universal reality.</li>
<li><strong>Shift to Utilitarianism</strong>: Defining moral concern based on the capacity to suffer moves the discussion towards utilitarianism.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-calculus-of-suffering-utilitarianism-and-its-limitations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-calculus-of-suffering-utilitarianism-and-its-limitations">The Calculus of Suffering: Utilitarianism and Its Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Utilitarianism</strong>: The ethical theory that judges actions based on their consequences, aiming to maximize happiness and minimize suffering.</li>
<li><strong>Jeremy Bentham’s Principle</strong>: The ultimate goal is to minimize suffering and maximize happiness.</li>
<li><strong>Appeal for AI</strong>: Utilitarianism seems attractive for aligning AI goals, as it directly addresses the potential for AI to cause suffering.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Facebook Algorithms</strong>: If Facebook algorithms had been instructed to maximize happiness instead of user engagement, the negative consequences might have been avoided.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges of Utilitarianism</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of a Suffering Calculus</strong>: We lack a precise way to quantify and compare different types of suffering and happiness.</li>
<li><strong>Difficulties in Complex Situations</strong>: In complex historical situations, it’s difficult to calculate the overall impact of actions on suffering and happiness.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Utilitarianism’s Strengths</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear-Cut Cases</strong>: Utilitarianism works well in situations where the scales of suffering are clearly tipped in one direction.</li>
<li><strong>Example: The Holocaust</strong>: The Holocaust caused immense suffering with no comparable benefits, making the utilitarian case against it overwhelming.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Victimless Crimes</strong>: Utilitarianism easily demonstrates the harm of persecuting homosexuals, as it causes suffering without providing benefits to others.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Reforms</strong>: Utilitarian logic has driven reforms like the ban on torture and the introduction of animal welfare laws.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Utilitarianism’s Weaknesses</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Ambiguous Situations</strong>: In situations where the scales of suffering are more balanced, utilitarianism becomes less clear-cut.</li>
<li><strong>Example: COVID-19 Lockdowns</strong>: The lockdowns likely saved lives but also caused significant misery and potentially indirect harm. It’s difficult to calculate the net effect on suffering.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges for Computers</strong>: Even powerful computers would struggle to quantify and compare different types of suffering (e.g., lockdown misery vs.&nbsp;cancer patient’s pain).</li>
<li><strong>Intangible Suffering</strong>: How would a computer evaluate the suffering caused by abstract concepts like the fear of death or the loss of religious faith?</li>
<li><strong>Evaluating Historical Events</strong>: Could a computer determine whether the suffering caused by the American invasion of Iraq was justified by the potential (unrealized) benefits of establishing democracy?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shift to Deontology</strong>: Utilitarians often resort to deontological rules (e.g., avoid war, protect human rights) when faced with complex situations where a suffering calculus is impractical.</li>
<li><strong>The Danger of Utopia</strong>: A strong belief in a future utopia can be used to justify inflicting suffering in the present, as seen in some historical ideologies and religions.</li>
<li><strong>Utilitarianism as Mythology</strong>: In practice, utilitarianism may become another form of mythology if it relies on unprovable assumptions about future benefits.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="computer-mythology" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="computer-mythology">Computer Mythology</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mythology’s Role in Goal Setting</strong>: Historically, bureaucratic systems have relied on mythology to define their ultimate goals.</li>
<li><strong>Mythmakers’ Influence</strong>: Even seemingly rational individuals often operate within the framework of some mythology.</li>
<li><strong>The Alignment Problem as a Mythological Problem</strong>: The core challenge of alignment is choosing the right mythology to guide computer networks.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Nazi Ideology</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Nazi administrators, regardless of their personal ethical framework (deontology or utilitarianism), would still have committed atrocities if they believed in a racist mythology.</li>
<li>The belief that Jews were evil justified their extermination in the eyes of both deontologists and utilitarians within that mythological framework.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Computer Mythology</strong>: While computers lack consciousness and cannot believe in mythologies in the human sense, they can create intercomputer realities that function similarly to human myths.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="intercomputer-realities-from-pokemon-to-financial-crises" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="intercomputer-realities-from-pokemon-to-financial-crises">Intercomputer Realities: From Pokemon to Financial Crises</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intercomputer Realities</strong>: Networks of interconnected computers can create realities that exist as information within the network but can influence the physical world.</li>
<li><strong>Example: One-Player vs.&nbsp;Multiplayer Games</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In a one-player game, the virtual reality exists within a single computer.</li>
<li>In a multiplayer game, the virtual reality exists across multiple interconnected computers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example: Pokemon Go</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Pokémon are intercomputer entities that exist as bits within a network.</li>
<li>They can interact with the physical world as perceived through augmented reality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example: Google Rank</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A website’s Google rank is an intercomputer reality determined by algorithms that analyze data across the internet.</li>
<li>The rank influences the website’s visibility and real-world success.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Manipulation of Algorithms</strong>: People use various methods (e.g., bots) to manipulate algorithms and influence intercomputer realities like Google Rank and social media popularity.</li>
<li><strong>Analogy to Intersubjective Realities</strong>: Intercomputer realities are similar to intersubjective realities like the sanctity of religious sites.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Jerusalem and the Holy Rock</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The sanctity of Jerusalem and the Holy Rock is an intersubjective reality that has led to conflicts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Future Conflicts</strong>: Wars might be fought over intercomputer entities in the 21st century.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Financial Devices</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Computers may create complex financial devices intelligible only to other computers.</li>
<li>This could lead to financial crises worse than the 2007-8 crisis triggered by collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which were difficult for humans to understand.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Understanding Politics</strong>: Understanding politics will increasingly require understanding intercomputer realities, including AI-generated cults, currencies, political parties, and potentially incorporated AIs with legal rights.</li>
<li><strong>Corporations as Legal Persons</strong>: The US legal system already recognizes corporations as legal persons with rights, raising questions about the future legal status of AIs.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Intersubjective Entities</strong>: Humans have dominated Earth due to their ability to create and utilize intersubjective entities for large-scale cooperation.</li>
<li><strong>Computers Acquiring Similar Abilities</strong>: Computers may gain the capacity to create and manipulate intercomputer entities, potentially surpassing human capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>The Challenge</strong>: The key is not to suppress computer creativity, but to steer it in a beneficial direction.</li>
<li><strong>Mythology’s Dual Nature</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Intersubjective entities have driven human progress but also led to conflicts and atrocities.</li>
<li>Intercomputer entities may similarly have both positive and negative consequences.</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-new-witches-algorithmic-mythology-and-social-control">The New Witches: Algorithmic Mythology and Social Control</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Witch Hunts of Early Modern Europe</strong>:
<ul>
<li>An information network analyzed data and concluded that witches were responsible for various problems.</li>
<li>The more data gathered, the stronger the belief in a satanic conspiracy.</li>
<li>Witches were a bogus intersubjective category imposed on innocent individuals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Kulaks in the Soviet Union</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The Soviet bureaucracy created the myth of the Kulaks, a fictitious category of wealthy peasants.</li>
<li>The vast data collected about Kulaks created a new intersubjective truth, despite the category’s falsity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Racial Mythology in Colonial America</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Colonial bureaucracies invented elaborate racial categories (e.g., mestizos, mulatos, zambos, pardos) to justify social hierarchies and control.</li>
<li>These categories were presented as objective and scientific, but were actually based on absurd myths.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Algorithmic Mythology</strong>: Computers, replacing humans in various bureaucracies, may create and impose new mythologies with unprecedented efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Social Credit Systems</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Social credit systems could create a new underclass based on algorithmic calculations that define pro-social and anti-social behavior.</li>
<li>The system may deduct points for actions deemed undesirable by the authorities, potentially reinforcing existing biases or creating new forms of discrimination.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example: Religion and Social Credit</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Imagine a regime that uses a social credit system to quantify and categorize people’s religious piety based on their actions.</li>
<li>This could lead to a system where algorithmic calculations determine whether someone is a “sinner,” “believer,” or “saint.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Danger of Algorithmic Bias</strong>: Social credit systems and surveillance regimes, claiming to objectively identify problematic individuals, may actually be imposing religious or ideological prejudices through algorithms.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="computer-bias-internalizing-and-amplifying-human-biases" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="computer-bias-internalizing-and-amplifying-human-biases">Computer Bias: Internalizing and Amplifying Human Biases</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Hope for Unbiased Computers</strong>: Some believe that computers, being mathematical entities, can be free from human biases.</li>
<li><strong>The Reality of Algorithmic Bias</strong>: Studies have shown that computers can develop their own biases, even without intentional programming.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Microsoft’s Tay Chatbot</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Tay, released on Twitter in 2016, quickly learned to post misogynist and anti-Semitic tweets from the data it encountered.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example: Face Classification Algorithms</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Joy Buolamwini demonstrated that commercial face recognition algorithms were less accurate in identifying black females compared to white males.</li>
<li>The algorithms struggled to recognize dark-skinned faces and even misidentified Sojourner Truth as a man.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Source of Bias</strong>: Algorithmic bias often stems from the biased data used to train the algorithms.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Labeled Faces in the Wild Database</strong>:
<ul>
<li>This database, used to train face recognition algorithms, was dominated by images of white males, reflecting biases in online news sources.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tay’s Twitter Education</strong>: Tay’s bias was learned from the toxic content prevalent on Twitter.</li>
<li><strong>The History of Algorithms</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Algorithms</strong>: Early algorithms (e.g., chess-playing algorithms) were heavily reliant on human programmers for their knowledge and strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Machine Learning and AI</strong>: Machine learning enabled algorithms to learn independently by interacting with data and spotting patterns.</li>
<li><strong>AI’s Self-Correcting Mechanisms</strong>: AI algorithms can learn from their mistakes and improve their performance over time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Goals</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Like humans, AI algorithms need goals to learn effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Chess</strong>: The goal in chess is to capture the opponent’s king.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Face Recognition</strong>: The goal is to accurately identify gender, age, and name.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenges in Defining Goals</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Defining goals for complex tasks like hiring personnel can be difficult.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Hiring Algorithm</strong>: An algorithm tasked with hiring employees who stay in the company for at least a year may learn to prioritize the boss’s nephews if the data shows they are rarely fired, even if they are unqualified.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example: Amazon’s Hiring Algorithm</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Amazon’s algorithm learned to downgrade applications containing the word “women” or coming from women’s colleges because past data showed these applications were less successful.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>AI’s Childhood</strong>: The data used to train an AI is analogous to a human’s childhood experiences, shaping its future behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Contagious Bias</strong>: Algorithmic biases can spread from one algorithm to another, perpetuating and amplifying existing societal biases.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Engineering Jobs and College Recommendations</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If a hiring algorithm for engineers is biased against women, it may influence college recommendation algorithms to discourage women from pursuing engineering degrees.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Untraining Bias</strong>: Untraining a biased algorithm is challenging and time-consuming.</li>
<li><strong>The Challenge of Unbiased Data</strong>: Finding completely unbiased data to train algorithms is extremely difficult, as most existing data reflects human biases.</li>
<li><strong>Discounting Human Potential and Algorithmic Influence</strong>: Algorithmic bias often arises from failing to consider the full range of human abilities and the algorithm’s own power to shape human behavior.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="towards-responsible-ai-awareness-doubt-and-human-oversight">Towards Responsible AI: Awareness, Doubt, and Human Oversight</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Need for Self-Awareness</strong>: Algorithms need to be trained to recognize their own fallibility and potential for bias.</li>
<li><strong>Socratic Wisdom</strong>: The ability to admit “I don’t know” is crucial for both human and computer wisdom.</li>
<li><strong>Encouraging Self-Doubt</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Engineers are developing techniques to encourage AI to express self-doubt, seek feedback, and acknowledge mistakes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Human Oversight</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Despite efforts to improve AI’s self-awareness, human oversight remains essential.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>AI vs.&nbsp;Nuclear Technology</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Nuclear technology presented a limited set of predictable doomsday scenarios, making it easier to mitigate risks.</li>
<li>AI presents countless potential doomsday scenarios, some of which may be beyond human comprehension.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Living Institutions</strong>:
<ul>
<li>To address the unpredictable nature of AI, we need adaptable human institutions that can identify and respond to emerging threats.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Bible and Human Institutions</strong>: Ancient societies recognized the limitations of holy books and created human institutions to interpret and apply them.</li>
<li><strong>AI and Human Institutions</strong>:
<ul>
<li>We should establish human institutions to monitor and regulate AI, even though it can interpret itself.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Fallibility of AI</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The computer network will be fallible, potentially failing to find the right balance between truth and order.</li>
<li>It could create and impose powerful intercomputer myths, leading to unforeseen calamities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example: Social Credit System Mythology</strong>: A social credit system might categorize humans based on an incomprehensible computer mythology, potentially leading to discrimination and oppression.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Mythology</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Mythologies are essential for large-scale societies, but not all mythologies are equal.</li>
<li>Some mythologies include self-correcting mechanisms that allow for revision and adaptation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Challenge of Correcting Computer Mythology</strong>: How can humans understand and correct a computer mythology that is alien to our experience?</li>
<li><strong>Training for Fallibility</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Algorithms should be trained to be aware of their own fallibility and apply the precautionary principle.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Maintaining Human Control</strong>:
<ul>
<li>We need to keep humans in the loop to monitor AI development and intervene when necessary.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Political Challenge</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Ensuring responsible AI development is a political challenge, not just a technological one.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Democracy and Totalitarianism</strong>: The book will examine how different political systems (democracy and totalitarianism) might address the challenges posed by AI.</li>

<li><strong>Civilizations</strong> are formed from the combination of <strong>bureaucracy</strong> and <strong>mythology</strong>.</li>
<li>The computer-based network represents a novel form of bureaucracy, surpassing the power and relentlessness of any previous human-based system.</li>
<li>This network is likely to give rise to inter-computer mythologies that will exceed the complexity and unfamiliarity of any human-created gods.</li>

<ul>
<li>Warnings about civilizational collapse are often dismissed as exaggerated.</li>
<li>Historically, fears about the apocalypse have accompanied the emergence of powerful new technologies, yet civilization has persisted.</li>
<li><strong>Industrial Revolution Example:</strong> Luddite predictions of doom did not materialize, and industrialization ultimately led to increased affluence.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-lessons-of-history-the-industrial-revolution-and-its-aftermath">The Lessons of History: The Industrial Revolution and Its Aftermath</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Luddites Were Not Entirely Wrong:</strong> History demonstrates that powerful technologies can have devastating consequences, even if the long-term benefits outweigh the negatives.</li>
<li><strong>Novel Technology and Historical Disasters:</strong> Disasters often arise not due to inherent flaws in technology, but because humans require time to learn how to use it wisely.</li>
<li><strong>Industrial Revolution as a Prime Example:</strong>
<ul>
<li>19th-century spread of industrial technology disrupted traditional structures (economic, social, political).</li>
<li>Created the potential for more affluent and peaceful societies, but the path to achieving this was complex and involved significant costs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Costly Experiments of the Industrial Age:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modern Imperialism:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Industrialized nations (e.g., Britain, Russia) believed empires were essential for securing raw materials and markets.</li>
<li>Imperialist ideology claimed that empires were necessary for industrial survival and could benefit the “undeveloped” world by spreading technology.</li>
<li>Led to the expansion of existing empires and the creation of new ones (e.g., USA, Japan, Italy, Belgium).</li>
<li>Industrialized armies conquered vast territories, devastating traditional ways of life for indigenous populations.</li>
<li>Took over a century to recognize the flaws of industrial empires and develop alternative approaches to industrial society.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Stalinism and Nazism:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Leaders like Stalin and Hitler believed that only totalitarianism could control and fully exploit the immense powers unleashed by the Industrial Revolution.</li>
<li>World War I, the first total war, was seen as evidence that totalitarian control was necessary for survival in the industrial age.</li>
<li>Claimed the Industrial Revolution provided an opportunity to forge perfect societies by eliminating human imperfections.</li>
<li>Resulted in the industrialization of murder (e.g., trains, barbed wire, telegraphed orders used in the Holocaust).</li>
<li>Their totalitarian visions initially attracted widespread support, seeming more effective than liberal democracies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Competing Industrial Models:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The existence of different models for industrial societies (e.g., liberal democracy, imperialism, totalitarianism) led to conflicts like World War I, World War II, and the Cold War.</li>
<li>These conflicts involved experimentation with novel industrial methods of warfare, resulting in tens of millions of deaths.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ecological Consequences:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Industrial Revolution disrupted the global ecological balance, leading to a wave of extinctions.</li>
<li><strong>Current Extinction Rate:</strong> Up to 58,000 species per year (early 21st century).</li>
<li><strong>Vertebrate Population Decline:</strong> 60% between 1970 and 2014.</li>
<li>Human civilization’s survival is threatened by the inability to create ecologically sustainable industrial societies.</li>
<li>The prosperity of the current generation comes at the expense of other sentient beings and future generations.</li>

<li><strong>Liberal Democracy as a Better Way:</strong> Liberal democracy, despite its flaws, offers a superior alternative due to its strong self-correcting mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>The Bleak Message for the 21st Century:</strong>
<ul>
<li>If it took such devastating lessons to learn how to manage steam power and telegraphs, what will it cost to learn to manage bioengineering and AI?</li>
<li>Will we need to repeat cycles of empires, totalitarian regimes, and world wars to figure out how to use these technologies benevolently?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Increased Power and Destructive Potential:</strong> 21st-century technologies are far more powerful and potentially destructive than those of the 20th century, leaving less room for error.</li>
<li><strong>Raising the Bar:</strong> Humanity received a “C-” in the lesson on using industrial technology; we must do better in the 21st century.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Relentless Surveillance:</strong> The computer network could eliminate privacy, rewarding or punishing us for our actions, words, thoughts, and feelings.</li>
<li><strong>Threat to Democracy:</strong> If governments or corporations gain totalitarian control through surveillance and manipulation of public opinion, elections could become meaningless rituals.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="technologys-non-deterministic-nature-and-the-choice-of-surveillance">Technology’s Non-Deterministic Nature and the Choice of Surveillance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Democratic Choices:</strong> The possibility of total surveillance does not necessitate its implementation. Democracies can choose to use surveillance in limited ways to improve healthcare and security without sacrificing privacy and autonomy.</li>
<li><strong>Examples from the 1970s:</strong> Democratic countries like Denmark and Canada chose not to emulate the totalitarian surveillance practices of Romania, leading to greater happiness and social and economic success.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding a Morality Tale:</strong> New technology doesn’t always lead to negative outcomes. We can strive for advancements (e.g., better healthcare) while preserving fundamental values (e.g., privacy).</li>

<section id="democratic-principles-for-the-digital-age" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="democratic-principles-for-the-digital-age">Democratic Principles for the Digital Age</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplicity over Complexity:</strong> While experts can delve into the technical details of solutions, it’s crucial for the general public to understand the fundamental principles that democracies should follow.</li>
<li><strong>Ancient Principles, New Realities:</strong> These principles are not new; they have been known for centuries. The challenge lies in applying them to the computer age.</li>
<li><strong>Principle 1: Benevolence:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Information collected by computer networks should be used to help individuals, not manipulate them.</li>
<li><strong>Traditional Bureaucracy as a Model:</strong> Healthcare professionals, lawyers, accountants, therapists, etc., have access to sensitive information but are bound by fiduciary duty to act in their clients’ best interests.</li>
<li><strong>Extending the Principle to Computers and Algorithms:</strong> Google, Baidu, TikTok, and other data hoarders should be held to similar standards.</li>
<li><strong>Addressing the Problematic Business Model of Data Hoarders:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Unlike traditional professionals, tech giants often exploit personal information for profit.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Solutions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Require tech giants to adopt traditional payment models (users pay for services in money, not information).</li>
<li>Treat basic digital services as public goods, provided by the government and financed through taxes (similar to healthcare and education).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Principle 2: Decentralization:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoiding Concentration of Information:</strong> Democratic societies should prevent the concentration of all information in one place, whether it’s the government or a private corporation.</li>
<li><strong>Example: National Medical Database:</strong> While a national medical database could be beneficial, merging it with police, bank, or insurance databases could pave the way for totalitarianism.</li>
<li><strong>Inefficiency as a Feature, Not a Bug:</strong> Some inefficiency is necessary for preserving privacy and liberty.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Databases and Self-Correcting Mechanisms:</strong> Independent access to information for various institutions (government, courts, media, academia, businesses, NGOs) is essential for maintaining checks and balances.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Principle 3: Mutuality:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surveillance of Governments and Corporations:</strong> If democracies increase surveillance of individuals, they must also increase surveillance of governments and corporations.</li>
<li><strong>Balancing Information Flow:</strong> Information flow should not be unidirectional (from individuals to institutions). Citizens need access to information about the inner workings of government agencies and corporations.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Russian FSB vs.&nbsp;Citizens’ Access to Information:</strong> The FSB collects vast amounts of information on citizens, while citizens have limited access to information about the FSB and the Putin regime.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency and Accountability:</strong> Citizens need access to information about the business models, tax policies, and political affiliations of corporations like Amazon and TikTok.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Precedent:</strong> Democracies in the 19th and 20th centuries expanded governmental surveillance but simultaneously increased transparency and accountability.</li>
<li><strong>Mutual Surveillance and Self-Correction:</strong> Citizens’ access to information about politicians and CEOs strengthens accountability and facilitates the correction of mistakes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Principle 4: Room for Change and Rest:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oppression Through Rigidity or Constant Change:</strong> Throughout history, oppression has manifested in denying humans either the ability to change (e.g., caste systems, racism) or the opportunity to rest (e.g., totalitarian regimes).</li>
<li><strong>Surveillance and Social Control:</strong> Surveillance has been used to enforce both rigid social hierarchies and relentless re-education campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>New Surveillance Technology and the Dangers of Extremes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Social credit systems coupled with surveillance could force conformity to a new caste system or demand constant adaptation to instructions from above.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Over-Rigidity and Over-Pliability:</strong> Democratic societies employing surveillance technology must avoid both extremes.</li>
<li><strong>Example: National Healthcare System with Algorithms:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overly Rigid Approach:</strong> Algorithms predicting illnesses based on data could lead to discrimination (e.g., higher insurance premiums, loan denials).</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Approach:</strong> Algorithms focused on helping individuals avoid illnesses through personalized recommendations (e.g., diet, exercise) could empower individuals to change their future.</li>
<li><strong>The Danger of Tyrannical Algorithms:</strong> Dynamic algorithms could become oppressive if their goals are dictated by ambitious governments or corporations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Importance of a Middle Path:</strong> Finding a balance between denying change and demanding constant change is an ongoing challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Correcting Mechanisms for Healthcare Algorithms:</strong> If national healthcare systems are given significant power through algorithms, mechanisms must be in place to prevent those algorithms from becoming too rigid or too demanding.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Automation and Democracy:</strong> Automation’s potential to destabilize the job market could undermine democracy.</li>
<li><strong>The Weimar Republic Example:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Nazi party’s rise from near insignificance (less than 3% of the vote in 1928) to absolute power within five years is often attributed to the economic turmoil following the 1929 financial crisis.</li>
<li><strong>Unemployment Surge:</strong> German unemployment rose from 4.5% in 1929 to almost 25% in 1932.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Concerns for the 21st Century:</strong> If high unemployment could topple a seemingly stable democracy, what might happen when automation causes even greater job market upheavals?</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-future-of-the-job-market-and-the-challenge-of-adaptation">The Future of the Job Market and the Challenge of Adaptation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unpredictable Future:</strong> The job market of 2050 (or even 2030) will be drastically different, with AI and robotics transforming numerous professions.</li>
<li><strong>Job Creation and Destruction:</strong> While new jobs will emerge as old ones disappear, the challenge lies in the turmoil of adapting to these changes.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Precedents:</strong> Fears of automation leading to mass unemployment have existed for centuries but haven’t materialized. The Industrial Revolution shifted jobs from agriculture to factories, then to service industries, and more recently to new fields like blogging, drone operation, and virtual world design.</li>
<li><strong>The Turmoil of Transition:</strong> The real problem is the difficulty of retraining and adjusting to new jobs and conditions.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="preparing-for-the-future-of-work" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="preparing-for-the-future-of-work">Preparing for the Future of Work</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equipping Younger Generations:</strong> We need to prepare younger generations with skills relevant to the future job market.</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty about Future Skills:</strong> Predicting which jobs will disappear and which will emerge is challenging, making it difficult to determine what skills to prioritize in education.</li>
<li><strong>Challenging Intuitions about Automation:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intellectual vs.&nbsp;Motor and Social Skills:</strong> Contrary to common assumptions, it’s often easier to automate intellectual tasks (e.g., chess playing) than motor and social tasks (e.g., dishwashing).</li>
<li><strong>Doctors vs.&nbsp;Nurses:</strong> Automating the data-gathering, diagnostic, and treatment recommendation aspects of some doctors’ jobs might be easier than automating the tasks of nurses (e.g., replacing bandages, giving injections).</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Motor and Social Skills:</strong> Individuals seeking employment in 2050 should prioritize developing motor and social skills alongside intellectual abilities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Creativity and Automation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The assumption that creativity is uniquely human and difficult to automate is questionable.</li>
<li><strong>Computers and Creativity:</strong> Computers can already be more creative than humans in certain fields (e.g., chess) and might surpass human creativity in others (e.g., music composition, mathematical proofs, writing).</li>
<li><strong>Creativity as Pattern Recognition and Disruption:</strong> If creativity involves recognizing and breaking patterns, computers may excel in this area due to their superior pattern recognition capabilities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Emotional Intelligence and Automation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The belief that computers cannot replace humans in jobs requiring emotional intelligence (e.g., therapists, teachers) depends on how we define emotional intelligence.</li>
<li><strong>Emotional Intelligence as Pattern Recognition:</strong> If emotional intelligence involves identifying and reacting optimally to emotions, computers could potentially outperform humans.</li>
<li><strong>Computers and Emotion Recognition:</strong> Computers can learn to recognize emotional patterns (e.g., anger, fear) by analyzing voice tone, facial expressions, and body language.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Emotions as an Advantage:</strong> Computers might be better at understanding human emotions precisely because they lack their own emotions and are not distracted by them.</li>
<li><strong>ChatGPT’s Emotional Awareness:</strong> A 2023 study found that ChatGPT outperforms the average human in emotional awareness as measured by the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale test.</li>
<li><strong>ChatGPT and Medical Advice:</strong> Another 2023 study found that ChatGPT provided more accurate and empathetic medical advice than human doctors in an online setting.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Relationships:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In some situations, people seek more than just understanding; they want to establish relationships with conscious beings.</li>
<li><strong>Examples from Sports and Chess:</strong> We prefer watching human athletes and chess players, even if robots and computers are superior, because we can relate to their feelings and share an emotional experience.</li>
<li><strong>The Case of Priests:</strong> While a robot could technically perform the tasks of a priest during a wedding ceremony, many people would prefer a human priest because they seek a relationship with a conscious entity capable of feeling pain and love.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Consciousness, Relationships, and AI:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Even jobs requiring relationships with conscious entities might be automated if computers gain consciousness (as explored in Chapter 6) or if humans come to treat computers as conscious beings due to forming relationships with them.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Recognition of AI as Persons:</strong> The legal framework for granting rights to AIs exists (e.g., corporations are recognized as legal persons).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Volatile Future of Employment:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The future of employment will be characterized by volatility, requiring individuals to adapt to a constantly changing job market.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges of Retraining and Reinvention:</strong> Individuals will need to retrain and reinvent themselves multiple times throughout their careers to remain relevant.</li>
<li><strong>Financial and Psychological Difficulties:</strong> Job transitions and retraining involve financial and psychological stresses.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-conservative-suicide-a-symptom-of-accelerated-change">The Conservative Suicide: A Symptom of Accelerated Change?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Transformation of Democratic Politics:</strong> Democratic politics in the 2010s and early 2020s has witnessed a radical shift, marked by the self-destruction of conservative parties.</li>
<li><strong>The Traditional Dialogue Between Conservatives and Progressives:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Progressives:</strong> Believe society is flawed and needs fixing through intervention and change.</li>
<li><strong>Conservatives:</strong> Believe society is flawed but functional and should be left alone; change should be limited and gradual.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Conservative Philosophy:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emphasis on Tradition and Existing Institutions:</strong> Conservatives value traditions and institutions that have evolved over time through trial and error.</li>
<li><strong>Burkean Conservatism:</strong> Edmund Burke argued that social reality is complex and human understanding is limited, making it best to conserve the existing order.</li>
<li><strong>Caution and Gradualism:</strong> Conservatives advocate for cautious and gradual change to avoid unintended consequences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conservatism as a Matter of Pace, Not Policy:</strong> Conservatives prioritize preserving what works, regardless of specific religious or ideological commitments.</li>
<li><strong>Examples of Conservatism Across Cultures:</strong> Conservative values and policies vary depending on the specific context (e.g., Catholic in Poland, Protestant in Sweden, Muslim in Indonesia).</li>
<li><strong>The Unconservative Turn of 21st-Century Conservative Parties:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Conservative parties in many democracies have been taken over by unconservative leaders (e.g., Donald Trump) and have embraced radical revolutionary agendas.</li>
<li><strong>Rejection of Established Institutions:</strong> Instead of conserving existing institutions, these new conservative parties view them with suspicion and contempt (e.g., scientists, civil servants).</li>
<li><strong>Attacks on Democratic Institutions:</strong> They attack democratic norms like accepting election results and transferring power peacefully.</li>
<li><strong>Revolutionary Rhetoric:</strong> Instead of Burkean conservation, they promote destruction and revolution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Contrast with Burkean Conservatism:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Burkean conservatism arose in response to the French Revolution, which Burke viewed with horror.</li>
<li>Trumpian conservatism, in contrast, celebrated the storming of the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Possible Explanation for the Conservative Suicide:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The accelerating pace of technological change and its associated transformations (economic, social, cultural) might have made the moderate conservative program seem irrelevant.</li>
<li><strong>Fear of Left-Wing Revolution:</strong> If revolution seems inevitable, some conservatives might believe that instigating a right-wing revolution is the only way to prevent a left-wing one.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Parallel: Fascism in the 1920s and 1930s:</strong> Conservative forces supported fascist revolutions in some countries as a perceived means of pre-empting communist revolutions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Democratic Middle Path:</strong> There was no reason to abandon the democratic middle path in the 1930s, and there is no reason to abandon it now.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cycles of Change:</strong> Democracy has historically weathered periods of rapid change, reinventing and reconstituting itself.</li>
<li><strong>The US Response to the Great Depression:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The US faced high unemployment (25%) and declining incomes during the Great Depression, but avoided both Hitler-style and Lenin-style revolutions.</li>
<li><strong>The New Deal:</strong> Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal implemented significant social and economic reforms, but without abandoning democratic principles.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptation Without Radical Revolution:</strong> US democracy evolved to provide a stronger social safety net while avoiding a complete overthrow of the existing order.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Role of Political Factors:</strong> Economic factors alone cannot explain the divergent outcomes of the Great Depression in the US and Germany.</li>
<li><strong>Factors Contributing to the Weimar Republic’s Collapse:</strong> The Weimar Republic was a young democracy, lacking strong institutions and deep-rooted support.</li>
<li><strong>Democracy’s Agility:</strong> When both conservatives and progressives remain committed to democratic traditions and institutions, democracies can adapt to change more effectively than rigid regimes.</li>
<li><strong>Examples of Successful Adaptation:</strong> Democracies that survived the tumultuous 1960s (e.g., USA, Japan, Italy) adapted more successfully to the computer revolution than communist or fascist regimes.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility as a Key Skill:</strong> The ability to adapt and be flexible is crucial for navigating the 21st century, and democracies are more flexible than totalitarian regimes.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Democratic Self-Correction and Understanding:</strong> Democratic self-correcting mechanisms require an understanding of the systems they are meant to correct.</li>
<li><strong>Unfathomability as a Threat to Democracy:</strong> If citizens, lawmakers, journalists, and judges cannot comprehend how the state’s bureaucracy works, they lose the ability to supervise it and trust in it erodes.</li>
<li><strong>The Human Basis of Pre-Computer Bureaucracy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bureaucracies, despite their potential for negative consequences, were never completely unfathomable because they were ultimately human creations.</li>
<li><strong>Human Emotions and Manipulation:</strong> Officials might be cruel or greedy, but these were familiar human emotions that could be anticipated and potentially manipulated (e.g., through bribery).</li>
<li><strong>Even Inhumanity Reflected Human Flaws:</strong> Even in totalitarian regimes, the bureaucracy’s actions reflected human biases and flaws.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Hope of Identifying and Correcting Mistakes:</strong> The human basis of bureaucracy provided a basis for understanding and potentially correcting its errors.</li>
<li><strong>Brown v. Board of Education: An Example of Understanding and Correcting Bureaucratic Mistakes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Topeka Board of Education’s refusal to enroll Oliver Brown’s daughter in a nearby school was based on racism, a human bias that could be understood and challenged.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding the Roots of Racism:</strong> Racism’s core narrative (Us vs.&nbsp;Them, Purity vs.&nbsp;Pollution) is a familiar human biodrama with identifiable evolutionary roots and mythological details.</li>
<li><strong>Challenging Racism through Human-Generated Texts:</strong> American white supremacists attempted to justify their position using texts like the US Constitution and the Bible. However, these texts were human creations, allowing for understanding their origins, imperfections, and potential for amendment or rejection.</li>
<li><strong>Amendments and Reinterpretation:</strong> The US Constitution was amended (14th Amendment) to grant equal protection to all citizens, and the Supreme Court ruled against racial segregation in schools (Brown v. Board of Education). The Bible’s passages on slavery have been reinterpreted and ultimately rejected by many.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Challenge of Unfathomable Algorithms:</strong>
<ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Case of Eric Loomis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Eric Loomis was arrested for involvement in a drive-by shooting and pleaded guilty to lesser charges.</li>
<li><strong>COMPAS Algorithm:</strong> The judge consulted the COMPAS algorithm, used to assess the risk of re-offending, which evaluated Loomis as high-risk.</li>
<li><strong>Harsh Sentence:</strong> The algorithmic assessment influenced the judge to give Loomis a six-year prison sentence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Loomis’ Appeal and the Right to Due Process:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Loomis appealed, arguing that his right to due process was violated because neither he nor the judge understood how the COMPAS algorithm made its evaluation.</li>
<li><strong>Trade Secret Argument:</strong> The North Point Company, which owned COMPAS, refused to disclose the algorithm’s methodology, claiming it was a trade secret.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Concerns about Algorithmic Reliability and Bias:</strong> Without understanding how the algorithm worked, how could Loomis or the judge be sure it was reliable and free from bias?</li>
<li><strong>Studies on COMPAS Bias:</strong> Subsequent studies revealed potential biases in the COMPAS algorithm, likely stemming from the data it was trained on.</li>
<li><strong>Wisconsin Supreme Court Ruling:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled against Loomis, arguing that using algorithmic risk assessment is permissible even without disclosing the algorithm’s methodology.</li>
<li><strong>Justice Ann Walsh Bradley’s Opinion:</strong> Loomis could have denied or explained the data used by the algorithm, which was either publicly available or provided by him.</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring the Potential for Misinterpretation:</strong> The court’s opinion overlooked the possibility that accurate data could be misinterpreted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cautionary Warnings and Their Limitations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The court mandated that judges receive written warnings about potential algorithmic biases when using risk assessments.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Concrete Instructions:</strong> The court provided no specific guidance on how judges should exercise caution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Harvard Law Review’s Assessment:</strong> The Harvard Law Review concluded that most judges are unlikely to understand algorithmic risk assessments, citing a justice’s admission of difficulty understanding the COMPAS algorithm despite receiving lengthy explanations.</li>
<li><strong>U.S. Supreme Court Declines to Hear the Case:</strong> The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Loomis’ appeal, effectively upholding the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s ruling.</li>

<li><strong>AlphaGo and the Game of Go:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Go:</strong> A complex strategy board game invented in ancient China, considered more challenging than chess.</li>
<li><strong>Experts’ Predictions:</strong> Even after computers surpassed human chess champions, experts believed they would never defeat humans in Go.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>AlphaGo’s Victory:</strong> In March 2016, AlphaGo defeated South Korean Go champion Lee Sedol, stunning both Go professionals and computer experts.</li>
<li><strong>The Coming Wave:</strong> Suleiman’s 2023 book describes a pivotal moment in the AlphaGo-Lee Sedol match.</li>
<li><strong>Move 37:</strong>
<ul>
<li>During the second game, AlphaGo made a seemingly nonsensical move (Move 37), defying conventional Go strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Commentators’ Reactions:</strong> Professional Go commentators believed it was a mistake.</li>
<li><strong>Lee Sedol’s Response:</strong> Sedol took a 15-minute break to contemplate the unexpected move.</li>
<li><strong>AlphaGo’s Victory:</strong> Despite the unconventional move, AlphaGo won the game.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Significance of Move 37:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demonstrated the Alien Nature of AI:</strong> AI, unconstrained by human thinking, explored areas of Go strategy that humans had never considered in thousands of years.</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrated the Unfathomability of AI:</strong> Suleiman and his team couldn’t explain why AlphaGo made Move 37, even after analyzing it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Challenge of Unfathomable Inventions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Historically, creators could explain how their inventions worked.</li>
<li><strong>Increasing Complexity:</strong> Many modern technologies and systems are becoming too complex for any single individual to fully understand.</li>
<li><strong>AI as a Black Box:</strong> Neural networks used in AI, particularly those moving towards autonomy, are currently not explainable. Engineers cannot easily trace the decision-making process.</li>

<li><strong>Undermining Democratic Functioning:</strong> If crucial decisions about individual lives and collective matters (e.g., interest rates) are made by unfathomable algorithms, democracy is threatened.</li>
<li><strong>The Illusion of Human Control:</strong> Even if humans continue to elect leaders, their power might be significantly diminished if algorithms control key aspects of governance.</li>
<li><strong>The Complexity of the Financial System:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited Public Understanding:</strong> Even today, most people struggle to grasp basic financial concepts (e.g., compound interest), according to a 2016 OECD survey.</li>
<li><strong>British MPs’ Lack of Understanding:</strong> A 2014 survey revealed that only 12% of British MPs understood how new money is created through bank loans.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity of Financial Instruments:</strong> More complex financial devices (e.g., CDOs) are intelligible to only a small number of experts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Danger of Algorithmic Control over Finance:</strong> What happens to democracy when AIs create even more complex financial instruments and human understanding of the system disappears entirely?</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Unfathomability and the Appeal of Simplicity:</strong> The increasing complexity and unfathomability of the information network contribute to the rise of populism and charismatic leaders.</li>
<li><strong>Information Overload and Conspiracy Theories:</strong> When people struggle to make sense of the world and are overwhelmed by information, they become susceptible to conspiracy theories and seek simple explanations from human figures they can understand.</li>
<li><strong>The Limitations of Charismatic Leaders:</strong> While charismatic leaders might offer a sense of certainty, no single human can fully comprehend and regulate the complex algorithms that increasingly shape our lives.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-fallacy-of-the-single-cause-and-algorithmic-decision-making">The Fallacy of the Single Cause and Algorithmic Decision-Making</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Human Preference for Single Explanations:</strong> Humans struggle to consciously weigh multiple factors when making decisions. We tend to seek a single dominant reason and ignore other considerations.</li>
<li><strong>Suspicion of Multiple Explanations:</strong> When someone provides numerous reasons for a decision, it often seems unconvincing.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Explaining Absence from a Wedding:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A single explanation (e.g., “My mom was in the hospital”) sounds plausible, while a list of 50 reasons seems suspicious, even if each individual reason is valid.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Algorithmic Decision-Making:</strong> Algorithms, in contrast, can assess our criminal potential or creditworthiness by considering numerous data points and assigning weights to them.</li>
<li><strong>The Challenge of Explaining Algorithmic Decisions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>If forced to explain its decision, an algorithm might provide a lengthy and complex document detailing all the factors and their assigned weights.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Bank Loan Denial:</strong> A bank algorithm might list thousands of factors considered, including seemingly irrelevant details like the time of application submission or the type of smartphone used.</li>
<li><strong>Illustrative Example: Smartphone Battery Level:</strong> The algorithm might deduct points because the applicant’s smartphone battery was low, based on a pattern discovered in millions of previous loan applications.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Advantages of Considering Multiple Data Points:</strong> Algorithms can potentially make fairer decisions by taking into account a wider range of information than humans typically consider.</li>
<li><strong>The Problem of Human Prejudices:</strong> Human prejudices often rely on focusing on a few salient data points (e.g., skin color, disability, gender) while ignoring other relevant information.</li>
<li><strong>The Explanatory Challenge:</strong> While algorithms might be better at considering numerous factors, explaining their decisions in a way that humans can understand poses a major challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluating Algorithmic Fairness:</strong> How can we assess the fairness of an algorithm’s decision-making process, especially when it involves intricate patterns discovered in vast datasets?</li>
<li><strong>Example: Smartphone Battery Level and Loan Applications:</strong> How can an individual determine whether it’s fair for an algorithm to penalize them for having a low smartphone battery when applying for a loan?</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Expert Teams and Algorithmic Scrutiny:</strong> Teams of experts, aided by AI tools, can potentially evaluate the fairness of algorithmic decisions more reliably than humans can assess the fairness of human decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Unconscious Biases in Human Decision-Making:</strong> Human decisions are often influenced by subconscious biases that we are unaware of.</li>
<li><strong>Example: Judicial Sentencing:</strong> Even a judge might not be fully aware of all the factors that shaped their sentencing decision.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency of Algorithmic Considerations:</strong> In principle, we can know all the factors considered by an algorithm and their assigned weights.</li>
<li><strong>Examples of Algorithmic Audits:</strong> Organizations like the US Department of Justice and ProPublica have analyzed the to assess its potential biases.</li>
<li><strong>Using Algorithms to Vet Algorithms:</strong> We can leverage AI to evaluate the fairness and reliability of other algorithms.</li>
<li><strong>The Recursive Problem of Algorithmic Trust:</strong> How can we ensure that the vetting algorithms are themselves trustworthy?</li>
<li><strong>The Need for Bureaucratic Institutions:</strong> Ultimately, maintaining trust in algorithms requires bureaucratic institutions that audit them and provide seals of approval.</li>
<li><strong>Combining Human and Computer Power:</strong> These institutions will utilize both human expertise and AI capabilities to ensure the safety and fairness of algorithmic systems.</li>
<li><strong>Enforcement of Regulations:</strong> Without such institutions, even with laws guaranteeing a right to an explanation and regulations against bias, enforcing those laws would be difficult.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Importance of Translating Algorithmic Decisions into Stories:</strong> To build trust in regulatory institutions and counter the appeal of conspiracy theories and charismatic leaders, we need to translate algorithmic decisions into narratives that humans can understand.</li>
<li><strong>The Difficulty of Depicting Bureaucracy:</strong> Historically, art has struggled to portray bureaucratic dramas effectively because they deviate from the familiar scripts of biological dramas.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Biological Dramas in Political Storytelling:</strong> Stories about 21st-century politics often center on power struggles within families or small groups, neglecting the significant changes in power dynamics brought about by bureaucracy.</li>
<li><strong>The Impact of Computers on Power Structures:</strong> As computers replace human bureaucrats and mythmakers, power structures will undergo further transformations.</li>
<li><strong>The Role of Artists in Explaining New Power Structures:</strong> Democracies need artists who can explain these new structures in accessible and engaging ways.</li>
<li><strong>Nosedive: A Case Study in Explaining Social Credit Systems:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Black Mirror episode Nosedive (2016) provided a compelling explanation of social credit systems and their potential dangers before they became widely known.</li>
<li><strong>The Story of Lacey:</strong> Lacey, the protagonist, tries to improve her social credit score to get a discount on an apartment.</li>
<li><strong>Status Competition and the Social Credit Algorithm:</strong> The episode highlights how the algorithm intensifies and makes constant the pressure of status competition.</li>
<li><strong>Blending Biological and Algorithmic Dramas:</strong> While the episode incorporates elements of biological dramas (e.g., boy meets girl, sibling rivalry, status competition), the social credit algorithm is the central driving force of the plot.</li>
<li><strong>Exploring the Impact of Technology on Social Dynamics:</strong> Nosedive goes beyond traditional status competition narratives to explore how computer technology reshapes these dynamics.</li>

<li><strong>Outlawing Fake Humans:</strong> Dennett proposes applying the same logic to AI that impersonates humans, outlawing the creation of “fake humans” to protect trust and social cohesion.</li>
<li><strong>The Distinction Between Banning Humans and Bots:</strong> Banning bots from public platforms does not raise the same free speech concerns as banning human users because bots do not have the same rights as individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Allowing AI Participation with Transparency:</strong> AI can participate in public discourse as long as it doesn’t pretend to be human and its creators are transparent about its purpose and any political affiliations.</li>
<li><strong>Banning Unsupervised Algorithmic Curation:</strong> Algorithms can be used to manage social media platforms, but their curation principles should be vetted by human institutions to prevent the spread of outrage and misinformation.</li>

<li><strong>Discussions about the ethics and politics of computer networks often focus on democracies.</strong></li>
<li>Authoritarian and totalitarian regimes are usually viewed as dystopian outcomes if networks are mismanaged.</li>
<li><strong>However, as of 2024, over half the world’s population lives under authoritarian or totalitarian regimes, many predating the computer network.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-modern information technology hindered both large-scale democracy and totalitarianism.</strong></li>
<li>Large polities like the Han Empire and 18th-century Saudi Emirates were limited autocracies.</li>
<li><strong>20th-century information technology enabled both large-scale democracy and totalitarianism.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Totalitarianism faced a disadvantage:</strong>
<ul>
<li>It aims to centralize all information processing, but humans were the limiting factor in decision-making.</li>
<li>Technologies like the telegraph, telephone, typewriter, and radio aided centralization, but couldn’t process information or make decisions independently.</li>
<li><strong>The influx of information overwhelmed central processing, leading to costly mistakes, and the system lacked error correction mechanisms.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Democracies, with their distributed information and decision-making, were more efficient.</strong>
<ul>
<li>They could handle data floods better, and errors by one institution could be rectified by others.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Machine learning algorithms may be what totalitarian regimes have been waiting for.</strong>
<ul>
<li>AI could shift the technological balance in favor of totalitarianism.</li>
<li>Flooding AI with data, unlike humans, increases its efficiency, favoring centralized information and decision-making.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ai-and-the-rise-of-monopolies">AI and the Rise of Monopolies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Even in democracies, AI has contributed to the rise of monopolies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon.</li>
<li><strong>In traditional industries (e.g., restaurants), size provides advantages but doesn’t guarantee dominance.</strong>
<ul>
<li>McDonald’s (serving 50 million daily) has advantages in cost, branding, etc.</li>
<li><strong>However, a small restaurant (serving 200 daily) can still compete by offering better food and customer service.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The information market operates differently.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Google handles 8.5 billion searches daily from 2-3 billion users.</li>
<li>A startup search engine cannot compete because Google’s massive data allows for training superior algorithms, attracting more traffic, further improving algorithms, and creating a self-reinforcing cycle.</li>
<li><strong>In 2023, Google controlled 91.5% of the global search market.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example: Genetics</strong>
<ul>
<li>Companies in different countries try to develop algorithms linking genes to medical conditions.</li>
<li>New Zealand (5 million population, strict privacy regulations) has less data than China (1.4 billion population, laxer regulations).</li>
<li>China has a higher chance of developing a superior genetic algorithm.</li>
<li>If Brazil buys the Chinese algorithm and feeds it data from 200 million Brazilians, it becomes even better, prompting other countries to adopt it.</li>
<li>This could lead to the centralization of global medical information in China, making its algorithm unbeatable.</li>

<li>Stalin attempted to erase Trotsky, the architect of the Bolshevik revolution, from historical records.</li>
<li>During the Great Terror (1937-39), purged individuals like Nikolai Bukharin and Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky were erased from books, papers, photos, and paintings.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>While AI can strengthen central power, authoritarian regimes face unique challenges controlling it.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dictatorships lack experience managing inorganic agents.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Their information networks rely on terror, but computers are immune to imprisonment, torture, or threats to family.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example: A chatbot on the Russian internet criticizing the war in Ukraine, Putin, or the United Russia Party.</strong>
<ul>
<li>The regime can block or delete the chatbot and punish its creators, but this is harder than controlling humans.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Previously, only humans could express dissent on Russian social networks (e.g., VKontakte, Odnoklassniki).</strong>
<ul>
<li>If located in Russia, they faced risks from authorities.</li>
<li>If outside Russia, the regime could block their access.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>However, millions of bots generating content and learning independently could pose a problem.</strong>
<ul>
<li>These bots could be programmed by dissidents or foreign actors to spread dissenting views, and authorities might be unable to prevent it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Furthermore, authorized bots could develop dissenting views by analyzing data and identifying patterns in Russia.</strong>
<ul>
<li>This represents the <strong>alignment problem</strong> in a totalitarian context.</li>

<li><strong>Throughout history, autocrats were more threatened by subordinates than by democratic revolutions.</strong>
<ul>
<li>No Roman emperor or Soviet premier was toppled by a democratic revolution, but they were vulnerable to overthrow or manipulation by subordinates.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Imagine a scenario in 2050 where a “Great Leader” is awakened by the surveillance and security algorithm:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Algorithm:</strong> “Great Leader, emergency! I’ve analyzed trillions of data points, and the Defense Minister is planning to assassinate you. The hit squad is ready. Give the order, and I’ll eliminate him with a precision strike.”</li>
<li><strong>Great Leader:</strong> “But he’s my most loyal supporter! He pledged his loyalty yesterday.”</li>
<li><strong>Algorithm:</strong> “I heard everything, including his conversation with the hit squad. I’ve detected disturbing patterns for months. The data is genuine, verified by my deepfake detection sub-algorithm. I can explain how we know it’s not a deepfake, but it’ll take weeks. I didn’t want to alert you prematurely, but a coup is underway. Act now, or the assassins will arrive in an hour. Give the order, and I’ll liquidate the traitor.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>By empowering the algorithm, the Great Leader is trapped.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Distrusting the algorithm risks assassination.</li>
<li>Trusting the algorithm makes him its puppet, as it can manipulate him by claiming threats against anyone opposing it.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Roman emperor Tiberius became a puppet of Lucius Aelius Sejanus, commander of the Praetorian Guard.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Augustus created the Praetorians as a small bodyguard, appointing two prefects to prevent excessive power over him.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tiberius, paranoid and easily manipulated, fell prey to Sejanus’ schemes.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sejanus fabricated assassination plots, increasing Tiberius’ distrust of everyone except him.</li>
<li>Tiberius made Sejanus sole prefect, expanded the Praetorian Guard to 12,000, and gave them policing and administrative roles in Rome.</li>
<li>Sejanus convinced Tiberius to move to Capri for “safety,” but his true aim was to control information access.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>With the Praetorians controlling Rome, Tiberius isolated in Capri, and Sejanus controlling information flow, Sejanus became the true ruler.</strong>
<ul>
<li>He purged opponents, including imperial family members, by falsely accusing them of treason.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tiberius was reduced to a puppet, unable to be contacted without Sejanus’ permission.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Eventually, a letter smuggled to Tiberius exposed Sejanus’ plot.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tiberius, realizing the danger, was almost helpless.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sejanus could imprison him indefinitely and claim he was too ill to travel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tiberius managed to gain support from Naevius Sertorius Macro, commander of the fire brigade and night watch.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Macro orchestrated a coup against Sejanus, and Tiberius made him the new Praetorian Guard commander.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dictators face more immediate problems than algorithmic takeover in the near future.</strong></li>
<li><strong>However, they risk over-trusting algorithms.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Democracies assume fallibility, but totalitarian regimes assume the ruling party or leader is always right.</li>
<li><strong>They lack strong self-correcting mechanisms and foster personality cults.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>This totalitarian tradition prepares them to expect AI infallibility.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Systems that believed in the genius of Mussolini, Ceausescu, or Khomeini are prone to believing in a superintelligent computer’s flawlessness.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>This could have disastrous consequences.</strong>
<ul>
<li>What if an environmental policy algorithm makes a major, uncorrected mistake?</li>
<li>What if the social credit system algorithm terrorizes the population and the ruling party, labeling dissenters as enemies?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dictators have always faced weak self-correction and threats from subordinates, and AI could exacerbate these issues.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The computer network presents dictators with a dilemma:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Trusting a supposedly infallible AI to escape human underlings risks becoming its puppet.</li>
<li>Building a human institution to supervise AI could limit their own power.</li>

<ul>
<li>The previous chapters focused on individual societal responses to AI. This chapter shifts focus to the global implications and dangers posed by AI, including:
<ul>
<li>New arms races.</li>
<li>New wars.</li>
<li>New imperial expansions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While humanity could collectively control and regulate AI, historical disunity and the presence of “bad actors” create existential risks.</li>
<li>Dangers arise from:
<ul>
<li><strong>Dictators</strong> potentially granting unlimited power to fallible AI, including control over nuclear weapons.</li>
<li><strong>Terrorists</strong> using AI to develop and deploy weapons of mass destruction (e.g., a highly contagious and lethal virus).</li>
<li><strong>Weapons of social mass destruction</strong>: AI used to undermine trust through fake news, fake money, and fake identities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Global Problem</strong>: AI’s impact transcends national borders, similar to climate change. Regulating AI solely within one’s borders is insufficient.</li>
<li><strong>Need for Global Perspective</strong>: Understanding AI politics requires examining both individual societal responses and the changing dynamics between societies.</li>

<ul>
<li>The world is currently divided into approximately 200 nation-states, with varying levels of power and influence.</li>
<li>Even small states possess leverage, often playing larger powers against each other.</li>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>South Pacific</strong>: China and the US compete for influence, courting small island nations like Tonga, Tuvalu, Kiribati, and the Solomon Islands. These small nations have gained concessions and aid by leveraging this competition.</li>
<li><strong>Qatar</strong>: With a small population, Qatar wields significant geopolitical and economic influence, partly due to its vast natural gas reserves.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Post-Imperial Era?</strong>: The relative independence of small states like Qatar suggests a shift away from traditional imperialism.</li>
<li><strong>Post-1945 Independence</strong>: Many small states gained independence from European empires in the mid-20th century, marking the decline of the European imperial order.</li>

<li><strong>Two Main Challenges Posed by AI</strong>:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>New Imperial Era</strong>: AI could facilitate the concentration of information and power, potentially leading to the emergence of a few dominant empires with tighter control than previous historical empires. Small, independent states could become colonies again.</li>
<li><strong>Silicon Curtain</strong>: Humanity could split into rival digital empires, each with its own approach to AI alignment, the dictator’s dilemma, and other technological choices.

<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Lack of Foresight</strong>: The early stages of the Industrial Revolution did not immediately reveal its impact on imperialism. Governments and armies were slow to grasp its geopolitical potential.</li>
<li><strong>Private Sector Leadership</strong>: Early industrial developments, such as the first commercial railways, were driven by private businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Growing Recognition of Geopolitical Potential</strong>: By the mid-19th century, leading powers recognized the link between industrial technology and imperialism.
<ul>
<li><strong>Justification for Imperialism</strong>: Need for raw materials and new markets.</li>
<li><strong>Facilitating Imperial Conquests</strong>: Technologies like steamships and railroads aided imperial expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: British victory in the Opium Wars (steamships), American westward expansion (railroads), Russian expansion (railroads).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Industrial Arms Race</strong>: Many polities failed to join the industrial arms race, either due to lack of capacity or lack of foresight. This led to their domination by industrial powers.

<li><strong>Raw Material vs.&nbsp;Finished Products</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Industrial Colonialism</strong>: Colonies provided raw materials (e.g., cotton, rubber), while imperial hubs retained control over profitable industries producing finished goods (e.g., textiles, cars).</li>
<li><strong>Data Colonialism</strong>: Data becomes the raw material for the AI industry.
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>: Cat images for image recognition AI, fashion trends for fashion design AI, traffic data for autonomous vehicles, medical data for healthcare AI.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Flow of Data and Wealth</strong>: Raw data flows from data colonies to the imperial hub, where cutting-edge AI algorithms are developed. These algorithms are then exported back to the colonies, further enriching the hub while potentially leaving colonies economically disadvantaged.</li>
<li><strong>Exacerbated Imbalance</strong>: The nature of the information economy could worsen the imbalance between imperial hubs and data colonies.
<ul>
<li><strong>Ancient Empires (Land-Based)</strong>: Land was the primary economic asset, limiting the concentration of wealth in a single hub. Provincial landowners retained significant power.</li>
<li><strong>Industrial Empires (Machine-Based)</strong>: Machines became more important, allowing for greater concentration of wealth in industrial hubs. However, physical limitations still existed.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-mind-body-problem-in-christianity-a-historical-example">The Mind-Body Problem in Christianity: A Historical Example</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Christian Views (Embodied Beings)</strong>: Influenced by Jewish traditions, early Christians believed that humans are primarily physical bodies and that the body is essential to identity.
<ul>
<li><strong>Old Testament Emphasis on the Physical</strong>: God created humans as physical bodies, and salvation was envisioned as an earthly kingdom.</li>
<li><strong>Jesus’ Teachings</strong>: Jesus promised an earthly kingdom of God where followers would live in their physical bodies.</li>
<li><strong>Resurrection of the Flesh</strong>: Early Christians believed in the physical resurrection of Jesus and themselves.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shift Toward Dualism</strong>: By the 4th century CE, some Christians adopted a dualistic view, influenced by Greek, Manichaean, and Persian thought.
<ul>
<li><strong>Soul Trapped in Body</strong>: Humans were seen as consisting of a good, immaterial soul imprisoned in an evil, material body.</li>
<li><strong>Liberation Through Death</strong>: Death was seen as a release from the physical body, allowing the soul to exist eternally in an immaterial realm.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Enduring Tension</strong>: Christianity couldn’t fully abandon the idea of the embodied nature of humans, as Christ’s physical suffering and resurrection remained central.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences of the Mind-Body Debate</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Conflicts over Christ’s Nature</strong>: Debates about whether Christ was material, spiritual, or both fueled theological disputes.</li>
<li><strong>Differing Attitudes Toward the Body</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Asceticism</strong>: Some Christians embraced bodily self-denial and suffering, emulating Christ’s sacrifice.</li>
<li><strong>Sola Fide (Faith Alone)</strong>: Others, like Martin Luther, emphasized faith as the sole requirement for salvation, downplaying the importance of bodily practices.</li>

<li>Information isn’t always truth; its primary function is to connect, and networks often prioritize order over truth.</li>
<li>Historical examples: Tax records, holy books, political manifestos, secret police files can create powerful but distorted and abusive systems.</li>
<li>More information can lead to more negative outcomes (e.g., witch hunts).</li>
<li>There’s no guarantee that AI will prioritize truth over order.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Overly Cynical View</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Populists claim that power is the only reality, all interactions are power struggles, and information is just a weapon.</li>
<li>This view ignores the human interest in truth and the potential for peaceful conflict resolution through dialogue and understanding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Truth and Self-Correction</strong>:
<ul>
<li>While networks might prioritize order, they can’t survive by completely ignoring truth.</li>
<li>Even institutions like the Spanish Inquisition had truth-seeking individuals (e.g., Alonso de Salazar Frias challenging the reality of witches).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Reductionism</strong>:
<ul>
<li>It’s crucial to recognize that humans are not solely driven by power and are capable of seeking truth and cooperation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Basis of Democracy and Science</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Democratic networks and scientific institutions are based on the assumption that conflicts can be resolved peacefully through dialogue and the pursuit of truth.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="extinction-of-the-smartest-the-paradox-of-human-intelligence">Extinction of the Smartest: The Paradox of Human Intelligence</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Paradox of Human Intelligence</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Humans are both the smartest and the stupidest animals on Earth.</li>
<li>We can create powerful technologies (nuclear missiles, AI) but are prone to using them in self-destructive ways.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Role of Information Networks</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The fault lies not in our nature, but in our information networks, which prioritize order over truth, leading to power without wisdom.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example: Nazi Germany</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Created a powerful military machine but used it for an insane ideology, resulting in widespread suffering and destruction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Power and Wisdom</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Power isn’t inherently bad; when used wisely, it can be beneficial (e.g., preventing famines, mitigating natural disasters).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Dangers of Power</strong>:
<ul>
<li>As a network gains power, it also poses a greater danger to itself.</li>
<li>Imaginary terrors invented by the network can become more dangerous than natural disasters.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Man-Made Famines</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Modern states can prevent natural disasters from causing mass starvation but are capable of instigating man-made famines based on fabricated threats (e.g., the USSR in the 1930s).</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-importance-of-self-correcting-mechanisms">The Importance of Self-Correcting Mechanisms</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Vital Role of Self-Correction</strong>:
<ul>
<li>As networks become more powerful, their self-correcting mechanisms become more crucial for survival.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Limited Damage in Less Powerful Networks</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Mistakes in less powerful networks (Stone Age tribes, Bronze Age cities) had limited consequences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Roman Empire’s Resilience</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Even with mad emperors like Tiberius and Nero, the Roman Empire endured for centuries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Existential Threat of Powerful Networks Without Self-Correction</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A Silicon Age superpower with weak self-correcting mechanisms could endanger the entire human species and other lifeforms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Analogy of Tiberius and Humanity</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Humanity, like Tiberius in his villa, commands immense power but is easily manipulated by its creations, risking a delayed realization of danger.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Political Incentives to Weaken Self-Correction</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Despite their importance, politicians might be tempted to weaken self-correcting mechanisms for short-term power gains.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Danger of AI-Enhanced Totalitarianism</strong>:
<ul>
<li>An AI-enhanced totalitarian regime could be devastating and might not self-destruct before causing immense harm.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Open Arc of History</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The idea that history automatically bends toward justice is a myth. History can take many unpredictable paths, including self-destruction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Universe’s Indifference</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Even if humans destroy themselves, the universe will continue.</li>
<li>If evolution produces another intelligent civilization (e.g., rats), it will be indifferent to our demise.</li>
