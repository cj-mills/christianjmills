## Requirements

To follow along with this example, you will need:

* A python environment with  [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) (**tip:** [Use conda](https://www.michaelphi.com/stop-installing-tensorflow-using-pip-for-performance-sake/))

  * ```bash
    conda install tensorflow
    ```

    or

  * ```bash
    conda install tensorflow-gpu
    ```

    

* A TensorFlow SavedModel ([download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RRuNOR4pj2tUw8VIBEgZ3gQJQf9nJk8T?usp=sharing))

The TensorFlow model used for this tutorial is a PoseNet model with a ResNet architecture. You can download the exact model [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RRuNOR4pj2tUw8VIBEgZ3gQJQf9nJk8T?usp=sharing). 

## Usage

### Installation

You can install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install -U tf2onnx
```

### Steps

1. Make sure the SavedModel file is named `saved_model.pb`

2. At a minimum, you need to specify the source model format, the path to the folder containing the SavedModel, and a name for the ONNX file.

   For example:

   * Model Format: `--saved-model`

   * Model Folder: `./savedmodel` 

     **Note:** Do not include a `/` at the end of the path.

   * Output Name: `model.onnx`

```bash
python -m tf2onnx.convert --saved-model ./savedmodel --opset 10 --output model.onnx
```

With these parameters you might receive some warnings, but the output should include something like this.

```bash
