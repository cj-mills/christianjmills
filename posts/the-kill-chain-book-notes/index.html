<ul>
<li><p>This book argues that the U.S. military is on a path to lose a future war against China, and that this trajectory must be changed.</p></li>
<li><p>The author, Christian Brose, draws on his extensive experience as a national security and military advisor, most notably serving as staff director for Senator John McCain on the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p></li>
<li><p>This role provided Brose with access to classified information, top defense officials, and insights into the concerning reality of the U.S. military’s eroding advantage over China.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="a-stark-warning-ignored" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-stark-warning-ignored">A Stark Warning Ignored</h4>
<ul>
<li>In 2017, Brose witnessed Senator McCain’s attempt to warn his Senate colleagues about the U.S. military’s vulnerabilities against China.
<ul>
<li>McCain, troubled by the military’s lagging technological advancement, organized a classified briefing for all 100 senators.</li>
<li>The briefing, based on concerning war game simulations, revealed a bleak outlook: the U.S. consistently lost in simulated conflicts with China.</li>
<li>Despite the gravity of the situation, only a dozen senators attended.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="a-grim-assessment-of-u.s.-capabilities" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-grim-assessment-of-u.s.-capabilities">A Grim Assessment of U.S. Capabilities</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>David Ochmanek</strong>, a former Pentagon official, has conducted extensive war game simulations for the Department of Defense, revealing a disturbing pattern:
<ul>
<li><strong>War Game Outcomes:</strong> The U.S. military consistently loses against China and Russia in these simulations, suffering heavy casualties and equipment losses while failing to achieve objectives.</li>
<li><strong>A Shocking Reality:</strong> This finding contradicts the prevailing assumption of U.S. military dominance, leaving many within the defense establishment in disbelief.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>A Consistent Pattern of Defeat:</strong> War game simulations over the past decade consistently show the U.S. losing against China.
<ul>
<li><strong>A Well-Kept Secret:</strong> This information remains largely unknown to the American public and even many members of Congress, despite being acknowledged within the Department of Defense.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-conversation-with-senator-mccain-imagining-a-war-with-china">A Conversation with Senator McCain: Imagining a War with China</h4>
<ul>
<li>Following the poorly attended Senate briefing, Brose and Senator McCain engaged in a sobering thought experiment: imagining a potential war with China.
<ul>
<li>They agreed that the U.S. would not instigate a conflict, but acknowledged potential triggers such as:
<ul>
<li>A maritime incident escalating into conflict.</li>
<li>A Chinese attack on a U.S. ally prompting American intervention.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>They envisioned a scenario where the U.S. would face significant challenges in mobilizing and deploying forces.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-potential-war-with-china-key-vulnerabilities-and-challenges">A Potential War With China: Key Vulnerabilities and Challenges</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geographical Disadvantages and Logistical Nightmares:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Much of the U.S. military’s necessary equipment and personnel would be positioned thousands of miles away from the conflict zone.</li>
<li>Mobilization efforts would be hampered by cyberattacks and attacks on vulnerable supply lines, including cargo ships and aircraft.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Space and Cyber Warfare Dominance by China:</strong>
<ul>
<li>China would leverage its capabilities to target U.S. satellites, disrupting critical intelligence, communication, and GPS systems.</li>
<li>Command and control networks would be crippled by electronic, cyber, and missile attacks, leaving U.S. forces in disarray.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability of Forward Bases and Critical Infrastructure:</strong>
<ul>
<li>U.S. bases in Japan and Guam would be overwhelmed by barrages of Chinese ballistic and cruise missiles.</li>
<li>China’s hypersonic weapons, capable of maneuvering at high speeds, would render existing U.S. defenses useless.</li>
<li>Runways, operation centers, and fuel depots would be targeted, crippling U.S. operations and forcing evacuations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Air and Sea Power:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Older, non-stealthy fighter jets (F-15s, F-16s, F-18s) would be ineffective against China’s advanced air defenses.</li>
<li>Limited numbers of stealthy fighter jets (F-22s, F-35s) would be hampered by their short range and dependence on vulnerable aerial refueling tankers.</li>
<li>U.S. aircraft carriers would be forced to operate far from Chinese shores to avoid anti-ship missiles, limiting their effectiveness and making them vulnerable to attack.</li>
<li>China’s “carrier killer” missiles (DF-21 and DF-26) would pose a significant threat, potentially sinking carriers and causing massive casualties.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenges for the Marine Corps and Amphibious Operations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Marine Corps’ amphibious assault capabilities, designed for beach landings, would be largely ineffective against heavily defended Chinese territory.</li>
<li>The need to operate within range of Chinese missiles would severely restrict their ability to conduct traditional amphibious operations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Logistical Constraints and Depletion of Critical Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Key U.S. assets (submarines, long-range bombers, ground-launched missiles) would need to be relocated to the Pacific, taking crucial time.</li>
<li>Years of underinvestment and acquisition delays would result in a shortage of these assets and a rapid depletion of essential weapons.</li>

<ul>
<li>Despite spending more on defense than any other country, the U.S. military faces an existential crisis, challenging the prevailing notion of its invincibility.
<ul>
<li>This discrepancy between spending and effectiveness highlights a fundamental flaw in how the U.S. approaches national defense.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Problem with Platforms:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. military’s traditional focus on platforms (e.g., ships, planes, tanks) as the primary measure of strength is misguided.</li>
<li>Platforms are seen as tangible symbols of military might, influencing budgets, capabilities, and even institutional identity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Importance of the Kill Chain:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defining the Kill Chain:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The kill chain is the essential process by which militaries achieve their objectives, involving three key steps:
<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding:</strong> Gathering information about the battlespace and the enemy.</li>
<li><strong>Deciding:</strong> Analyzing information and making strategic and tactical decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Acting:</strong> Executing decisions to achieve desired effects, which may or may not involve lethal force.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Closing and Breaking the Kill Chain:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Closing the Kill Chain:</strong> Successfully completing the understand-decide-act cycle to achieve a military objective.</li>
<li><strong>Breaking the Kill Chain:</strong> Disrupting an adversary’s ability to complete the kill chain, neutralizing their effectiveness.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>A Universal Concept:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The kill chain is not unique to the military; it mirrors processes used in business, sports, and everyday life.</li>
<li>This framework highlights that while the military operates in a unique and high-stakes environment, its core functions are relatable and understandable.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Information Revolution and Its Unfulfilled Promise:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The information revolution of the 1980s promised to revolutionize warfare by enabling networked warfare and the disaggregation of the kill chain across multiple platforms.</li>
<li>However, the U.S. defense establishment failed to fully embrace this transformation, clinging to its platform-centric approach.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Failure to Adapt:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Despite advancements in information technology, the U.S. military’s kill chain remains slow, inflexible, and reliant on outdated systems.</li>
<li>Military platforms often lack interoperability, hindering their ability to share information and function as a cohesive network.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Legacy of Failed Modernization:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Previous attempts to modernize the military often focused on developing better versions of existing platforms using unproven technologies, resulting in costly procurement failures.</li>
<li>The U.S. military’s current predicament is partly a result of learning the wrong lessons from these failures, leading to risk aversion and a reluctance to embrace truly transformative change.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Rapidly Evolving Threat:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The information revolution is accelerating, driven by commercial technology companies, and these advancements have significant military applications.</li>
<li>China, capitalizing on these emerging technologies, poses a rapidly growing and evolving threat to U.S. military dominance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>China’s Strategic Approach:</strong>
<ul>
<li>China has meticulously studied the U.S. military, identifying its weaknesses and developing strategies to exploit them.</li>
<li>Instead of directly confronting U.S. strengths, China aims to deny the U.S. military the ability to project power and fight in its preferred manner.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Asymmetric Warfare and Technological Leapfrogging:</strong>
<ul>
<li>China has invested heavily in advanced weapons designed to disrupt U.S. battle networks, destroy expensive platforms, and break the kill chain.</li>
<li>This approach prioritizes achieving a decisive advantage through technological superiority and asymmetric capabilities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Rise of China: Economic and Military Power:</strong>
<ul>
<li>China’s economic growth fuels its military ambitions, potentially enabling it to match or surpass U.S. military spending within a decade.</li>
<li>This shift in the balance of power poses an unprecedented challenge, demanding a fundamental reassessment of U.S. defense strategy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>China’s Grand Strategy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>China’s ambitions extend beyond regional dominance to becoming the world’s leading power, supplanting the United States.</li>
<li>This strategy entails undermining U.S. influence globally, eroding its alliances, and promoting China’s model of authoritarianism.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exploiting Emerging Technologies:</strong>
<ul>
<li>China recognizes the transformative potential of emerging technologies and is investing heavily in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, robotics, and other fields.</li>
<li>These technologies are not only being used to enhance its military but also to strengthen its authoritarian control domestically.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>A Looming Crisis for the U.S. Military:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. military’s current trajectory puts it at a severe disadvantage against China’s asymmetric capabilities.</li>
<li>Continuing to invest in the same platforms and approaches will only exacerbate this vulnerability, playing into China’s hands.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Recognizing the Urgency:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. defense establishment must acknowledge the severity of the situation and the need for radical change.</li>
<li>Complacency and clinging to outdated paradigms will result in catastrophic consequences for U.S. security and global standing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shifting from Inputs to Outcomes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The focus should shift from simply acquiring platforms to building a more effective kill chain.</li>
<li>This requires prioritizing technologies and capabilities that enhance the U.S. military’s ability to understand, decide, and act faster and more effectively than its competitors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>From Platforms to Networks:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Instead of relying on small numbers of expensive and vulnerable platforms, the U.S. military must adopt a more networked and distributed approach.</li>
<li>This entails investing in:
<ul>
<li><strong>Interoperable Systems:</strong> Enabling seamless communication and data sharing between platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Resilient Networks:</strong> Developing robust networks that can withstand attacks and disruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> Leveraging AI for faster and more effective decision-making.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>From Offensive to Defensive:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. military must prioritize defensive capabilities that deter Chinese aggression and protect critical assets.</li>
<li>This includes:
<ul>
<li>Strengthening base defenses against missile attacks.</li>
<li>Developing more effective counter-space and cyber capabilities.</li>
<li>Investing in technologies that make U.S. platforms less vulnerable to detection and attack.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Embracing Autonomy and Unmanned Systems:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. military should accelerate the development and deployment of autonomous and unmanned systems.</li>
<li>This shift would:
<ul>
<li>Reduce reliance on vulnerable manned platforms.</li>
<li>Increase the speed and tempo of operations.</li>
<li>Enable the U.S. military to operate more effectively in contested environments.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rethinking Force Structure:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. military must move away from its traditional force structure of large, heavily manned platforms.</li>
<li>Instead, it should prioritize:
<ul>
<li>Smaller, more agile, and expendable platforms.</li>
<li>A greater emphasis on unmanned and autonomous systems.</li>
<li>A force that is designed for distributed and networked warfare.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Overcoming Institutional Inertia:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The biggest obstacle to transformation is not a lack of resources or technology but a lack of imagination and institutional inertia.</li>
<li>Overcoming this will require:
<ul>
<li>Strong leadership willing to challenge the status quo.</li>
<li>A cultural shift that embraces innovation and change.</li>
<li>A willingness to take risks and accept that failure is part of the innovation process.</li>

<ul>
<li>In 1991, amidst the backdrop of the Cold War’s end, Andrew Marshall, director of the Office of Net Assessment (ONA), initiated a project to assess the future of warfare.
<ul>
<li><strong>Andrew Marshall</strong>, often referred to as “Yoda,” held this influential position for 42 years, reporting directly to the Secretary of Defense.</li>
<li>The ONA’s primary mission was to evaluate the United States’ strategic standing against its competitors, mainly the Soviet Union.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Marshall, aided by Army Colonel Andrew Krepenevich, aimed to analyze the impact of emerging technologies and the Soviet Union’s collapse on international security and the U.S.’s role.</li>
<li>This project became particularly relevant after the U.S. waged war against Iraq in response to the invasion of Kuwait, a conflict heavily shaped by Cold War strategies and military structures.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-gulf-war-illusion-a-misleading-victory">The Gulf War Illusion: A Misleading Victory</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Gulf War (1991) unfolded as a demonstration of American military might, leaving a lasting impression on a young generation.
<ul>
<li>The conflict showcased technological advancements like stealth bombers, smart bombs, and superior air and ground power.</li>
<li>The U.S. achieved a swift victory with minimal casualties (129 combat deaths).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite the perceived success, Marshall’s 1992 report to the Secretary of Defense offered a different perspective.
<ul>
<li>He highlighted the influence of classified Soviet military writings that predicted a “<strong>military technical revolution</strong>.”
<ul>
<li>This revolution, termed the “<strong>reconnaissance strike complex,</strong>” proposed that advanced sensors and surveillance technologies, coupled with precision weaponry, would create the fastest, most effective kill chain in history.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While the Soviets saw the Gulf War as a testament to this concept, Marshall argued that the U.S. hadn’t even come close to achieving its full potential in this area.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A 1993 Pentagon study supported Marshall’s assessment.
<ul>
<li>The study revealed that the U.S. battle network remained largely unchanged since the Vietnam era.</li>
<li>It struggled to engage moving targets and relied heavily on “dumb bombs” instead of “smart” ones.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Admiral William Owens, future Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, later stated that the Gulf War was primarily won through “massed brute force,” akin to historical campaigns.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Marshall envisioned a <strong>revolution in military affairs (RMA),</strong> driven by information technologies.</p>
<ul>
<li>He cited historical examples of RMAs, such as the introduction of machine guns, steam-powered ships, and airplanes, emphasizing that technological advancements alone were insufficient.</li>
<li>Successful RMAs required developing new operational strategies and reforming existing military institutions for new strategic goals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Marshall warned that the U.S. was in the early stages of such a revolution, one that could last for decades.</p>
<ul>
<li>This RMA would center around information technologies that enhance understanding, decision-making, and action in war.</li>
<li>It would necessitate a shift in the concept of military power, potentially rendering traditional platforms like tanks, manned aircraft, and large ships less effective.</li>
<li>Marshall cautioned that failure to adapt to this RMA would leave the U.S. vulnerable to adversaries who successfully harnessed its potential.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Marshall’s analysts coined the term “<strong>anti-access and area denial capabilities</strong>” to describe how powerful adversaries could leverage this RMA to counter the U.S.’s platform-centric approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Despite its prescience, Marshall’s report failed to instigate significant change.</p>
<ul>
<li>The U.S., after the Soviet Union’s collapse, found itself in a unipolar world, with no immediate peer competitors.</li>
<li>This led to a sense of complacency, with leaders prioritizing a “peace dividend” by downsizing the military and focusing on peacekeeping and humanitarian missions.</li>
<li>The prevailing assumption was that future conflicts would resemble the Gulf War, fought against technologically inferior adversaries, allowing the U.S. to dictate the terms of engagement.</li>

<ul>
<li>Despite the lack of substantial change, the concept of RMA gained traction in Washington during the 1990s, driven by the fascination with the burgeoning information age.
<ul>
<li>“Revolution” and “transformation” became buzzwords, leading to numerous initiatives aimed at reimagining the U.S. military.
<ul>
<li>These initiatives included projects like “Army After Next,” “Network-Centric Warfare,” “Joint Vision 2010,” and “Lifting the Fog of War.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review, the Pentagon’s key strategy document, explicitly prioritized exploiting the RMA.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, despite the rhetoric and investments in defense technology, the U.S.’s way of fighting remained largely unchanged.
<ul>
<li>The interventions in Bosnia (1995) and Kosovo (1999) further reinforced this complacency.
<ul>
<li>These conflicts, won with minimal U.S. casualties (four non-combat deaths), were attributed more to adversary weakness than any significant U.S. transformation.</li>

<ul>
<li>The arrival of Donald Rumsfeld as Secretary of Defense in 2001 initially signaled potential progress.
<ul>
<li>Rumsfeld openly advocated for the RMA and created the Office of Force Transformation to oversee the development of new military technologies and doctrines.</li>
<li>He also signed a new defense strategy that prioritized addressing the operational challenges highlighted in Marshall’s 20XX war games, shifting focus toward emerging great powers like China.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, the 9/11 terrorist attacks drastically altered the strategic landscape, leading to a significant shift in priorities.
<ul>
<li>While Rumsfeld still emphasized transformation, the focus shifted towards waging a global war on terror.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The War on Terror did yield some genuine military innovations, primarily within the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC).
<ul>
<li>JSOC developed new technologies and tactics for counterterrorism missions, achieving remarkable speed and effectiveness in dismantling terrorist networks.</li>
<li>This innovation, along with the adoption of a counterinsurgency strategy in 2007, played a crucial role in weakening al-Qaeda in Iraq.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, the War on Terror ultimately sidetracked the U.S. from addressing the long-term challenge posed by China.
<ul>
<li>While the Bush administration claimed that both priorities could be managed simultaneously, the focus on counterterrorism, particularly the protracted conflict in Iraq, consumed the majority of resources and attention.</li>

<ul>
<li>Despite claims of transformation, the initial victories in Afghanistan and Iraq were, in essence, repetitions of past successes, achieved against significantly weaker opponents.
<ul>
<li>The U.S. retained its ability to dictate the terms of engagement, operate from secure sanctuaries, and leverage its technological superiority.</li>

<li>The core issue remained unchanged: the lack of urgency to embrace genuine transformation.
<ul>
<li>The perceived ease of these victories reinforced the belief in the U.S.’s military dominance and the validity of its traditional approaches to warfare.</li>
<li>Even as the Iraq War deteriorated into a strategic quagmire, the defense establishment largely dismissed it as an anomaly, clinging to outdated assumptions.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>A prevailing narrative within the defense establishment argues that the U.S. military’s lack of preparedness for future challenges stems from the overwhelming demands of the War on Terror, which consumed its budget and bandwidth.</p>
<ul>
<li>While the constant operational tempo undoubtedly took a toll, this narrative only tells part of the story.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The root cause lies in a failure of imagination and a misallocation of resources.</p>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. clung to the idea that a persistent global military presence, rather than investing in and showcasing innovative capabilities, would deter adversaries.</li>
<li>This strategy, however, led to the overextension and exhaustion of the military, with limited strategic gains.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Instead of prioritizing the development of faster, more adaptable kill chains through real-world experimentation, the U.S. poured vast sums into attempting to transform existing platforms, often with little success.</p></li>
<li><p>Billions were wasted on numerous modernization programs that were ultimately canceled without yielding any usable capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Examples include the Army’s Future Combat System ($18.1 billion), the Marine Corps’ Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle ($3.3 billion), and a host of other projects across all services.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Even those programs that weren’t canceled often faced significant delays, cost overruns, and ultimately failed to deliver the promised “transformational” capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>This includes high-profile programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Ford-class aircraft carrier, the KC-46 refueling tanker, and the Littoral Combat Ship, as well as numerous lesser-known systems.</li>
<li>Many of these systems were rushed into development before the underlying technologies were mature, leading to persistent problems and escalating costs.</li>

<ul>
<li>Systems were often designed with incompatible communication and data-sharing protocols, hindering their ability to function as a cohesive network.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A prime example is the inability of the F-22 and F-35A fighter jets, both Air Force programs built by the same company, to directly share basic targeting data.
<ul>
<li>This lack of seamless integration forced reliance on outdated communication methods, such as voice transmissions.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>The Pentagon and Congress essentially got military modernization backward, prioritizing incremental upgrades to existing platforms (tanks, manned aircraft, large satellites, and ships) over the development of integrated battle networks.</p>
<ul>
<li>This approach ignored Marshall’s warnings that these legacy systems would become increasingly vulnerable in a future characterized by advanced reconnaissance strike complexes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The result was a collection of disparate sensors and weapons systems, lacking seamless interoperability and requiring significant time and effort to function cohesively.</p></li>
<li><p>This outcome was not an accident but rather a consequence of a system that valued platforms over networks and incentivized the preservation of existing structures.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>The Iraq War ultimately dealt a fatal blow to the concept of RMA, but not in the way Rumsfeld initially envisioned.</p>
<ul>
<li>As the conflict dragged on, revealing critical equipment shortages (body armor, blast-resistant vehicles, and unmanned surveillance aircraft) and mounting casualties, the idea of technological transformation became associated with a failure to adequately equip and support troops in the present.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This fueled a backlash against “revolution,” shifting the focus back to conventional warfare and traditional platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li>By 2008, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates criticized what he termed “next-war-itis,” arguing against prioritizing future needs over current demands.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In reality, the more pervasive affliction was “last-war-itis” – an overreliance on past successes and a reluctance to adapt to a changing strategic environment.</p></li>
<li><p>The U.S., instead of embracing transformation, doubled down on its existing playbook, prioritizing legacy systems and preparing for conflicts that resembled those it had already fought.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Despite inheriting two wars and a global financial crisis, the Obama administration largely continued the trend of prioritizing present demands over future preparedness.</p>
<ul>
<li>While President Obama campaigned on ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, his tenure saw a continuation of these conflicts and the expansion of military operations into Libya, Yemen, Syria, and elsewhere.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Although Obama called for a “pivot to Asia” to counter China’s rise, and his administration initiated the “Air-Sea Battle” concept to address China’s growing military capabilities in the western Pacific, these efforts were undermined by budgetary constraints.</p></li>
<li><p>The 2011 Budget Control Act, enacted to reduce federal spending, mandated $1 trillion in defense cuts over a decade, triggering a scramble for resources within the defense establishment.</p>
<ul>
<li>This resulted in a prioritization of short-term needs and legacy programs over long-term modernization and innovation.</li>
<li>The military continued to receive more missions but not the resources to effectively execute them or prepare for future challenges.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>On February 27, 2014, <strong>“little green men,”</strong> masked soldiers in unmarked green uniforms, began seizing control of strategic locations in Crimea, Ukraine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Speculation immediately arose that these were Russian special forces, a notion initially downplayed by U.S. officials.</li>
<li>This event caught the U.S. government off guard, despite indications of Russian military movements into Crimea.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The “little green men” swiftly took control of Crimea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seizing control of key infrastructure.</li>
<li>Blockading Ukrainian military forces.</li>
<li>Sealing off the peninsula from the rest of Ukraine.</li>
<li>Forcing the evacuation of 25,000 Ukrainian troops.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On March 21, 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, marking the first violent change of an international border in Europe since World War II.</p></li>
<li><p>The “little green men” employed advanced military tactics and technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incited and supported Russian-speaking separatist groups.</li>
<li>Utilized sophisticated Russian military systems, including electronic warfare, communications jammers, air defenses, and long-range precision rocket artillery.
<ul>
<li>Much of this technology surpassed the capabilities of the U.S. military.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Examples of Russian military superiority as recounted by Ukrainian commanders:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jamming Ukrainian drones, causing them to crash.</li>
<li>Jamming the fuses on Ukrainian warheads, rendering them inert.</li>
<li>Detecting Ukrainian communications signals and using them to target attacks.</li>
<li>Deploying unmanned spotter drones to identify and target armored vehicles.</li>
<li>Using thermobaric warheads to eliminate Ukrainian troops in bunkers and trenches.</li>
<li>Annihilating Ukrainian troop columns with cluster munitions.</li>
<li><strong>Targeted assassination:</strong> Using intercepted cell phone data to geolocate and eliminate a Ukrainian commander.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Russia’s Actions in Ukraine Demonstrated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The emergence of a <strong>“reconnaissance strike complex,”</strong> a network of sensors and shooters enabling rapid and lethal targeting.</li>

<ul>
<li>Jammed communications.</li>
<li>Advanced anti-aircraft missile batteries.</li>
<li>Aggressive maneuvers by Russian warships and submarines.</li>
<li>The use of cruise missiles in close proximity to U.S. Navy ships.</li>

<ul>
<li>Violation of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty with the deployment of ground-launched cruise missiles capable of reaching Europe.</li>
<li>Snap military movements near NATO borders, raising concerns about potential aggression.</li>
<li>Threats of nuclear escalation to deter U.S. intervention.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Analysis of Russia’s Military Capabilities:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In 2016, RAND Corporation analysts David Shlapek and Michael Johnson predicted that Russian forces could reach the capitals of all three Baltic states within 60 hours, overwhelming NATO defenses.</li>
<li>This analysis highlighted the growing concern within the U.S. Department of Defense and Congress that the U.S. military was unprepared for a potential conflict with Russia and could potentially lose.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Factors Contributing to U.S. Military Weakness:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Withdrawal of combat power from Europe to support operations in the Middle East.</li>

<li>This optimism led to U.S. assistance for Russia’s transition, including support for nuclear security and integration into global institutions like the G8 and World Trade Organization.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Divergent Interests:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Despite U.S. efforts, Russia prioritized restoring its great power status over partnership with the West.</li>
<li>Conflicts like Kosovo and Iraq exposed the power imbalance between the two nations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Putin’s Rise and Resurgence:</strong>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="eisenhowers-approach-picking-winners">Eisenhower’s Approach: Picking Winners</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>President Eisenhower’s Philosophy:</strong> Concentrate resources and empower exceptional individuals (“<strong>founders</strong>”) to develop critical military technologies.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> General Bernard Schriever and the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).
<ul>
<li>Schriever was given broad authority, ample funding, and protection from bureaucratic interference.</li>
<li>His team successfully developed ICBMs, laying the groundwork for space exploration, in just five years.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Other “Founders” and their Achievements:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edward Teller:</strong> Developed the hydrogen bomb.</li>
<li><strong>Admiral Hyman Rickover:</strong> Developed miniaturized nuclear reactors for submarines.</li>
<li><strong>Kelly Johnson:</strong> Developed advanced aircraft, including the SR-71 Blackbird.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Prioritizing Speed and Results:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Efficiency and cost-effectiveness were secondary to rapid development and fielding of advanced weapons.</li>
<li>This approach was accepted as the price of staying ahead in the Cold War.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Silicon Valley’s Origins:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Defense contracts during and after World War II transformed Silicon Valley from an agricultural region into a hub of electronics and technology innovation.</li>
<li>This military funding fueled the development of technologies like mainframes, microprocessors, and the internet.</li>
<li>Early Silicon Valley embraced working on military technologies, driven by the challenges and the belief in contributing to national security.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nvidia-and-the-power-of-edge-computing">NVIDIA and the Power of Edge Computing</h4>
<ul>
<li>In 2018, executives from NVIDIA, a computing company, visited the Senate to discuss their partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory.</li>
<li>They had built the world’s fastest supercomputer, capable of performing 200 quadrillion operations per second using NVIDIA’s <strong>graphics processing units (GPUs)</strong>.
<ul>
<li><strong>GPUs</strong> were originally designed for video games, which demanded increasingly powerful computing capabilities.</li>
<li>NVIDIA realized that the same technology powering artificial worlds in games could also power intelligent machines in the real world, particularly in <strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NVIDIA’s GPUs are now crucial for self-driving vehicles.
<ul>
<li>Their Drive AGX Pegasus chip, the size of a textbook, can conduct 320 trillion operations per second, enabling real-time data processing and interpretation on board the vehicle – a concept known as <strong>edge computing</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite the military applications of their technology, NVIDIA had no GPUs operating on fielded U.S. military systems at the time.
<ul>
<li>This highlights a significant technological gap between the U.S. military and commercial technology companies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The most capable computer in a U.S. military system at the time was in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, nicknamed the “Flying Supercomputer.”
<ul>
<li>It could perform 400 billion operations per second, significantly less than NVIDIA’s Drive AGX Pegasus.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-new-global-arms-race-beyond-conventional-weapons">A New Global Arms Race: Beyond Conventional Weapons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Representatives from over 80 countries have been discussing a ban on <strong>lethal autonomous weapons</strong> since 2014.
<ul>
<li><strong>Lethal autonomous weapons:</strong> Defined by the Department of Defense as machines activated to select and engage targets without human intervention.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These weapons, often called “<strong>killer robots</strong>” by opponents, raise ethical concerns about removing humans from the kill chain.
<ul>
<li><strong>Kill chain:</strong> The process of identifying, targeting, and engaging an enemy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While China supports banning the <em>use</em> of these weapons, it has not committed to halting their <em>development</em>.
<ul>
<li>China’s definition of lethal autonomous weapons is narrow and does not encompass the full range of systems it’s developing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This discrepancy highlights a broader trend of rapidly developing military technologies, sparking fears of a global arms race encompassing:
<ul>
<li>Cyber weapons</li>
<li>AI</li>
<li>Hypersonic technology</li>
<li>5G networks</li>
<li>Quantum computing</li>
<li>Gene editing</li>
<li>Space capabilities</li>
</ul></li>
<li>China’s role in this arms race is particularly concerning due to:
<ul>
<li>Significant economic and military power</li>
<li>Less transparent intentions compared to other nations</li>
<li>A potential ambition to reshape the world order in favor of its illiberal values, including authoritarianism, crony capitalism, and surveillance states.</li>
<li>The perception of the United States as an obstacle to its ambitions.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-ethical-dilemma-of-intelligent-machines-in-war">The Ethical Dilemma of Intelligent Machines in War</h3>
<ul>
<li>The author recounts a poignant encounter with a Syrian mother who lost all five of her children in a barrel bomb attack, an experience that deeply affected both him and the late Senator John McCain.
<ul>
<li>This encounter underscores the profound human cost of war and serves as a stark reminder of the ethical considerations surrounding the use of force.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author grapples with the question of whether, as a potential civilian caught in a conflict, the knowledge of whether the weapon systems targeting him were operated by humans or machines would matter.
<ul>
<li>This question highlights a fundamental debate about the ethics of war in the age of intelligent machines:
<ul>
<li><strong>Is the morality of an action determined by the nature of the actor, or by the consequences of the action itself?</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author argues that the current debate about intelligent machines in war often misses the mark by focusing on the wrong questions.
<ul>
<li>He suggests that instead of fixating on the means of warfare (e.g., “killer robots”), we should prioritize the ends (i.e., the ethical use of force) and the principles of human accountability that should govern them.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-importance-of-command-and-control">The Importance of Command and Control</h3>
<ul>
<li>The author criticizes the term “human-machine teaming” often used to describe the relationship between humans and intelligent machines in a military context.
<ul>
<li>He argues that this term implies a false equivalence between human operators and machines.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Instead, the author advocates for the concept of <strong>“human command and machine control,”</strong> emphasizing the hierarchical nature of the relationship where humans retain ultimate authority and responsibility.
<ul>
<li>This concept aligns with the long-standing military principles of command and control, ensuring that human judgment and ethics remain central to the use of force.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author acknowledges the concerns surrounding the potential for machines to act unethically.
<ul>
<li>However, he argues that humans have always exhibited a capacity for cruelty and that focusing solely on the perceived inhumanity of machines ignores the historical reality of human fallibility in war.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author emphasizes that the current debate should center around <strong>narrow artificial intelligence</strong> (AI), which is limited to performing specific tasks, rather than <strong>artificial general intelligence (AGI)</strong> or <strong>superintelligence</strong>, which remain speculative concepts.
<ul>
<li>He underscores that narrow AI, despite its capabilities, operates within the boundaries defined by its human creators.</li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Autonomy</strong> in the context of machines, the author clarifies, does not imply independent decision-making but rather the delegation of tasks within predefined parameters set by humans.</p>
<ul>
<li>This concept mirrors the existing military practice of granting autonomy to human subordinates, albeit with clear rules of engagement and accountability mechanisms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The author proposes a framework for building trust in intelligent machines, drawing parallels to the trust established between human commanders and their subordinates. This framework rests on three pillars:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Training:</strong> Rigorous training of machines to perform designated tasks effectively and ethically.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Testing:</strong> Repeated testing to ensure the machine’s reliability, predictability, and adherence to established parameters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trust:</strong> Trust is earned through consistent demonstration of competence and reliability in training and testing, leading to greater confidence in the machine’s ability to perform as intended.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The author underscores that accountability remains paramount. Just as commanders are responsible for the actions of their human subordinates, they would bear the responsibility for the actions of the machines under their command.</p>
<ul>
<li>This accountability extends to the entire chain of command, including those involved in training, testing, and deploying the intelligent machines.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="differentiating-roles-leveraging-human-judgment">Differentiating Roles: Leveraging Human Judgment</h3>
<ul>
<li>The author argues that one of the potential benefits of increased reliance on intelligent machines is the opportunity to free human operators from mundane and repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on more complex and ethically demanding aspects of warfare.
<ul>
<li>This shift could lead to a more ethical use of force by allowing humans to leverage their unique capacity for judgment, empathy, and moral reasoning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author acknowledges that current intelligent machines might outperform humans in certain tasks, particularly those requiring speed, accuracy, and consistency in data analysis and pattern recognition.
<ul>
<li>However, he stresses that machines should not be seen as replacements for human judgment in all instances.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author contends that while machines can enhance human decision-making by providing valuable insights and recommendations, the ultimate responsibility for decisions, especially those involving the use of lethal force, must remain with human commanders.
<ul>
<li>This approach ensures that human values and ethical considerations remain at the forefront of warfare.</li>

<section id="legal-and-ethical-considerations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="legal-and-ethical-considerations">Legal and Ethical Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The author argues that contrary to popular narratives, lethal autonomous weapons systems are not inherently illegal. He outlines the established legal criteria for determining the legality of a weapon:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Discrimination:</strong> The weapon should be capable of distinguishing between combatants and civilians.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proportionality:</strong> The use of the weapon should be proportionate to the military objective, minimizing unnecessary civilian harm.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Controllability:</strong> The effects of the weapon should be controllable, preventing unintended and widespread harm.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The author emphasizes that the legality of a weapon hinges on its inherent design and intended effects, not on the autonomy of the actor deploying it.</p>
<ul>
<li>He suggests that focusing solely on the “autonomy” of a weapon system misses the critical point that even autonomous weapons operate within the parameters defined by their human creators.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The author acknowledges the potential for errors and unintended consequences, even with highly intelligent machines.</p>

<ul>
<li>The author argues that the U.S. military’s current battle networks, designed around human operators, suffer from significant limitations:
<ul>
<li><strong>Information silos:</strong> Systems often struggle to share information seamlessly, leading to delays and inefficiencies in decision-making.</li>
<li><strong>Linear and rigid structures:</strong> Current networks often operate in predetermined ways, making them inflexible and vulnerable to disruption.</li>
<li><strong>High manpower requirements:</strong> Operating and maintaining complex systems require significant human resources.</li>
<li><strong>Slow decision-making:</strong> The human-centric nature of current systems slows down the speed at which information is processed and acted upon.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These limitations are contrasted with the advancements in the commercial technology sector, particularly in developing the Internet of Things (IoT).</li>
<li>The IoT demonstrates the power of networked systems to share information seamlessly, enabling rapid decision-making and automated processes.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="jan-blochs-predictions-and-their-implications-today">Jan Bloch’s Predictions and Their Implications Today</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jan Bloch</strong>, a Polish banker and military scholar, published a book in 1898 predicting how technology would transform warfare.
<ul>
<li>He accurately foresaw the lethality of modern battlefields due to technological advancements like:
<ul>
<li><strong>Machine guns</strong></li>
<li><strong>Smokeless gunpowder:</strong> This innovation would “lift the fog of war,” leaving armies exposed after initial volleys.</li>
<li><strong>Long-range artillery:</strong> Bloch calculated these were 116 times deadlier than those used a few decades prior.</li>
<li><strong>Improved rifles:</strong> Offering greater speed, accuracy, and range.</li>
<li>Other innovations: Including <strong>railroads, telegraphs, and steamships</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bloch believed this increase in lethality would make large-scale wars “impossible.”</li>
<li>However, World War I proved him wrong, though the conflict unfolded largely as he predicted, with trench warfare and high casualties (40 million deaths in four years).</li>

<ul>
<li>The post-Cold War era, characterized by American dominance, allowed the U.S. to pursue expansive global goals.
<ul>
<li>This period was an anomaly in history, where great power competition is the norm.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The return of great power competition, particularly with China, necessitates a reassessment of U.S. goals and a return to prioritizing core interests.
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Interests</strong>: Those interests deemed so vital to a nation’s security, prosperity, and values that it is prepared to defend them with military force.</li>

<p>This chapter argues that the U.S. defense establishment needs significant change to adapt to future challenges. The author uses the case study of the JSTARS program and draws parallels to historical examples like the adoption of aircraft carriers and ICBMs to illustrate the need for a new approach. The chapter focuses on two key elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incentives:</strong> Rewarding innovation, agility, and the development of technologies that address future threats.</li>
<li><strong>Imagination:</strong> Moving beyond traditional platforms and doctrines to embrace new ways of warfare and leverage emerging technologies.</li>

</section>
<section id="case-study-the-jstars-program" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="case-study-the-jstars-program">Case Study: The JSTARS Program</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Problem:</strong> The Air Force’s plan to replace the aging JSTARS aircraft, a vital intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platform, with a new version of the same aircraft.
<ul>
<li>This plan was flawed because the new JSTARS would be vulnerable to attacks from advanced adversaries like China and Russia.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Solution:</strong> The Air Force proposed disaggregating JSTARS’s capabilities, distributing them across a network of unmanned aircraft and satellites. This approach offered greater resilience and survivability.</li>
<li><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Powerful members of Congress and defense contractors who stood to benefit from the continued production of the traditional JSTARS aircraft opposed the Air Force’s plan.</li>
<li><strong>The Success:</strong> The Air Force’s success in shifting to the new program stemmed from several factors:
<ul>
<li><strong>Political Strategy:</strong> Early and candid engagement with key stakeholders in Congress.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Providing detailed information about the threat to JSTARS and the advantages of the new program.</li>
<li><strong>Industry Engagement:</strong> Informing defense companies about the new plan, enabling them to lobby Congress.</li>
<li><strong>Compromise:</strong> Basing elements of the future program in the same state that would have hosted JSTARS, securing support from potential opponents.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Even good ideas require political maneuvering and strategic compromise to succeed within the existing defense system.</li>

<li><strong>Obstacles:</strong> The U.S. defense establishment faces significant obstacles to change, including:
<ul>
<li><strong>Parochial Military Services:</strong> Prioritizing their own interests over joint solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Interested Companies:</strong> Focusing on profits and protecting existing programs.</li>
<li><strong>Distracted Political Leaders:</strong> Lacking focus on long-term defense planning and more concerned with short-term political gains.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Imperative:</strong> To prepare for future threats, the U.S. must restructure its defense incentives to favor:
<ul>
<li><strong>Networked Kill Chains:</strong> Over legacy platforms.</li>
<li><strong>New Ways of War:</strong> Over familiar doctrines.</li>
<li><strong>Defense:</strong> Over offense.</li>
<li><strong>Future Needs:</strong> Over present requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Software:</strong> Over hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid Capability Development:</strong> Over acquisition compliance and cost accounting.</li>
<li><strong>Technological Diversity:</strong> Over reliance on traditional defense contractors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Mechanism:</strong> Achieving this shift necessitates:
<ul>
<li><strong>Leadership Ownership:</strong> Senior leaders in the Department of Defense and Congress must champion and drive change.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> A partnership between the Pentagon and Congress to establish shared expectations and present a unified front to stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Vision:</strong> Recognizing that transforming the military is a multi-year process requiring sustained commitment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Defining the Problems:</strong> Translating vague concepts into actionable operational problems, such as:
<ul>
<li><strong>Denying China Military Dominance:</strong> Specifically, developing the capability to neutralize 350 Chinese ships within the first three days of a conflict, a challenge requiring advanced ISR, real-time information sharing, and rapid decision-making.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shifting the Paradigm:</strong> Moving away from traditional requirements and budget processes towards:
<ul>
<li><strong>Mission-Focused Competitions:</strong> Allocating significant funding to real-world competitions that identify the best solutions to specific operational challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Rewarding Winners:</strong> Providing substantial funding and fielding opportunities to the winners of these competitions, regardless of their affiliation (military service, established company, or startup).</li>
<li><strong>Embracing Rivalry:</strong> Leveraging the inherent rivalries between military branches and companies to drive innovation and accelerate the development of effective solutions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Transitioning Incrementally:</strong> Acknowledging that the shift from legacy platforms to future technologies will be gradual:
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Enhancement:</strong> New technologies will initially enhance existing platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Gradual Replacement:</strong> Over time, new technologies may replace legacy systems entirely.</li>
<li><strong>Mission Adaptation:</strong> Traditional platforms may find new roles, such as homeland defense, as their relevance in high-intensity conflicts diminishes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Power of Demonstration:</strong> Showing, not just telling, to build support for change:
<ul>
<li><strong>Deterrence through Demonstration:</strong> Convincing adversaries of U.S. military capabilities by showcasing new technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Domestic Persuasion:</strong> Demonstrating the effectiveness of new solutions to skeptical military leaders and policymakers to build domestic political support.</li>

<li><strong>The Problem:</strong> A lack of private investment in defense technology due to:
<ul>
<li><strong>Perceived Risk:</strong> The defense sector is viewed as a risky investment with a high failure rate for new technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Government Commitment:</strong> The government often fails to purchase promising technologies at scale, discouraging private investment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Solution:</strong> Creating incentives for private investment by:
<ul>
<li><strong>Picking Winners:</strong> Identifying and investing heavily in companies developing essential technologies like AI and autonomous systems.</li>
<li><strong>Clear Signals:</strong> Sending strong signals to the market about the government’s commitment to purchasing these technologies in large quantities.</li>
<li><strong>Multiplier Effect:</strong> Large government contracts will attract significantly more private investment, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation and growth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rethinking Earmarks:</strong> Reconsidering the ban on congressional earmarks, with safeguards for transparency and accountability, to enable Congress to directly fund promising defense technologies.</li>
<li><strong>The Importance of Lobbying:</strong> Encouraging companies developing future-oriented military capabilities to actively lobby for their programs and secure political support.<br>
