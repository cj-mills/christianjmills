<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>“The Kill Chain: Defending America in the Future of High-Tech Warfare” by Christian Brose outlines the urgent challenges facing the U.S. military in maintaining its technological and strategic advantage, particularly against China. Brose, a former advisor to Senator John McCain, emphasizes the necessity for the U.S. to adapt its military strategies, technologies, and operations to counter rapidly evolving threats and leverage new technological advancements.</p>
<p>The book details the systemic issues within the U.S. defense establishment that hinder adaptation and innovation, arguing for a comprehensive reimagining of American military power focused on dynamic, efficient kill chains rather than traditional platform-centric approaches.</p>
<p>Through personal anecdotes and professional insights, Brose advocates for a shift towards more autonomous, distributed, and technology-driven military capabilities to ensure America’s security and strategic dominance in the future.</p>
