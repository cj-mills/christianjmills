## Introduction

### Playing a Losing Game

* This book argues that the U.S. military is on a path to lose a future war against China, and that this trajectory must be changed.

* The author, Christian Brose, draws on his extensive experience as a national security and military advisor, most notably serving as staff director for Senator John McCain on the Senate Armed Services Committee. 

* This role provided Brose with access to classified information, top defense officials, and insights into the concerning reality of the U.S. military's eroding advantage over China.

#### A Stark Warning Ignored

*  In 2017, Brose witnessed Senator McCain's attempt to warn his Senate colleagues about the U.S. military's vulnerabilities against China. 
   * McCain, troubled by the military's lagging technological advancement, organized a classified briefing for all 100 senators. 
   * The briefing, based on concerning war game simulations, revealed a bleak outlook: the U.S. consistently lost in simulated conflicts with China. 
   * Despite the gravity of the situation, only a dozen senators attended.

#### A Grim Assessment of U.S. Capabilities

*  **David Ochmanek**, a former Pentagon official, has conducted extensive war game simulations for the Department of Defense, revealing a disturbing pattern:
   * **War Game Outcomes:** The U.S. military consistently loses against China and Russia in these simulations, suffering heavy casualties and equipment losses while failing to achieve objectives. 
   * **A Shocking Reality:** This finding contradicts the prevailing assumption of U.S. military dominance, leaving many within the defense establishment in disbelief. 

*  **A Consistent Pattern of Defeat:** War game simulations over the past decade consistently show the U.S. losing against China. 
   * **A Well-Kept Secret:** This information remains largely unknown to the American public and even many members of Congress, despite being acknowledged within the Department of Defense.

#### A Conversation with Senator McCain: Imagining a War with China

*  Following the poorly attended Senate briefing, Brose and Senator McCain engaged in a sobering thought experiment: imagining a potential war with China.
   *  They agreed that the U.S. would not instigate a conflict, but acknowledged potential triggers such as:
      * A maritime incident escalating into conflict.
      * A Chinese attack on a U.S. ally prompting American intervention.
   *  They envisioned a scenario where the U.S. would face significant challenges in mobilizing and deploying forces.

####  A Potential War With China: Key Vulnerabilities and Challenges

* **Geographical Disadvantages and Logistical Nightmares:**
  *  Much of the U.S. military's necessary equipment and personnel would be positioned thousands of miles away from the conflict zone.
  *  Mobilization efforts would be hampered by cyberattacks and attacks on vulnerable supply lines, including cargo ships and aircraft.

* **Space and Cyber Warfare Dominance by China:**
  * China would leverage its capabilities to target U.S. satellites, disrupting critical intelligence, communication, and GPS systems.
  * Command and control networks would be crippled by electronic, cyber, and missile attacks, leaving U.S. forces in disarray.

* **Vulnerability of Forward Bases and Critical Infrastructure:**
  * U.S. bases in Japan and Guam would be overwhelmed by barrages of Chinese ballistic and cruise missiles.
  * China's hypersonic weapons, capable of maneuvering at high speeds, would render existing U.S. defenses useless. 
  * Runways, operation centers, and fuel depots would be targeted, crippling U.S. operations and forcing evacuations.

* **Limitations of Air and Sea Power:**
  * Older, non-stealthy fighter jets (F-15s, F-16s, F-18s) would be ineffective against China's advanced air defenses.
  * Limited numbers of stealthy fighter jets (F-22s, F-35s) would be hampered by their short range and dependence on vulnerable aerial refueling tankers.
  * U.S. aircraft carriers would be forced to operate far from Chinese shores to avoid anti-ship missiles, limiting their effectiveness and making them vulnerable to attack.
  * China's "carrier killer" missiles (DF-21 and DF-26) would pose a significant threat, potentially sinking carriers and causing massive casualties.

* **Challenges for the Marine Corps and Amphibious Operations:**
  *  The Marine Corps' amphibious assault capabilities, designed for beach landings, would be largely ineffective against heavily defended Chinese territory.
  *  The need to operate within range of Chinese missiles would severely restrict their ability to conduct traditional amphibious operations.

* **Logistical Constraints and Depletion of Critical Assets:**
  * Key U.S. assets (submarines, long-range bombers, ground-launched missiles) would need to be relocated to the Pacific, taking crucial time.
  * Years of underinvestment and acquisition delays would result in a shortage of these assets and a rapid depletion of essential weapons.

#### A Sobering Realization: Facing the Consequences

* **Devastation and Defeat:** Brose and McCain contemplated the potential human and material costs of such a war, including thousands of American casualties, sunken ships, destroyed bases, and a swift defeat.

* **Unthinkable Choices:** The potential for such a rapid and devastating loss would present a U.S. president with limited options, potentially including surrender or a futile fight.

* **China's Strategic Advantage:** This outcome would fulfill China's strategic objective of achieving victory without engaging in protracted warfare, as outlined in Sun Tzu's "The Art of War."

#### A Legacy of Neglect: Failing to Address the Challenge

*  McCain expressed frustration and disappointment that despite past warnings and efforts to address military weaknesses, the U.S. found itself in a precarious position.
   * The 1980s revelation of a "hollow force" sparked outrage and action, yet the current crisis, despite being more dire, had not elicited a similar response.
   * McCain lamented the lack of awareness and urgency among both the public and elected officials, fearing future generations would judge them harshly for their inaction.

### The Illusion of American Military Supremacy: Mistaking Inputs for Outcomes

*  Despite spending more on defense than any other country, the U.S. military faces an existential crisis, challenging the prevailing notion of its invincibility.
   *  This discrepancy between spending and effectiveness highlights a fundamental flaw in how the U.S. approaches national defense.

*  **The Problem with Platforms:**
   *  The U.S. military's traditional focus on platforms (e.g., ships, planes, tanks) as the primary measure of strength is misguided.
   *  Platforms are seen as tangible symbols of military might, influencing budgets, capabilities, and even institutional identity.

*  **The Importance of the Kill Chain:**
   *  **Defining the Kill Chain:**
      *  The kill chain is the essential process by which militaries achieve their objectives, involving three key steps:
         * **Understanding:** Gathering information about the battlespace and the enemy.
         * **Deciding:**  Analyzing information and making strategic and tactical decisions.
         * **Acting:**  Executing decisions to achieve desired effects, which may or may not involve lethal force.
   *  **Closing and Breaking the Kill Chain:**
      *  **Closing the Kill Chain:**  Successfully completing the understand-decide-act cycle to achieve a military objective.
      *  **Breaking the Kill Chain:**  Disrupting an adversary's ability to complete the kill chain, neutralizing their effectiveness. 
   *  **A Universal Concept:**
      *  The kill chain is not unique to the military; it mirrors processes used in business, sports, and everyday life.
      *  This framework highlights that while the military operates in a unique and high-stakes environment, its core functions are relatable and understandable.

*  **The Information Revolution and Its Unfulfilled Promise:**
   *  The information revolution of the 1980s promised to revolutionize warfare by enabling networked warfare and the disaggregation of the kill chain across multiple platforms.
   *  However, the U.S. defense establishment failed to fully embrace this transformation, clinging to its platform-centric approach.

*  **The Failure to Adapt:**
   *  Despite advancements in information technology, the U.S. military's kill chain remains slow, inflexible, and reliant on outdated systems. 
   *  Military platforms often lack interoperability, hindering their ability to share information and function as a cohesive network.

*  **The Legacy of Failed Modernization:**
   * Previous attempts to modernize the military often focused on developing better versions of existing platforms using unproven technologies, resulting in costly procurement failures.
   * The U.S. military's current predicament is partly a result of learning the wrong lessons from these failures, leading to risk aversion and a reluctance to embrace truly transformative change.

### The China Challenge: A New Era of Competition

* **A Rapidly Evolving Threat:**
  *  The information revolution is accelerating, driven by commercial technology companies, and these advancements have significant military applications.
  *  China, capitalizing on these emerging technologies, poses a rapidly growing and evolving threat to U.S. military dominance.

* **China's Strategic Approach:**
  *  China has meticulously studied the U.S. military, identifying its weaknesses and developing strategies to exploit them.
  *  Instead of directly confronting U.S. strengths, China aims to deny the U.S. military the ability to project power and fight in its preferred manner. 

* **Asymmetric Warfare and Technological Leapfrogging:**
  *  China has invested heavily in advanced weapons designed to disrupt U.S. battle networks, destroy expensive platforms, and break the kill chain. 
  *  This approach prioritizes achieving a decisive advantage through technological superiority and asymmetric capabilities.

* **The Rise of China: Economic and Military Power:**
  *  China's economic growth fuels its military ambitions, potentially enabling it to match or surpass U.S. military spending within a decade.
  *  This shift in the balance of power poses an unprecedented challenge, demanding a fundamental reassessment of U.S. defense strategy.

* **China's Grand Strategy:**
  *  China's ambitions extend beyond regional dominance to becoming the world's leading power, supplanting the United States. 
  *  This strategy entails undermining U.S. influence globally, eroding its alliances, and promoting China's model of authoritarianism.

* **Exploiting Emerging Technologies:**
  *  China recognizes the transformative potential of emerging technologies and is investing heavily in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, robotics, and other fields. 
  *  These technologies are not only being used to enhance its military but also to strengthen its authoritarian control domestically.

* **A Looming Crisis for the U.S. Military:**
  *  The U.S. military's current trajectory puts it at a severe disadvantage against China's asymmetric capabilities. 
  *  Continuing to invest in the same platforms and approaches will only exacerbate this vulnerability, playing into China's hands.

### The Need for Transformation: Reimagining American Military Power

* **Recognizing the Urgency:**
  *  The U.S. defense establishment must acknowledge the severity of the situation and the need for radical change.
  *  Complacency and clinging to outdated paradigms will result in catastrophic consequences for U.S. security and global standing.

* **Shifting from Inputs to Outcomes:**
  * The focus should shift from simply acquiring platforms to building a more effective kill chain.
  * This requires prioritizing technologies and capabilities that enhance the U.S. military's ability to understand, decide, and act faster and more effectively than its competitors.

* **From Platforms to Networks:**
  *  Instead of relying on small numbers of expensive and vulnerable platforms, the U.S. military must adopt a more networked and distributed approach. 
  *  This entails investing in:
     *  **Interoperable Systems:** Enabling seamless communication and data sharing between platforms.
     *  **Resilient Networks:** Developing robust networks that can withstand attacks and disruptions.
     *  **Artificial Intelligence:** Leveraging AI for faster and more effective decision-making.

* **From Offensive to Defensive:**
  * The U.S. military must prioritize defensive capabilities that deter Chinese aggression and protect critical assets.
  * This includes:
    * Strengthening base defenses against missile attacks.
    * Developing more effective counter-space and cyber capabilities.
    * Investing in technologies that make U.S. platforms less vulnerable to detection and attack.

* **Embracing Autonomy and Unmanned Systems:**
  *  The U.S. military should accelerate the development and deployment of autonomous and unmanned systems.
  *  This shift would:
     *  Reduce reliance on vulnerable manned platforms.
     *  Increase the speed and tempo of operations.
     *  Enable the U.S. military to operate more effectively in contested environments.

* **Rethinking Force Structure:**
  *  The U.S. military must move away from its traditional force structure of large, heavily manned platforms.
  *  Instead, it should prioritize:
     * Smaller, more agile, and expendable platforms.
     * A greater emphasis on unmanned and autonomous systems.
     * A force that is designed for distributed and networked warfare.

* **Overcoming Institutional Inertia:**
  *  The biggest obstacle to transformation is not a lack of resources or technology but a lack of imagination and institutional inertia.
  *  Overcoming this will require:
     * Strong leadership willing to challenge the status quo.
     * A cultural shift that embraces innovation and change.
     * A willingness to take risks and accept that failure is part of the innovation process.

### Conclusion: A Call to Action

* **The Stakes:**
  *  The future of American security and global leadership hangs in the balance.
  *  Failure to adapt to the changing character of warfare will have dire consequences for the U.S. and its allies. 

* **The Path Forward:**
  * The U.S. must embrace bold and transformative change to maintain its military edge.
  * This requires a fundamental rethinking of defense strategy, force structure, and acquisition processes. 

* **The Role of Informed Citizenry:**
  *  An informed and engaged citizenry is essential for driving the necessary changes in U.S. national defense.
  *  This book aims to educate the public about the challenges and opportunities presented by emerging technologies and the future of warfare, encouraging a national conversation about the best way to defend America in the 21st century. 





## Chapter 1: What Happened to Yoda's Revolution?

### The Dawn of a New Era and the Seeds of Complacency (1991-2001)

#### A Visionary's Warning: Andrew Marshall and the Future of War

* In 1991, amidst the backdrop of the Cold War's end, Andrew Marshall, director of the Office of Net Assessment (ONA), initiated a project to assess the future of warfare.
  * **Andrew Marshall**, often referred to as "Yoda," held this influential position for 42 years, reporting directly to the Secretary of Defense.
  * The ONA's primary mission was to evaluate the United States' strategic standing against its competitors, mainly the Soviet Union.

* Marshall, aided by Army Colonel Andrew Krepenevich, aimed to analyze the impact of emerging technologies and the Soviet Union's collapse on international security and the U.S.'s role.
* This project became particularly relevant after the U.S. waged war against Iraq in response to the invasion of Kuwait, a conflict heavily shaped by Cold War strategies and military structures.

#### The Gulf War Illusion: A Misleading Victory

* The Gulf War (1991) unfolded as a demonstration of American military might, leaving a lasting impression on a young generation.
  * The conflict showcased technological advancements like stealth bombers, smart bombs, and superior air and ground power. 
  * The U.S. achieved a swift victory with minimal casualties (129 combat deaths).

* Despite the perceived success, Marshall's 1992 report to the Secretary of Defense offered a different perspective.
  * He highlighted the influence of classified Soviet military writings that predicted a "**military technical revolution**." 
    * This revolution, termed the "**reconnaissance strike complex,**" proposed that advanced sensors and surveillance technologies, coupled with precision weaponry, would create the fastest, most effective kill chain in history.
  * While the Soviets saw the Gulf War as a testament to this concept, Marshall argued that the U.S. hadn't even come close to achieving its full potential in this area.

* A 1993 Pentagon study supported Marshall's assessment.
  * The study revealed that the U.S. battle network remained largely unchanged since the Vietnam era.
  * It struggled to engage moving targets and relied heavily on "dumb bombs" instead of "smart" ones.

* Admiral William Owens, future Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, later stated that the Gulf War was primarily won through "massed brute force," akin to historical campaigns.

#### A Revolution in Military Affairs: The Need for Transformation

* Marshall envisioned a **revolution in military affairs (RMA),** driven by information technologies.
  * He cited historical examples of RMAs, such as the introduction of machine guns, steam-powered ships, and airplanes, emphasizing that technological advancements alone were insufficient.
  * Successful RMAs required developing new operational strategies and reforming existing military institutions for new strategic goals. 

* Marshall warned that the U.S. was in the early stages of such a revolution, one that could last for decades.
  * This RMA would center around information technologies that enhance understanding, decision-making, and action in war.
  * It would necessitate a shift in the concept of military power, potentially rendering traditional platforms like tanks, manned aircraft, and large ships less effective.
  * Marshall cautioned that failure to adapt to this RMA would leave the U.S. vulnerable to adversaries who successfully harnessed its potential.

* Marshall's analysts coined the term "**anti-access and area denial capabilities**" to describe how powerful adversaries could leverage this RMA to counter the U.S.'s platform-centric approach.

* Despite its prescience, Marshall's report failed to instigate significant change.
  * The U.S., after the Soviet Union's collapse, found itself in a unipolar world, with no immediate peer competitors.
  * This led to a sense of complacency, with leaders prioritizing a "peace dividend" by downsizing the military and focusing on peacekeeping and humanitarian missions.
  * The prevailing assumption was that future conflicts would resemble the Gulf War, fought against technologically inferior adversaries, allowing the U.S. to dictate the terms of engagement.

#### The Allure of Technology and the Lack of Urgency 

* Despite the lack of substantial change, the concept of RMA gained traction in Washington during the 1990s, driven by the fascination with the burgeoning information age.
  * "Revolution" and "transformation" became buzzwords, leading to numerous initiatives aimed at reimagining the U.S. military.
    * These initiatives included projects like "Army After Next," "Network-Centric Warfare," "Joint Vision 2010," and "Lifting the Fog of War."
  * The 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review, the Pentagon's key strategy document, explicitly prioritized exploiting the RMA.

* However, despite the rhetoric and investments in defense technology, the U.S.'s way of fighting remained largely unchanged.
  * The interventions in Bosnia (1995) and Kosovo (1999) further reinforced this complacency.
    * These conflicts, won with minimal U.S. casualties (four non-combat deaths), were attributed more to adversary weakness than any significant U.S. transformation.

* Admiral Owens, after retiring, criticized the military's "residual overconfidence" and its tendency to draw the wrong lessons from the Gulf War.
  * He warned that without genuine adaptation, the U.S. risked a decline in military strength and capabilities in the coming decades as Cold War-era equipment became obsolete.

#### The 20XX War Games: A Glimpse into a Challenging Future

* As the 21st century began, Marshall, recognizing the lack of progress, initiated the "**Future Warfare 20XX war game series**."
  * These war games aimed to simulate future conflicts in a world where the RMA had reached maturity, pitting the U.S. against a hypothetical "large peer competitor" – implicitly China.

* The war games were led by Robert Martinage and Michael Vickers, both future senior Pentagon officials.

* Their 2001 report presented a stark assessment:
  * China, by 2025-2030, would possess advanced technologies comparable to the U.S., enabling it to target U.S. assets globally, including the homeland.
  * The U.S.'s reliance on traditional platforms and its vulnerability to attacks on its communication and logistics networks would render its traditional way of fighting ineffective.
  * The report stressed the need to fully embrace the RMA, building technologically advanced, networked forces, especially unmanned systems, to counter these threats.
  * The report warned of an "unforgiving future battlefield" where "if you can be seen, you can be killed."

---

### A Missed Opportunity: The Rumsfeld Era and the War on Terror (2001-2009)

#### A False Dawn: The Promise of Transformation and the Reality of 9/11

* The arrival of Donald Rumsfeld as Secretary of Defense in 2001 initially signaled potential progress.
  * Rumsfeld openly advocated for the RMA and created the Office of Force Transformation to oversee the development of new military technologies and doctrines.
  * He also signed a new defense strategy that prioritized addressing the operational challenges highlighted in Marshall's 20XX war games, shifting focus toward emerging great powers like China.

* However, the 9/11 terrorist attacks drastically altered the strategic landscape, leading to a significant shift in priorities. 
  * While Rumsfeld still emphasized transformation, the focus shifted towards waging a global war on terror.

* The War on Terror did yield some genuine military innovations, primarily within the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC).
  * JSOC developed new technologies and tactics for counterterrorism missions, achieving remarkable speed and effectiveness in dismantling terrorist networks.
  * This innovation, along with the adoption of a counterinsurgency strategy in 2007, played a crucial role in weakening al-Qaeda in Iraq. 

* However, the War on Terror ultimately sidetracked the U.S. from addressing the long-term challenge posed by China. 
  * While the Bush administration claimed that both priorities could be managed simultaneously, the focus on counterterrorism, particularly the protracted conflict in Iraq, consumed the majority of resources and attention.

#### The Persistence of Complacency: Reliving Past Glories 

* Despite claims of transformation, the initial victories in Afghanistan and Iraq were, in essence, repetitions of past successes, achieved against significantly weaker opponents.
  * The U.S. retained its ability to dictate the terms of engagement, operate from secure sanctuaries, and leverage its technological superiority. 

* The core issue remained unchanged: the lack of urgency to embrace genuine transformation. 
  * The perceived ease of these victories reinforced the belief in the U.S.'s military dominance and the validity of its traditional approaches to warfare.
  * Even as the Iraq War deteriorated into a strategic quagmire, the defense establishment largely dismissed it as an anomaly, clinging to outdated assumptions.

* The U.S. continued to invest heavily in traditional military platforms, planning for future conflicts that mirrored those of the past – fought against technologically inferior adversaries on uncontested battlefields.

#### The Real Cost of War: Neglecting the Future 

* A prevailing narrative within the defense establishment argues that the U.S. military's lack of preparedness for future challenges stems from the overwhelming demands of the War on Terror, which consumed its budget and bandwidth. 
  * While the constant operational tempo undoubtedly took a toll, this narrative only tells part of the story. 

* The root cause lies in a failure of imagination and a misallocation of resources. 
  * The U.S. clung to the idea that a persistent global military presence, rather than investing in and showcasing innovative capabilities, would deter adversaries.
  * This strategy, however, led to the overextension and exhaustion of the military, with limited strategic gains.

* Instead of prioritizing the development of faster, more adaptable kill chains through real-world experimentation, the U.S. poured vast sums into attempting to transform existing platforms, often with little success.

* Billions were wasted on numerous modernization programs that were ultimately canceled without yielding any usable capabilities. 
  * Examples include the Army's Future Combat System ($18.1 billion), the Marine Corps' Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle ($3.3 billion), and a host of other projects across all services.

* Even those programs that weren't canceled often faced significant delays, cost overruns, and ultimately failed to deliver the promised "transformational" capabilities.
  * This includes high-profile programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Ford-class aircraft carrier, the KC-46 refueling tanker, and the Littoral Combat Ship, as well as numerous lesser-known systems.
  * Many of these systems were rushed into development before the underlying technologies were mature, leading to persistent problems and escalating costs.

#### A Tower of Babel: The Failure of Interoperability 

* One of the most glaring failures was the lack of interoperability between different military systems, despite the emphasis on information sharing and joint operations. 
  * Systems were often designed with incompatible communication and data-sharing protocols, hindering their ability to function as a cohesive network.

* A prime example is the inability of the F-22 and F-35A fighter jets, both Air Force programs built by the same company, to directly share basic targeting data. 
  * This lack of seamless integration forced reliance on outdated communication methods, such as voice transmissions.

* This issue of interoperability plagued all branches of the military, stemming from a system that incentivized closed, proprietary technologies, benefiting defense contractors while hindering the development of truly integrated kill chains.

#### Stifled Innovation: The Price of Protecting the Past

* While some genuinely revolutionary technologies were explored, they often faced resistance and were ultimately sidelined or abandoned.
  * The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) made progress in areas like artificial intelligence, but these projects rarely transitioned into operational capabilities. 
  * Other initiatives, such as the development of semi-autonomous long-range anti-ship missiles and unmanned combat air vehicles, struggled for funding and were eventually discontinued.

* The Navy's X-47, the first unmanned aerial vehicle capable of launching from and landing on an aircraft carrier, demonstrated remarkable technological prowess but was canceled despite its success.

* This resistance to innovation stemmed from the prioritization of traditional platforms, particularly manned aircraft, which were seen as central to the identity and budget justifications of the military services. 
  * The focus on incremental improvements to these legacy systems, rather than embracing disruptive technologies, hindered the development of truly transformational capabilities. 

#### The Wrong Priorities: Building for the Last War 

* The Pentagon and Congress essentially got military modernization backward, prioritizing incremental upgrades to existing platforms (tanks, manned aircraft, large satellites, and ships) over the development of integrated battle networks. 
  * This approach ignored Marshall's warnings that these legacy systems would become increasingly vulnerable in a future characterized by advanced reconnaissance strike complexes.

* The result was a collection of disparate sensors and weapons systems, lacking seamless interoperability and requiring significant time and effort to function cohesively.

* This outcome was not an accident but rather a consequence of a system that valued platforms over networks and incentivized the preservation of existing structures.

#### The Iraq War: A Death Knell for Transformation

* The Iraq War ultimately dealt a fatal blow to the concept of RMA, but not in the way Rumsfeld initially envisioned.
  * As the conflict dragged on, revealing critical equipment shortages (body armor, blast-resistant vehicles, and unmanned surveillance aircraft) and mounting casualties, the idea of technological transformation became associated with a failure to adequately equip and support troops in the present.

* This fueled a backlash against "revolution," shifting the focus back to conventional warfare and traditional platforms. 
  * By 2008, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates criticized what he termed "next-war-itis," arguing against prioritizing future needs over current demands. 

* In reality, the more pervasive affliction was "last-war-itis" – an overreliance on past successes and a reluctance to adapt to a changing strategic environment.

* The U.S., instead of embracing transformation, doubled down on its existing playbook, prioritizing legacy systems and preparing for conflicts that resembled those it had already fought.

### The Obama Years: A Decade of Drift and Denial (2009-2017)

#### Continuing the Cycle: More Missions, Fewer Resources

* Despite inheriting two wars and a global financial crisis, the Obama administration largely continued the trend of prioritizing present demands over future preparedness.
  * While President Obama campaigned on ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, his tenure saw a continuation of these conflicts and the expansion of military operations into Libya, Yemen, Syria, and elsewhere. 

* Although Obama called for a "pivot to Asia" to counter China's rise, and his administration initiated the "Air-Sea Battle" concept to address China's growing military capabilities in the western Pacific, these efforts were undermined by budgetary constraints.

* The 2011 Budget Control Act, enacted to reduce federal spending, mandated $1 trillion in defense cuts over a decade, triggering a scramble for resources within the defense establishment. 
  * This resulted in a prioritization of short-term needs and legacy programs over long-term modernization and innovation.
  * The military continued to receive more missions but not the resources to effectively execute them or prepare for future challenges.

#### The Tyranny of the Present: Shackled to Outdated Systems

* This constant focus on "current operations" resulted in a military increasingly ill-suited for the evolving character of warfare. 
  * The U.S.'s rigid, manually intensive, and slow-to-adapt kill chains struggled to cope with dynamic targets and complex, multifaceted challenges.

* The underlying technologies underpinning the U.S.'s decision-making and action cycles remained largely static, trapped in "black boxes" that were difficult to upgrade.
  * This reflected a dangerous assumption of perpetual dominance, neglecting the critical need for adaptability and innovation.

#### The Ambush of the Future: 2014 and Beyond

* Andrew Marshall, upon retiring in 2015 after 42 years at the helm of the ONA, witnessed his warnings about the U.S.'s unpreparedness for the future of warfare coming to pass. 

* The annexation of Crimea by Russia in February 2014 marked a turning point, signaling a new era of great power competition and the return of interstate conflict. 

* The U.S., having prioritized the present at the expense of the future, found itself vulnerable to this "ambush by the future." 

* The very technologies and strategies that Marshall had cautioned against decades earlier – anti-access and area denial capabilities, advanced reconnaissance strike complexes, and the exploitation of information dominance – were now being employed by adversaries, rendering the U.S.'s traditional advantages less certain.





## Chapter 2: Little Green Men and Assassin’s Mace

### The Reemergence of Great Power Competition

#### Russia’s Ambush in Ukraine (2014)

* On February 27, 2014, **“little green men,”** masked soldiers in unmarked green uniforms, began seizing control of strategic locations in Crimea, Ukraine.
  * Speculation immediately arose that these were Russian special forces, a notion initially downplayed by U.S. officials.
  * This event caught the U.S. government off guard, despite indications of Russian military movements into Crimea.

* The “little green men” swiftly took control of Crimea:
  * Seizing control of key infrastructure.
  * Blockading Ukrainian military forces.
  * Sealing off the peninsula from the rest of Ukraine.
  * Forcing the evacuation of 25,000 Ukrainian troops.

* On March 21, 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, marking the first violent change of an international border in Europe since World War II.

* The “little green men” employed advanced military tactics and technology:
  * Incited and supported Russian-speaking separatist groups.

## Chapter 7: Human Command, Machine Control

### The Ethical Dilemma of Intelligent Machines in War

* The author recounts a poignant encounter with a Syrian mother who lost all five of her children in a barrel bomb attack, an experience that deeply affected both him and the late Senator John McCain.
  * This encounter underscores the profound human cost of war and serves as a stark reminder of the ethical considerations surrounding the use of force.

* The author grapples with the question of whether, as a potential civilian caught in a conflict, the knowledge of whether the weapon systems targeting him were operated by humans or machines would matter. 
  * This question highlights a fundamental debate about the ethics of war in the age of intelligent machines: 
    * **Is the morality of an action determined by the nature of the actor, or by the consequences of the action itself?**

* The author argues that the current debate about intelligent machines in war often misses the mark by focusing on the wrong questions. 
  * He suggests that instead of fixating on the means of warfare (e.g., "killer robots"), we should prioritize the ends (i.e., the ethical use of force) and the principles of human accountability that should govern them.


### The Importance of Command and Control

* The author criticizes the term "human-machine teaming" often used to describe the relationship between humans and intelligent machines in a military context. 
  * He argues that this term implies a false equivalence between human operators and machines.

* Instead, the author advocates for the concept of **"human command and machine control,"** emphasizing the hierarchical nature of the relationship where humans retain ultimate authority and responsibility. 
  * This concept aligns with the long-standing military principles of command and control, ensuring that human judgment and ethics remain central to the use of force.

* The author acknowledges the concerns surrounding the potential for machines to act unethically. 
  * However, he argues that humans have always exhibited a capacity for cruelty and that focusing solely on the perceived inhumanity of machines ignores the historical reality of human fallibility in war.

* The author emphasizes that the current debate should center around **narrow artificial intelligence** (AI), which is limited to performing specific tasks, rather than **artificial general intelligence (AGI)** or **superintelligence**, which remain speculative concepts. 
  * He underscores that narrow AI, despite its capabilities, operates within the boundaries defined by its human creators.


### Trust, Accountability, and the Limits of Autonomy

* **Autonomy** in the context of machines, the author clarifies, does not imply independent decision-making but rather the delegation of tasks within predefined parameters set by humans. 
  * This concept mirrors the existing military practice of granting autonomy to human subordinates, albeit with clear rules of engagement and accountability mechanisms.

* The author proposes a framework for building trust in intelligent machines, drawing parallels to the trust established between human commanders and their subordinates. This framework rests on three pillars:

  1. **Training:** Rigorous training of machines to perform designated tasks effectively and ethically.

  2. **Testing:** Repeated testing to ensure the machine's reliability, predictability, and adherence to established parameters.

  3. **Trust:** Trust is earned through consistent demonstration of competence and reliability in training and testing, leading to greater confidence in the machine's ability to perform as intended.

* The author underscores that accountability remains paramount. Just as commanders are responsible for the actions of their human subordinates, they would bear the responsibility for the actions of the machines under their command. 
  * This accountability extends to the entire chain of command, including those involved in training, testing, and deploying the intelligent machines.


### Differentiating Roles: Leveraging Human Judgment

* The author argues that one of the potential benefits of increased reliance on intelligent machines is the opportunity to free human operators from mundane and repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on more complex and ethically demanding aspects of warfare. 
  * This shift could lead to a more ethical use of force by allowing humans to leverage their unique capacity for judgment, empathy, and moral reasoning.

* The author acknowledges that current intelligent machines might outperform humans in certain tasks, particularly those requiring speed, accuracy, and consistency in data analysis and pattern recognition. 
  * However, he stresses that machines should not be seen as replacements for human judgment in all instances.

* The author contends that while machines can enhance human decision-making by providing valuable insights and recommendations, the ultimate responsibility for decisions, especially those involving the use of lethal force, must remain with human commanders. 
  * This approach ensures that human values and ethical considerations remain at the forefront of warfare.


### Legal and Ethical Considerations

* The author argues that contrary to popular narratives, lethal autonomous weapons systems are not inherently illegal. He outlines the established legal criteria for determining the legality of a weapon:

  1. **Discrimination:** The weapon should be capable of distinguishing between combatants and civilians.

  2. **Proportionality:** The use of the weapon should be proportionate to the military objective, minimizing unnecessary civilian harm.

  3. **Controllability:** The effects of the weapon should be controllable, preventing unintended and widespread harm.

* The author emphasizes that the legality of a weapon hinges on its inherent design and intended effects, not on the autonomy of the actor deploying it. 
  * He suggests that focusing solely on the "autonomy" of a weapon system misses the critical point that even autonomous weapons operate within the parameters defined by their human creators.

* The author acknowledges the potential for errors and unintended consequences, even with highly intelligent machines. 
  * He argues that transparency, rigorous testing, and clearly defined rules of engagement are crucial for mitigating risks and ensuring accountability.


### The Importance of Transparency and International Cooperation

* The author criticizes the secrecy surrounding the U.S. drone program, arguing that it created a perception of wrongdoing and hampered public understanding of the ethical considerations involved. 
  * He advocates for a more transparent approach to the development and deployment of intelligent machines in warfare.

* The author suggests that the U.S. should lead by example, demonstrating its commitment to ethical development and use of intelligent machines. 
  * He proposes inviting international scrutiny and collaboration to establish norms and standards for the responsible use of these technologies.

* The author acknowledges the challenges of international cooperation, particularly with rivals like China and Russia. 
  * However, he argues that open dialogue and transparency are essential for building trust and establishing a framework for responsible development and use of intelligent machines in warfare. 


### Conclusion: A Reluctant Yes, With Caveats

* The author concludes by advocating for the development of lethal autonomous weapons systems, but with significant caveats. 
  * He argues that the U.S. cannot afford to cede this technological advantage to rivals who may not share its ethical commitments.

* The author draws a parallel to the development of nuclear weapons, suggesting that lethal autonomous weapons should be viewed as a deterrent, intended to prevent their use by adversaries. 
  * He emphasizes that the ultimate goal should be to deter conflict and prevent the use of these weapons altogether.

* The author stresses the importance of transparency, rigorous testing, and clear accountability mechanisms to ensure that these weapons are developed and used ethically and responsibly. 
  * He calls for a national conversation about these technologies, urging Americans to engage in this critical debate and shape the future of warfare. 





## Chapter 8: A Military Internet of Things

  - **Great power competitors**: Nations with significant economic, technological, and military capabilities that can challenge U.S. interests and influence on a global scale.
- This shift was deemed necessary due to America's declining military advantage and the increasing capabilities of China's military.
- McCain stressed the need for prioritization and strategic thinking in the face of finite resources.
- He argued that the new defense strategy presented a crucial opportunity to develop an effective approach to China.

### The Importance of Strategy and Choice

- McCain criticized the misuse of the word "strategy" in Washington, where it often masked the lack of real prioritization. 
- He believed that effective strategies require making hard choices, prioritizing critical goals, and accepting trade-offs.
- This approach stood in contrast to the common practice of creating all-inclusive but ultimately meaningless "laundry lists" of priorities.

### The 2018 National Defense Strategy: A Step in the Right Direction

- The 2018 National Defense Strategy, influenced by McCain's advocacy, marked a positive step towards addressing the challenges of great power competition.
- **Key Strengths:**
  - Clearly identified long-term strategic competition with China and Russia as the top priority for the Department of Defense.
  - Provided detailed guidance for policy and programmatic choices in classified form.
- Despite its strengths, the 2018 strategy was seen as a starting point that required further development and bolder action.

### The Need for a More Radical Shift: Defense Without Dominance

- The author argues that the scale of change required necessitates a move beyond incremental adjustments.
- **Defense without dominance**: A strategic approach that acknowledges the decline of U.S. military superiority and focuses on defending core interests rather than pursuing global dominance.
  - Requires a fundamental shift in mindset, moving away from the offensive, power-projection model that has characterized U.S. military strategy since World War II. 

### Rethinking America's Goals in an Era of Great Power Competition

- The post-Cold War era, characterized by American dominance, allowed the U.S. to pursue expansive global goals.
  - This period was an anomaly in history, where great power competition is the norm.
- The return of great power competition, particularly with China, necessitates a reassessment of U.S. goals and a return to prioritizing core interests.
  - **Core Interests**: Those interests deemed so vital to a nation's security, prosperity, and values that it is prepared to defend them with military force.
- The author argues for a more realistic and focused approach, recognizing that great powers can limit each other's ambitions.

### Denying China Military Dominance: The Primary Objective

- The author contends that preventing Chinese military dominance in Asia should be the overarching objective of U.S. defense strategy.
  - Chinese military dominance could have detrimental consequences for the U.S. and its allies, potentially granting China control over vital economic centers and granting it leverage in international disputes.
- This goal requires prioritizing the Indo-Pacific region and making difficult choices about resource allocation and military deployments.

### Homeland Defense: A New (Old) Imperative

- For the first time since the 19th century, the U.S. faces a credible threat of conventional military attack on its homeland.
  - China's development of long-range precision strike capabilities has made U.S. territory vulnerable.
- This new reality necessitates a significant shift in U.S. defense posture, requiring investments in homeland defense and a reevaluation of the military's role in protecting the U.S. from conventional attack.

### Embracing a Defensive Mindset and a New American Way of War

- The author calls for a shift from an offensive to a defensive mindset, adapting to the challenges posed by China's military capabilities.
- This new approach emphasizes:
  - **Denial:** Preventing adversaries from achieving their objectives by making it too costly or difficult.
  - **Deterrence:** Dissuading adversaries from taking aggressive actions by demonstrating the ability and willingness to inflict unacceptable costs.
- This shift requires a move away from the traditional U.S. military model of power projection and dominance towards a more agile and resilient force structure.

### Building a Different Kind of Military for a Different Kind of War

- The current U.S. military, designed for a different era, is ill-suited to the challenges of great power competition with China.
- **Key Weaknesses:**
  - Reliance on small numbers of expensive, heavily manned, and vulnerable systems.
  - Centralized networks susceptible to disruption.
  - Limited ability to operate effectively in contested environments.
- **Attributes of a Future Force:**
  - **Distributed Systems:** Larger numbers of smaller, more dispersed systems to complicate enemy targeting and enhance survivability.
  - **Expendable Systems:** Lower-cost, easily replaceable systems to mitigate the impact of losses and make it more expensive for adversaries to engage U.S. forces.
  - **Unmanned Systems:** Greater reliance on unmanned systems to reduce risk to human life and operate more effectively in high-threat environments.
  - **Decentralized Networks:** More resilient and adaptable networks that are difficult to disrupt and can continue to function even under attack.
  - **Software-Defined Capabilities:** Greater emphasis on software, artificial intelligence, and autonomous systems to enhance decision-making, speed, and lethality.

### The Importance of Allies: Strength in Partnerships

- The author stresses the critical role of allies in balancing Chinese power and deterring aggression.
- While acknowledging the need for allies to share the burden of defense, the author criticizes the Trump administration's approach to alliances as counterproductive.
- He argues for a more collaborative and mutually beneficial approach, recognizing that allies provide:
  - **Forward Presence:** Access to bases and territory that enhances U.S. military posture and reduces reliance on long-range power projection.
  - **Operational Support:** Contributions to collective defense efforts, increasing overall capability and capacity.
  - **Political and Diplomatic Leverage:** Amplified pressure on adversaries and greater legitimacy for U.S. actions.

### Conclusion: Embracing Change and Reimagining Defense

- The author emphasizes the need for urgent and substantial changes to U.S. defense strategy to adapt to the realities of great power competition with China.
- This requires a shift in mindset, a reassessment of goals, and a willingness to make difficult choices.
- Failure to adapt risks leaving the U.S. vulnerable to Chinese coercion and unable to defend its core interests.
- The future of U.S. national security depends on the ability to embrace change and reimagine defense in an era of renewed great power rivalry. 





## Chapter 11: Bureaucracy Does Its Thing

### The Case of the USS Harry Truman: A Microcosm of Bureaucratic Inertia

* In 2019, Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer sought to modernize the Navy's fleet by retiring the USS Harry Truman, an aircraft carrier, to free up funds for new technologies. 

#### The Rationale for Retiring the Truman

* The Truman was due for a costly mid-life refueling.
* Retiring the ship would save \$3.5 billion in refueling costs and \$30 billion in operating and maintenance costs over its remaining lifespan.
* These savings could fund investments in unmanned vessels and other advanced capabilities.

#### Congressional and Industry Backlash

* Congress, caught off guard by the proposal, reacted negatively due to a lack of prior consultation and the perceived risk of replacing a proven asset with unproven technologies.
* Congressional representatives from states heavily invested in the Truman's maintenance and shipbuilding industry, along with lobbyists and unions, mobilized to block the retirement.

#### The White House Reversal

*  Vice President Mike Pence, in a politically motivated move, announced the reversal of the Truman's retirement during a visit to the ship in Virginia, a key state for the upcoming presidential election.

#### The Outcome

* The Truman's retirement was canceled, and Congress allocated additional funds to keep it operational, diverting resources from future capabilities.
* This epitomizes the difficulty of enacting meaningful change within the defense establishment due to bureaucratic inertia, political maneuvering, and the influence of special interest groups.

### The Budget Process: A Cycle of Short-Term Thinking 

* The annual defense budget process, totaling nearly \$700 billion for fiscal year 2020, exemplifies the prioritization of short-term needs over long-term strategic investments. 

#### Challenges of the Budget Process:

* **Lengthy and Inflexible:** The multi-year budget planning cycle (currently five years) hinders adaptability to emerging technologies and changing security threats. 
* **Congressional Constraints:**  Congress often restricts the Pentagon's budgetary flexibility, limiting the ability to reallocate funds to new priorities. For example, reprogramming funds often requires approval from multiple congressional committees and is capped at a tiny fraction of the total budget (less than 0.009%).
* **Focus on Existing Programs:**  The majority of the budget is pre-allocated to existing programs, making it challenging to secure funding for new technologies.

####  The Power of "Communities of Interest"

* **Decentralized Power Structure:**  Power within the Pentagon is distributed among various "communities of interest" (e.g., different branches of the military, specific weapons programs). These groups wield significant influence over budgetary decisions.
* **Bottom-Up Budgeting:** Budget proposals often originate from these communities, focused on maintaining existing programs rather than driving innovation or embracing disruptive technologies.
* **Short-Term Incentives:** Military personnel and civilian officials are incentivized to prioritize the programs and platforms within their communities of interest, as this impacts their careers and funding.  

### A Flawed System: From Requirements to Acquisition

* The U.S. defense establishment faces systemic challenges beyond budgeting, hindering its ability to adapt and modernize effectively.

#### The Requirements Process: Stifling Innovation

* **Purpose:** To determine and validate necessary military capabilities for development or acquisition.
* **Challenges:**
  * **Bureaucratic Delays:** The process can take years, leaving the military with outdated or inadequate equipment.
  * **Consensus-Driven:** This often leads to a focus on the lowest common denominator and a resistance to high-risk, high-reward technologies.
  * **Lack of Vision:** The process frequently fails to anticipate future needs or consider the potential of emerging technologies.

#### The Acquisition Process: Slow and Risk-Averse

* **Purpose:**  To acquire the capabilities identified in the requirements process.
* **Challenges:**
  * **Excessive Bureaucracy:** The process is notoriously slow, risk-averse, and bogged down in regulations and paperwork.
  * **Focus on Traditional Systems:**  There's a bias toward acquiring familiar technologies and upgrading existing systems, even when revolutionary solutions are available.
  * **Lack of Accountability:** The diffuse decision-making structure often means that no single individual is empowered to take risks or accelerate the acquisition of vital technologies.

### The Political and Cultural Dimensions of Inertia

* **Short-Term Political Incentives:** Elected officials prioritize immediate concerns of their constituents and are less likely to champion long-term investments in defense innovation that may not yield immediate political benefits.
* **The Influence of Special Interests:**  While lobbying by defense contractors plays a role, the bigger issue is the dwindling number of major defense companies and the outsized influence of those focused on legacy systems. This limits competition and innovation.
* **Decline in Military Experience in Congress:** The declining number of lawmakers with direct military experience can lead to both excessive deference to the military's judgment and a lack of understanding of its complexities.
* **Lack of Technical Expertise:** The absence of technical backgrounds among political and military leaders hinders the understanding and adoption of emerging technologies.
* **Resistance to Disruption:** The shift to new technologies, while necessary, will inevitably cause economic and social disruption, creating resistance from those whose livelihoods depend on legacy systems. 

### The Trump Factor

* While not solely responsible for the dysfunction, the Trump presidency has exacerbated existing problems.
* **Politicization of the Military:** Trump has frequently used the military for political purposes, diverting resources and attention away from long-term strategic priorities.
* **Leadership Vacancies:** Prolonged vacancies in key civilian positions within the Department of Defense have hampered decision-making and stalled progress on essential initiatives. 

### A Crisis of Leadership and Imagination

* The challenges facing the U.S. defense establishment run deeper than any single administration or political party.  There's a fundamental failure:
  * **Failure of Imagination:** To anticipate and adapt to the rapidly evolving landscape of warfare in the 21st century.
  * **Failure of Leadership:** To make difficult choices, challenge the status quo, and prioritize long-term national security over short-term political expediency. 

### Urgent Need for Change: A Call to Action

* The U.S. must urgently address these systemic issues to maintain its military edge and confront future challenges.
* Overcoming bureaucratic inertia, political dysfunction, and a culture of short-term thinking is paramount. 
* Failure to do so risks the security and prosperity of the United States in an increasingly dangerous world.







## Chapter 12: How the Future Can Win 

### The Need for Change in U.S. Defense 

This chapter argues that the U.S. defense establishment needs significant change to adapt to future challenges. The author uses the case study of the JSTARS program and draws parallels to historical examples like the adoption of aircraft carriers and ICBMs to illustrate the need for a new approach. The chapter focuses on two key elements: 

* **Incentives:** Rewarding innovation, agility, and the development of technologies that address future threats. 
* **Imagination:**  Moving beyond traditional platforms and doctrines to embrace new ways of warfare and leverage emerging technologies. 

###  Case Study: The JSTARS Program 

- **The Problem:** The Air Force's plan to replace the aging JSTARS aircraft, a vital intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platform, with a new version of the same aircraft. 
  - This plan was flawed because the new JSTARS would be vulnerable to attacks from advanced adversaries like China and Russia. 

- **The Solution:**  The Air Force proposed disaggregating JSTARS's capabilities, distributing them across a network of unmanned aircraft and satellites. This approach offered greater resilience and survivability. 
- **The Challenge:** Powerful members of Congress and defense contractors who stood to benefit from the continued production of the traditional JSTARS aircraft opposed the Air Force's plan. 
- **The Success:** The Air Force's success in shifting to the new program stemmed from several factors:
  - **Political Strategy:** Early and candid engagement with key stakeholders in Congress.
  - **Transparency:** Providing detailed information about the threat to JSTARS and the advantages of the new program. 
  - **Industry Engagement:** Informing defense companies about the new plan, enabling them to lobby Congress.
  - **Compromise:**  Basing elements of the future program in the same state that would have hosted JSTARS, securing support from potential opponents.
- **The Lesson:** Even good ideas require political maneuvering and strategic compromise to succeed within the existing defense system. 

### Obstacles to Change and Reasons for Hope 

- **Obstacles:** The U.S. defense establishment faces significant obstacles to change, including:
  - **Parochial Military Services:**  Prioritizing their own interests over joint solutions. 
  - **Self-Interested Companies:** Focusing on profits and protecting existing programs. 
  - **Distracted Political Leaders:**  Lacking focus on long-term defense planning and more concerned with short-term political gains. 
- **Reasons for Hope:** Despite these obstacles, the United States possesses key elements for successful adaptation:
  - **Financial Resources:**  Ample funding for defense.
  - **Technological Leadership:** Access to cutting-edge technologies. 
  - **Skilled Workforce:**  A talented pool of engineers and innovators. 
- **The Core Issue:** The main obstacle lies in Washington, D.C., and stems from:
  - **Dysfunctional Political System:** Hampering the ability to make tough but necessary decisions. 
  - **Lack of Vision:**  A failure to envision and implement necessary defense reforms. 
  - **Urgency Deficit:**  A lack of urgency to drive change. 

### Restructuring Incentives for a Future-Ready Military 

- **The Imperative:** To prepare for future threats, the U.S. must restructure its defense incentives to favor:
  - **Networked Kill Chains:**  Over legacy platforms. 
  - **New Ways of War:**  Over familiar doctrines.
  - **Defense:** Over offense.
  - **Future Needs:**  Over present requirements. 
  - **Software:** Over hardware.
  - **Rapid Capability Development:**  Over acquisition compliance and cost accounting.
  - **Technological Diversity:**  Over reliance on traditional defense contractors. 
- **The Mechanism:** Achieving this shift necessitates:
  - **Leadership Ownership:** Senior leaders in the Department of Defense and Congress must champion and drive change. 
  - **Collaboration:** A partnership between the Pentagon and Congress to establish shared expectations and present a unified front to stakeholders.
  - **Long-Term Vision:** Recognizing that transforming the military is a multi-year process requiring sustained commitment. 
- **Defining the Problems:**  Translating vague concepts into actionable operational problems, such as:
  - **Denying China Military Dominance:** Specifically, developing the capability to neutralize 350 Chinese ships within the first three days of a conflict, a challenge requiring advanced ISR, real-time information sharing, and rapid decision-making. 
- **Shifting the Paradigm:** Moving away from traditional requirements and budget processes towards:
  - **Mission-Focused Competitions:**  Allocating significant funding to real-world competitions that identify the best solutions to specific operational challenges. 
  - **Rewarding Winners:** Providing substantial funding and fielding opportunities to the winners of these competitions, regardless of their affiliation (military service, established company, or startup).
  - **Embracing Rivalry:**  Leveraging the inherent rivalries between military branches and companies to drive innovation and accelerate the development of effective solutions. 
- **Transitioning Incrementally:** Acknowledging that the shift from legacy platforms to future technologies will be gradual:
  - **Initial Enhancement:** New technologies will initially enhance existing platforms. 
  - **Gradual Replacement:**  Over time, new technologies may replace legacy systems entirely. 
  - **Mission Adaptation:**  Traditional platforms may find new roles, such as homeland defense, as their relevance in high-intensity conflicts diminishes. 
- **The Power of Demonstration:** Showing, not just telling, to build support for change:
  - **Deterrence through Demonstration:**  Convincing adversaries of U.S. military capabilities by showcasing new technologies. 
  - **Domestic Persuasion:** Demonstrating the effectiveness of new solutions to skeptical military leaders and policymakers to build domestic political support. 

### Fostering a Vibrant Defense Technology Ecosystem 

- **The Problem:**  A lack of private investment in defense technology due to: 
  - **Perceived Risk:**  The defense sector is viewed as a risky investment with a high failure rate for new technologies. 
  - **Lack of Government Commitment:** The government often fails to purchase promising technologies at scale, discouraging private investment. 
- **The Solution:**  Creating incentives for private investment by:
  - **Picking Winners:** Identifying and investing heavily in companies developing essential technologies like AI and autonomous systems. 
  - **Clear Signals:** Sending strong signals to the market about the government's commitment to purchasing these technologies in large quantities. 
  - **Multiplier Effect:**  Large government contracts will attract significantly more private investment, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation and growth. 
- **Rethinking Earmarks:** Reconsidering the ban on congressional earmarks, with safeguards for transparency and accountability, to enable Congress to directly fund promising defense technologies. 
- **The Importance of Lobbying:**  Encouraging companies developing future-oriented military capabilities to actively lobby for their programs and secure political support.  
- **Addressing the "Culture Problem":**  The U.S. defense establishment needs to overcome its risk-averse, bureaucratic culture and embrace agility, competition, and a willingness to fail. 

### Conclusion: The Future Can Win 

- **The Choice:**  The U.S. has a choice: cling to the familiar but increasingly obsolete or embrace change and build a military capable of winning future conflicts. 
- **The Stakes:**  The stakes are high, with nothing less than America's national security hanging in the balance. 
- **The Path Forward:**  The path forward is clear:
  - **Define problems precisely.**
  - **Compete for solutions.**
  - **Pick winners.**
  - **Fund what matters.**
- **The Call to Action:** The future of U.S. defense depends on the willingness of its leaders to embrace change, demonstrate courage, and make the tough decisions necessary to build a military ready for the challenges ahead. 





## Conclusion: A Failure of Imagination

### Reflections on McCain's Passing and the State of America

- On three occasions since John McCain's death, the author experienced profound emotional responses:
  - **First Occasion:** Upon receiving news of McCain's passing, the author was overcome with gratitude for the time spent with him, realizing the incredible experiences they shared due to McCain's influence.
  - **Second Occasion:** During McCain's memorial service, the author hoped for positive change in Washington, a desire for unity and a focus on national security, but remained pessimistic. This pessimism stemmed from the belief that the political divisions and mistrust would resurface, hindering progress. 
  - **Third Occasion:** Visiting McCain's grave, the author felt sadness, recognizing that the situation in Washington had worsened since McCain's death, becoming more divided and dysfunctional.

 - This failure manifests in the inability to:
   - Envision the potential consequences of inaction.
   - Comprehend the severity of the challenges faced.
   - Break free from the belief in America's guaranteed success due to its past dominance.

### The Consequences of Inaction

- If America fails to adapt:
  - Others will seize the opportunity to advance their military capabilities.
  - The United States will lose control over its destiny, becoming vulnerable to its rivals.
  - Change will be forced upon America, likely through negative events such as war or a breakdown of deterrence.

### Call to Action

- The responsibility for safeguarding America's future rests on the current generation.
- While hope is essential, it is not a strategy.
- Action is urgently needed to address the challenges and avert potential disasters.

### Conclusion

- While the author acknowledges the difficulty of implementing necessary changes in a dysfunctional political environment, they emphasize the dire consequences of inaction.
- The author concludes with a stark warning: failure to adapt will result in a loss of control over America's fate.
