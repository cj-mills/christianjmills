## Introduction

- **Show of hands:** Andrew asks who makes money in the 3D industry (almost everyone).
- **Andrew's perspective:** Loves 3D work and the "childlike wonder" of bringing ideas to life. 
- **Concern:** Automation and AI potentially replacing 3D artists, despite initial belief that art couldn't be replicated by computers.
- **Examples of AI in art:**
    - Machine learning for Thanos' facial animations.
    - Algorithm applying styles of famous paintings to photos.
- **Central question:**  Will 3D artists be replaced by AI, similar to how 2D Disney animators were replaced by 3D animators?
- **Presentation focus:** How AI and automation might change the 3D industry.
- **Clarification:**  Using terms like AI and machine learning broadly, regardless of technical distinctions, as the end result is software doing artistic tasks.



## Jeff Bezos' Principle of Change 

- **Jeff Bezos' insight:** Focus on what won't change in the future, as these are the core desirables.
    - Example: Amazon customers will always want lower prices and faster delivery.
- **Application to 3D:** Any technology making things **better, faster, or cheaper** will inevitably become standard in the 3D industry.
    - Studio executives will adopt cost-saving technologies.



## The Rising Costs of Game Development

- **Raph Koster's analysis:** Game development costs increase 10x every 10 years (25% annually).
    - Based on plotting game costs from 1985 to present.
    - Logarithmic scale makes the increase appear deceptively small.
- **Projected costs:** Average AAA game might cost $200 million by 2020, exceeding feature film budgets.
- **Mobile gaming:** Initially cheap, but costs are rising due to market saturation.
- **Key takeaway:** Game development costs are unsustainable and need to be reduced.



## Asset Creation as a Major Cost Driver

- **Asset costs:**  A significant portion of game development costs are attributed to creating assets.
- **Example: Modeling a building**
    - Modeling: 12 hours.
    - Texturing: 10 hours.
    - Total: 22 hours (assuming 100% productivity, which is unrealistic).
    - Revision multiple: 2-4x due to narrative changes, design iterations, etc.
    - Cost at $60/hour: $3,900 per building.
- **Games like The Division:**  Illustrate the cumulative cost of numerous detailed assets.
- **Inefficiency of current workflow:** Static, one-to-one input-output ratio leads to repeated work.



## Leap 1: Procedural Workflows

- **Proceduralism:** Shifting from manual asset creation to defining parameters and letting software generate variations.
    - [Practical Procedural Generation for Everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WumyfLEa6bU)

- **Benefits:**
    - **Cost reduction:**  Create multiple assets with less manual labor.
    - **Creative exploration:** Forces artists to understand the underlying principles of good design and can generate unexpected ideas.
- **Anastasia Opara's example:** Created a procedural lake village in Houdini.
    - [Procedural Lake Village](https://www.anastasiaopara.com/lakevillage)
    - [Houdini Procedural Lake Houses Complete](https://anopara.gumroad.com/l/qaEZ)

- **Polygon's experience:**
    - Initially used camera-captured textures.
    - Switched to **Substance Designer** for procedural textures.

    - Bakes maps and applies smart materials from Substance Designer.
    - Adds grunge and other details procedurally.
- **Industry standard:** Leading texturing software, saving studios significant time and money.
- **Procedural advantage:** Textures can auto-update when models are changed, if the pipeline is set up correctly.

### Procedural Level Design

- **Example: Far Cry 5's ecosystem approach**
    - [Procedural World Generation of Ubisoft's Far Cry 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfizT369g60)
    - Defined rules for tree and plant placement based on factors like forest density, proximity to water, altitude.
    - Created an automatically updating environment that adapted to changes in the game world.
    - Included tools for easily adding roads and buildings.
- **The future of level design:** Procedural generation of environments, reducing manual placement and updating of assets.

### Summary of Procedural Workflows

- **Prediction:** Procedural modeling, materials, texturing, and world building will become the standard workflow.
- **Current status:** Materials and texturing are already widely adopted.
- **Next steps:** Modeling and world building are likely to see increased adoption.
- **Houdini:** Currently a strong tool for procedural workflows.
- **Hope for Blender:** Andrew expresses desire for Blender to incorporate more procedural capabilities.



## Leap 2: Machine Learning Creep

- **Traditional software:**  Linear input-action-output workflow, predictable but labor-intensive.
- **Machine learning:**  Involves iterative learning and improvement through comparison with training data.
    - Input is assessed, actions are applied, and the output is compared to a dataset. 
    - The process repeats until a satisfactory output is achieved.
- **Benefits:**  Often produces superior results compared to traditional software.
- **Requirements:** 
    - Large datasets for training.
    - Fast hardware for processing.
- **Past hype vs. reality:**  Initial excitement about machine learning five years ago didn't fully materialize due to limitations in data and hardware.
- **Current state:** Reaching a tipping point with more data and faster hardware, leading to consumer-level machine learning applications.

### Machine Learning in Denoising

- **Denoising:** Removing noise (grain) from images or videos.
- **Machine learning denoisers:**  Significantly outperform traditional denoisers.
- **NVIDIA's denoiser:**  Used in RTX graphics cards for real-time ray tracing.
    - Renders one sample per frame and applies denoising in real-time.
- **Blender's Cycles denoiser:**  Not based on machine learning, making it less effective in certain situations.
- **Disney and Pixar's denoiser:**  Addresses frame flicker issues and aims to provide artist-friendly tools.
- **NVIDIA's dominance:**  Holds numerous patents related to denoising, recognizing its potential across rendering and camera technology.

### Machine Learning in Up-Resing

- **Up-resing:** Increasing the resolution of an image.
- **AI Gigapixel (Topaz Labs):**  Consumer-level software demonstrating the power of machine learning in up-resing.
- **Andrew's test:** 
    - Rendered a kitchen scene at 50% resolution.
    - Up-resed to 200% using AI Gigapixel.
    - Compared to a 100% resolution render.
- **Results:**  The up-resed image was comparable in quality to the native 100% render, highlighting potential time and resource savings.

### Other Applications of Machine Learning

- **Motion capture:** 
    - [Densepose](http://densepose.org/)
    - Replacing mocap suits and dedicated studios with algorithms that analyze raw video footage.
    - Ability to estimate occluded body parts with impressive accuracy.
    - Example:  Translating dog motion capture data to game characters with seamless transitions and minimal foot sliding.
- **Prediction:**  Machine learning will become increasingly integrated into various software, automating tasks and enhancing workflows.
- **Examples:**  Photoshop, Premiere, Autodesk products, and potentially Blender.
- **Industry perspective:**  Silicon Valley companies are actively investing in machine learning.
- **Quote from Thanos facial animation team:**  "If you're not using machine learning in your software, you're doing it wrong."



## Leap 3: Machine-Assisted Creativity

- **Initial skepticism:**  Andrew initially believed that computers couldn't replicate human creativity.
- **Intent vs. assistance:**  While computers struggle with intent, they can be powerful tools for assisting creativity.

### Exploring Ideas with Machine Learning

- **Andrew's kitchen scene example:**  Illustrates the time-consuming process of iterating on designs and exploring different options.
    - Trying various lighting setups, adding or removing objects, experimenting with compositions.
    - This exploration phase can consume 50-70% of production time.
- **The potential of automated idea generation:**  Software that could quickly generate variations without requiring manual modeling and rendering would be invaluable.
