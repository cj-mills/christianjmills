## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have used Unity before. If you've never used Unity, you can get your feet wet with this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR0e-1UBEOU&list=PLB5_EOMkLx_VHKn4IISeNwhlDrb1948ZX&index=3).



We'll be using Unity 2019.4.13 ([download](unityhub://2019.4.13f1/518737b1de84)).



## Install Barracuda

 Next, we need to install the Barracuda package in the package manager.

Select the `Package Manager` tab in the Unity editor.

Type `Barracuda` into the search box.

Click the `Install` button to install the package.

Wait for Unity to install the dependencies.
