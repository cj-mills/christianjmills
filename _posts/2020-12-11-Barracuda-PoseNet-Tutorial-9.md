## Introduction

Different applications can require different tradeoffs between speed and accuracy. The size of the heatmaps generated by the PoseNet model is the greatest factor for balancing this tradeoff. The heatmap resolution indicates how many distinct locations the model needs to make a prediction for in the input image. The fewer distinct locations, the larger and more precise the offset values need to be. It's easier to estimate whether a key point is in a specific spot rather than how far a way it is from that spot.

The easiest way to change the heatmap size is to adjust the resolution for the input image. In this post, we'll explore how adjusting the input resolution impacts both inference speed and prediction accuracy. We'll also look at some scenarios in which the model struggles to make accurate pose estimations.

## Input Resolutions

We'll start off with an extremely low resolution and go up from there. The minimum confidence for each test is set to `80%`.

### 160 x 160 at 111fps

This is about as low a resolution we can go before the model completely falls apart. The output is barely useable even with ideal video. The model is rarely confident about it's predictions as shown below.

### 320 x 320 at 100fps

Moving up to `320p` improves model accuracy dramatically while having a small impact on performance. The model is much more confident in it's predictions. It does a solid job with the body key points. However, predictions for the nose, eyes, and ears are still not reliable.

### 480 x 480 at 85fps

This is probably the sweet spot for balancing performance and accuracy. The model's predictions are stable overall and inference speed is still fairly high.

### 640 x 640 at 59fps
